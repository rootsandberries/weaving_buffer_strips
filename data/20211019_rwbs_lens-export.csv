000-028-962-557-075,Importance of hedgerows as habitat corridors for forest plants in agricultural landscapes,,2009,journal article,Biological Conservation,00063207,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Stephan Wehling; Martin Diekmann,"Abstract Hedgerows have been proposed as habitat and conservation corridor for forest plant species, but their importance for the survival of these species is still not clear. The objective of our study was to examine the frequency of occurrence of forest species and total forest species richness in different parts of the hedgerows, and to relate these patterns of occurrence to the species’ habitat requirements and life history traits. We surveyed in total 130 forest-hedgerow transects in North-western Germany, including three age classes. About 77% of all forest plant species (including some endangered taxa) occurring in the neighbouring forests were also found in the adjacent hedgerows. In all age classes, there was a negative relationship between distance from the forest-hedgerow ecotone and the number of species. Ancient hedgerows were not significantly more species-rich than more recent ones. Within 100 m distance from the forest edge, forest species richness increased with an increasing number of species in the nearby forest and with an increasing cover of the tree canopy as well as a decreasing cover of the shrub layer. Species with high frequency had comparatively high Ellenberg indicator values for light, and were mostly associated with anemochorous and epizoochorous seed dispersal. The frequency of occurrence in hedgerows of species with common attributes was partly in agreement, partly in disagreement with the results obtained in previous studies. We conclude that patterns are difficult to generalize, probably due to a strong regional variation in the pool of forest species and in the specific environments of both forests and hedgerows.",142,11,2522,2530,Old-growth forest; Endangered species; Seed dispersal; Habitat; Global biodiversity; Ecology; Ecotone; Geography; Wildlife corridor; Species richness; Agroforestry,,,,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/766751 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320709002456 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320709002456 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103079005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2009.05.023,,10.1016/j.biocon.2009.05.023,2043999265,,0,001-555-373-960-238; 002-874-438-870-319; 007-221-361-423-978; 007-513-938-529-086; 011-749-588-004-356; 011-817-622-257-771; 015-976-025-076-335; 016-933-839-104-514; 018-300-493-662-705; 019-678-192-960-072; 021-907-377-633-412; 022-609-146-511-814; 024-608-779-166-000; 025-489-289-663-693; 026-524-247-263-808; 026-926-325-058-247; 028-714-759-335-852; 030-388-440-825-295; 030-977-663-351-619; 031-712-522-366-166; 035-857-688-042-308; 038-361-105-216-688; 039-524-631-746-697; 042-092-928-204-292; 042-530-992-835-782; 043-455-371-359-823; 046-559-721-405-224; 047-949-455-932-004; 051-197-969-663-775; 055-312-937-071-683; 056-853-001-254-085; 058-767-657-165-968; 058-965-130-329-871; 062-830-758-105-650; 063-207-503-700-767; 068-061-324-831-836; 068-143-605-669-192; 069-222-611-667-46X; 071-601-864-758-089; 075-235-467-560-472; 083-176-278-282-728; 084-101-049-675-878; 084-744-111-694-770; 086-838-473-034-93X; 087-489-927-388-278; 091-812-760-612-259; 096-835-160-953-686; 098-520-454-909-513; 117-998-580-560-965; 149-673-684-724-149; 154-750-119-428-838; 162-928-341-514-548; 165-123-901-414-731; 168-592-107-353-063; 174-706-848-200-347,66

J. Fuller; R. J. Trevelyan; R. W. Hudson,"build models containing 2-, 3- and 4-variables. Two approaches were used to combine data from the six years and models based on the single best subset in each year were found to be most consistent with respect to predictor selection. Predictors were tested by building models based on each combination of five years and assessing how well the predictors explained variation in the bird variables for the sixth, independent year. The predictors were relatively successful in explaining variations in densities of wren, robin, willow warbler, blue tit, great tit and chaffinch but especially AXIS1 which was explained in terms of woodland density, field size and altitude. Th.e predictors were unsuccessful in explaining total bird density, song thrush density and whitethroat density. Structural attributes of landscape (especially density of hedgerow and woodland, but also rivers and ponds) were frequent predictors of species densities, but variables relating to farming system were not, with the exception of skylark and yellowhammer which were positively associated with extent of cereal crops. Implications for landscape design and management, and the relative contribution of woodland and hedgerows to bird communities in farmland landscapes are discussed. There was considerable variation between individual years which suggests that models of bird-habitat relationships based on single years may have limited general application.",20,3,295,307,Landscape design; Explained variation; Habitat; Ecology; Population density; Woodland; Geography; Warbler; Yellowhammer; Altitude,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/3682841 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1997.tb00374.x/abstract http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1997.tb00374.x/abstract https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1997.tb00374.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1997.tb00374.x,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.1997.tb00374.x,2081016835,,0,000-925-852-080-712; 002-234-862-186-238; 008-818-755-662-005; 013-709-724-948-295; 015-198-673-520-248; 015-737-658-379-135; 023-310-699-181-261; 029-904-475-177-008; 030-388-683-032-986; 032-245-730-539-873; 035-764-344-352-422; 038-938-722-350-317; 045-315-437-841-363; 046-855-094-403-882; 050-657-341-867-295; 061-375-521-515-557; 065-063-552-732-952; 066-347-110-782-638; 071-601-656-233-384; 072-224-176-896-782; 074-197-517-203-385; 079-168-551-130-991; 083-911-525-099-217; 085-372-195-731-912; 102-860-044-759-667; 103-019-283-517-047; 110-766-047-364-379; 115-349-762-626-504; 120-514-812-606-235; 144-496-244-396-544; 167-246-603-611-22X; 170-518-529-775-81X; 171-513-511-936-682,83

Non-submerged, temporarily submerged, and always submerged, sites are considered in both winter and summer. It is shown that capacities for epuration are elevated for nitrate loads from the alluvial aquifer during the lateral transfer of water from agricultural land to the river through the riparian zone. About 30 m of groundwater flow under the riparian wood studied is sufficient to remove all nitrate. Denitrification rates up to 50 mg N2 per m2 per day were observed in the field, but a potential for more denitrification exists. The efficiency of the riparian woods as natural filters regulating nutrient transfers to the river deserves more consideration in river management.",2,4,507,516,Riparian zone; Groundwater flow; Nutrient; Riparian forest; Soil water; Nitrate; Hydrology; Environmental science; Denitrification; Surface water,,,,,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/13625/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rrr.3450020404,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rrr.3450020404,,10.1002/rrr.3450020404,1973384965,,0,000-789-641-528-253; 002-391-206-959-000; 002-570-479-419-484; 003-048-635-359-589; 008-921-997-255-010; 017-915-940-603-585; 018-143-015-127-12X; 019-124-400-633-38X; 019-345-736-088-599; 020-431-217-232-882; 021-655-043-206-658; 024-295-328-499-637; 028-408-422-000-787; 029-233-314-282-275; 029-274-571-592-996; 029-887-967-468-096; 032-623-027-084-083; 035-047-369-174-157; 041-077-325-941-179; 041-559-307-895-617; 046-746-883-879-127; 047-522-397-491-315; 050-099-898-107-660; 050-888-912-262-782; 050-931-516-635-883; 051-300-020-215-135; 051-745-254-723-53X; 056-621-569-881-388; 060-923-589-876-250; 061-584-802-366-085; 062-447-210-102-444; 072-556-526-406-079; 073-636-957-571-515; 079-789-931-625-023; 083-258-693-486-102; 085-456-142-165-652; 087-025-838-003-158; 087-138-533-405-771; 100-364-631-510-844; 114-454-006-239-670; 116-456-480-495-614; 125-843-673-226-951; 140-065-240-418-718; 141-101-347-131-583; 142-915-660-144-988; 158-900-005-922-99X; 162-337-157-677-385; 164-208-022-734-727; 174-885-636-304-538,213

Wes Burger; Eric T. Linder,"Transformations of agricultural practices in the southeastern United States have drastically reduced preexisting quantities of strip-cover habitat along field margins. The National Conservation Buffer Initiative has promoted the establishment of herbaceous field borders to restore wildlife benefits once provided by such habitat. We evaluated effects of native warm-season grass field border establishment and width on winter bird response. Narrow (approx. 8-m) field borders represented a marginal improvement to non-bordered margins that were cropped ditch to ditch, whereas wide (approx. 30-m) borders significantly enhanced total avian conservation value, abundance, species richness, and sparrow abundance compared to non- or narrow borders. Furthermore, presence of wide borders altered bird use of row-crop fields. We observed increased sparrow (Emberizidae) abundances in agricultural fields adjacent to wide borders, which likely resulted from enhanced waste grain foraging opportunities. Given these benefits to wintering farmland birds, we advocate the integration of herbaceous field border habitat in agricultural landscapes, particularly borders of enhanced width.",71,6,1917,1923,Foraging; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Emberizidae; Ditch; Sparrow; Wildlife; Species richness; Abundance (ecology),,,,,https://www.bioone.org/doi/10.2193/2006-119 http://www.fwrc.msstate.edu/bobwhite/pubs/Conover%20et%20al%20%202007_winter%20bird%20use%20of%20field%20borders.pdf https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2193/2006-119 https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-wildlife-management/volume-71/issue-6/2006-119/Winter-Avian-Community-and-Sparrow-Response-to-Field-Border-Width/10.2193/2006-119.pdf http://www.privatelandownernetwork.org/pdfs/Conover%20et%20al%20%202007_winter%20bird%20use%20of%20field%20borders.pdf https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2193/2006-119 https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2193/2006-119 https://www.fwrc.msstate.edu/bobwhite/pubs/Conover%20et%20al%20%202007_winter%20bird%20use%20of%20field%20borders.pdf http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2193/2006-119/abstract https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Wildlife-Management/volume-71/issue-6/2006-119/Winter-Avian-Community-and-Sparrow-Response-to-Field-Border-Width/10.2193/2006-119.full,http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2006-119,,10.2193/2006-119,2152300420,,0,000-006-765-483-604; 003-510-625-031-181; 007-345-255-242-473; 017-298-227-855-778; 023-988-333-433-443; 024-700-318-592-367; 026-227-080-397-351; 027-356-962-068-696; 030-689-407-616-423; 032-232-171-811-451; 037-574-041-312-656; 041-849-081-349-271; 061-401-711-406-024; 062-897-650-482-848; 071-039-306-543-053; 084-250-234-469-178; 089-432-459-576-010; 093-843-626-385-678; 099-489-835-604-151; 100-074-711-787-100; 107-700-101-885-23X; 115-611-647-492-038; 117-166-578-083-934; 118-607-171-279-166; 119-334-550-015-609; 133-199-519-838-349; 143-615-245-322-881; 145-112-646-303-735; 149-594-572-892-345; 151-940-400-036-949; 162-932-673-062-383; 190-958-809-912-094; 191-508-311-193-465,22

Wiggers; J. van Ruijven; Frank Berendse; G.R. de Snoo,"Over the last six decades, populations of wader species like the Black-tailed Godwit (Limosa limosa) have sharply decreased in the Netherlands. Agricultural intensification has led to reduced habitat quality for meadow birds. As a consequence, reproductive success has declined. One of the main drivers of this decline in reproductive success is reduced food availability for meadow bird chicks. Agri-environment schemes (AES), designed to halt this decline, have so far been insufficient. Most of these AES focus on entire fields, but recent research suggests that differences in suitability exist within fields. Grass field margins may be more suitable for meadow bird chicks than the center of intensively managed grass lands. To improve existing meadow bird AES it could be beneficial to implement additional management in field margins of intensively managed grass fields. An already existing type of field margin AES with additional management is the botanical field margin. Here, we evaluate four different types of field margin management, including botanical field margins, focusing on aerial insects (an important part of the diet of Black-tailed Godwit chicks and Redshank chicks) in field centers and margins.

J. Wagner; H. A. Elliott; R. C. Brandt; Deepak Jaiswal,"Vegetated buffers strips typically have limited ability to reduce delivery of dissolved phosphorus (DP) from agricultural fields to surface waters. A field study was conducted to evaluate the ability of buffer strips enhanced with drinking water treatment residuals (WTRs) to control runoff P losses from surface-applied biosolids characterized by high water-extractable P (4 g kg(-)(1)). Simulated rainfall (62.4 mm h(-1)) was applied to grassed plots (3 m x 10.7 m including a 2.67 m downslope buffer) surface-amended with biosolids at 102 kg P ha(-1) until 30 min of runoff was collected. With buffer strips top-dressed with WTR (20 Mg ha(-1)), runoff total P (TP = 2.5 mg L(-1)) and total DP (TDP = 1.9 mg L(-1)) were not statistically lower (alpha = 0.05) compared to plots with unamended grass buffers (TP = 2.7 mg L(-1); TDP = 2.6 mg L(-1)). Although the applied WTR had excess capacity (Langmuir P maxima of 25 g P kg(-1)) to sorb all runoff P, kinetic experiments suggest that sheet flow travel time across the buffers ( approximately 30 s) was insufficient for significant P reduction. Effective interception of dissolved P in runoff water by WTR-enhanced buffer strips requires rapid P sorption kinetics and hydrologic flow behavior ensuring sufficient runoff residence time and WTR contact in the buffer. Substantial phosphate-adsorbent contact opportunity may be more easily achieved by incorporating WTRs into P-enriched soils or blending WTRs with applied P sources.",37,4,1567,1574,Environmental chemistry; Langmuir; Soil water; Chemistry; Water treatment; Biosolids; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Phosphorus; Sewage; Environmental engineering,,Kinetics; Phosphorus/isolation & purification; Rain; Sewage; Water Supply/analysis,Sewage; Phosphorus,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18574189 https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/37/4/1567 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2134/jeq2007.0338 https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/managing-biosolids-runoff-phosphorus-using-buffer-strips-enhanced,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2007.0338,18574189,10.2134/jeq2007.0338,2011142914,,0,000-176-500-656-479; 001-908-089-856-16X; 002-333-471-468-522; 002-640-861-377-175; 002-843-713-046-18X; 003-121-034-153-145; 004-921-740-394-781; 008-019-997-495-149; 008-380-052-396-94X; 010-488-156-142-430; 014-525-359-505-233; 017-083-163-368-883; 017-251-457-260-042; 020-224-860-596-253; 020-562-128-865-020; 024-577-370-490-041; 030-743-587-263-569; 031-090-262-003-727; 042-064-169-219-857; 048-354-203-389-31X; 048-719-181-187-141; 057-468-812-279-02X; 057-581-987-840-872; 060-667-957-941-985; 065-786-961-178-058; 069-115-983-163-699; 077-440-612-423-091; 078-349-074-228-625; 093-310-325-727-150; 104-025-416-584-989; 104-642-076-468-933; 106-259-976-630-538; 106-617-775-406-254; 111-288-588-656-115; 114-311-980-772-42X; 114-435-423-831-081; 119-606-666-887-202; 134-055-162-137-649; 135-999-444-281-547; 138-847-931-539-572; 153-696-436-020-894; 164-295-321-207-730; 184-069-778-820-105; 192-984-369-411-22X,28

Hoverflies were observed quantitatively and were divided according to their larval food. In both years, distinctly more aphidophagous and aquatic hoverflies were observed in the weed strips than in the adjacent fields. Copro- and phytophagous hoverflies were observed in very low numbers and they were almost entirely confined to the weed strips and the field boundary. The weed strips contained a high density of flowering plants and therefore proved to be very attractive feeding places for all hoverflies.

Bruggisser; Nadine Sandau; Gilles Blandenier; Yvonne Fabian; Patrik Kehrli; Alex Aebi; Russell E. Naisbit; Louis-Félix Bersier,"Abstract Species abundance in local communities is determined by bottom-up and top-down processes, which can act directly and indirectly on the focal species. Studies examining these effects simultaneously are rare. Here we explore the direct top-down and direct and indirect bottom-up forces regulating the abundance and predation success of an intermediate predator, the web-building spider Argiope bruennichi (Araneae: Araneidae). We manipulated plant diversity (2, 6, 12 or 20 sown species) in 9 wildflower strips in a region of intensive farmland. To identify the major factors regulating the distribution and abundance of A. bruennichi, we quantified three characteristics of vegetation (species diversity, composition and vegetation structure) as well as the spider's prey community and natural enemies. The distribution and abundance of A. bruennichi was regulated by combined bottom-up and top-down processes as well as by direct and indirect interactions between trophic levels. Four main factors were identified: (1) the strong direct effect of vegetation structure, (2) the positive effect of plant species diversity, which affected spider abundance directly and indirectly through increased densities and size of flower-visiting prey species, (3) the positive or negative direct effects of different plant species, and (4) the strongly negative direct effect of predacious hornets. The advantage of taking a global approach to understand the regulation of species abundance is highlighted first by the quantification of the relative importance of factors, with a surprisingly strong effect of hornet predators, and second by the discovery of a direct effect of plant diversity, which raises intriguing questions about habitat selection by this spider.",13,8,706,714,Relative species abundance; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Argiope bruennichi; Spider; Species diversity; Trophic level; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179112001296 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179112001296 http://doc.rero.ch/record/211444 https://www.unifr.ch/biology/assets/files/bersier/basic_and_applied_ecology_bruggisser_2012.pdf https://doc.rero.ch/record/211444/files/Bruggisser_O._-_Direct_and_indirect_bottom-up.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2012.10.001,,10.1016/j.baae.2012.10.001,2012774580,,0,007-395-328-016-385; 008-436-951-507-439; 010-225-312-935-498; 011-839-569-702-22X; 013-994-533-427-425; 015-322-386-681-933; 015-790-636-586-427; 017-402-843-993-223; 018-645-414-730-196; 019-140-602-318-134; 021-854-472-647-242; 022-321-534-473-933; 023-888-326-247-353; 027-483-858-126-86X; 029-264-077-202-287; 029-324-991-196-140; 039-112-596-230-618; 040-524-368-527-862; 043-065-405-983-357; 061-779-015-538-909; 063-141-893-182-571; 063-593-316-301-291; 067-655-240-305-558; 069-559-278-898-558; 071-350-691-756-400; 074-657-096-997-491; 077-841-358-017-983; 078-139-286-626-064; 080-946-104-061-684; 081-930-520-530-902; 084-893-330-370-820; 088-710-088-449-565; 090-637-596-119-953; 092-914-880-817-287; 093-389-302-172-409; 093-525-655-948-608; 096-717-963-459-246; 098-939-648-476-800; 108-401-586-520-488; 108-710-073-825-242; 111-148-023-468-083; 119-930-944-113-608; 121-366-382-050-525; 121-954-134-376-260; 133-014-970-838-788; 133-068-333-483-834; 134-625-227-874-781; 136-375-850-103-819; 139-731-348-028-080; 145-523-815-049-35X; 163-360-463-534-464; 163-548-412-049-287; 167-939-813-452-150; 176-487-968-801-222; 180-906-692-394-694; 181-030-964-660-195; 192-154-598-835-242; 195-723-801-643-50X,14

Raich; Thomas M. Isenhart; Richard C. Schultz,"This study was conducted to determine biomass dynamics, carbon sequestration and plant nitrogen immobilization in multispecies riparian buffers, cool-season grass buffers and adjacent crop fields in central Iowa. The seven-year-old multispecies buffers were composed of poplar (Populus×euroamericana ‘Eugenei’) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.). The cool-season grass buffers were dominated by non-native forage grasses (Bromus inermis Leysser., Phleum pratense L. and Poa pratensis L). Crop fields were under an annual corn-soybean rotation. Aboveground non-woody live and dead biomass were determined by direct harvests throughout two growing seasons. The dynamics of fine (0–2 mm) and small roots (2–5 mm) were assessed by sequentially collecting 35 cm deep, 5.4 cm diameter cores (125 cm deep cores in the second year) from April through November. Biomass of poplar trees was estimated using allometric equations developed by destructive sampling of trees. Poplar had the greatest aboveground live biomass, N and C pools, while switchgrass had the highest mean aboveground dead biomass, C and N pools. Over the two-year sampling period, live fine root biomass and root C and N in the riparian buffers were significantly greater than in crop fields. Growing-season mean biomass, C and N pools were greater in the multispecies buffer than in either of the crop fields or cool-season grass buffers. Rates of C accumulation in plant and litter biomass in the planted poplar and switchgrass stands averaged 2960 and 820 kg C ha−1 y−1, respectively. Nitrogen immobilization rates in the poplar stands and switchgrass sites averaged 37 and 16 kg N ha−1 y−1, respectively. Planted riparian buffers containing native perennial species therefore have the potential to sequester C from the atmosphere, and to immobilize N in biomass, therefore slowing or preventing N losses to the atmosphere and to ground and surface waters.",57,3,187,198,Riparian zone; Growing season; Poa pratensis; Forage; Biomass; Panicum virgatum; Bromus inermis; Environmental science; Nitrogen cycle; Botany; Agronomy,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Schultz3/publication/216814772_Biomass_carbon_and_nitrogen_dynamics_of_multi-species_riparian_buffers_within_an_agricultural_watershed_in_Iowa_USA/links/54d785ba0cf25013d039a3fa.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1024898615284 http://www.eeob.iastate.edu/classes/EEOB-590A/marshcourse/Isenhart/Tufekcioglu2003.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1024898615284,,10.1023/a:1024898615284,996022,,0,001-202-755-458-16X; 002-937-270-631-538; 007-017-276-745-587; 009-634-109-530-622; 010-743-591-953-903; 011-264-237-105-125; 021-310-890-813-156; 023-889-860-756-398; 036-469-957-446-549; 036-628-405-890-524; 040-229-676-588-390; 043-056-074-783-443; 043-306-954-021-323; 050-408-198-018-161; 054-260-073-138-044; 074-622-137-766-471; 079-789-931-625-023; 081-798-137-692-591; 089-761-876-776-176; 090-995-512-832-824; 111-500-589-834-521; 117-992-826-323-082; 121-468-243-703-60X; 121-505-199-767-760; 127-785-284-544-120; 141-101-347-131-583; 157-010-697-344-025; 180-524-585-737-168; 194-376-138-350-814,145

Invertebrates were most abundant in hedgerows and adjacent vegetation during the summer when the diet of the Dunnock was largely insectivorous. Beetles (Coleoptera) were the main taxa in the diet, with weevils (Curculionidae) and rove beetles (Staphylinidae) predominating. Arachnids were important, and snails (Gastropoda), earthworms (Oligochaeta), springtails (Collembola) and flies (Diptera) were taken. Seeds were available in the study area from July and featured in the diet from August to April. Nettle Urtica dioica comprised the main seed in the diet. Other important seeds included Yorkshire fog Holcus lanatus, elder Sambucus nigra and dock Rumex obtusifolius. Stomach stones were most common in the faeces in winter. The Dunnocks were predominantly ground feeders and mainly used a hop-picking technique. Some seeds and invertebrates were picked directly off plants by Dunnocks above the ground. Most feeding occurred in hedgerows, which formed a small proportion of the study area. Overgrown hedgerows were the most important of the five hedgerow types. Nettle patches were an important feeding habitat. Dunnocks usually foraged alone or in pairs and rarely fed in association with other bird species.

O'Neal; Rene Hessel; Lisa A. Schulte; Matthew J. Helmers,"Reconstructing prairie vegetation in row crop-dominated agricultural landscapes may contribute to several ecosystem services, including the biological control of insect pests, such as the soybean aphid Aphis glycines Matsumura. The influence of the amount and configuration of reconstructed prairie vegetation on the delivery of ecosystem services was investigated in several small catchments at Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge in Iowa. Treatments include catchments entirely in row crops under a no-till, corn-soybean (Zea mays L.-Glycine max [L.] Merrill) rotation, catchments with 10% of the land in prairie located at the base, and catchments with 10 or 20% of the land in multiple contour strips of prairie. During 2009 and 2011 growing seasons, we measured abundance and diversity of aphidophagous insect predators in response to treatment and habitat type (i.e., soybean, prairie). In 2011, we further studied the biological control of soybean aphids by artificially infesting uncaged and caged plants to prevent exposure from predators. While aphidophagous predators were more abundant in prairie, populations of key aphid predators did not significantly differ among treatments. Biological control of the soybean aphid did not differ among treatments or with distance from prairie. Our results suggest that prairie strips, in addition to providing soil and water quality benefits, may increase the populations of beneficial insects, but may not directly impact biocontrol. We propose several hypotheses to explain why we did not observe more soybean aphid predation with the increased abundance of aphidophagous predators in catchments containing prairie.",43,5,1185,1197,Growing season; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Grassland; Aphid; Soybean aphid; Beneficial insects; Agronomy; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,Agriculture; Animals; Aphids/physiology; Conservation of Natural Resources; Grassland; Insecta/physiology; Iowa; Population Dynamics; Predatory Behavior; Seasons; Soybeans/growth & development; Spiders/physiology; Zea mays/growth & development,,,https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/43/5/1185/566261 https://bioone.org/journals/environmental-entomology/volume-43/issue-5/EN13129/The-Impact-of-Prairie-Strips-on-Aphidophagous-Predator-Abundance-and/10.1603/EN13129.full http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1259&context=ent_pubs https://works.bepress.com/matthew_oneal/90/download/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25199149/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25199149 https://works.bepress.com/matthew_helmers/97/ https://bioone.org/journals/environmental-entomology/volume-43/issue-5/EN13129/The-Impact-of-Prairie-Strips-on-Aphidophagous-Predator-Abundance-and/10.1603/EN13129.pdf https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/ent_pubs/259/ https://core.ac.uk/download/38941952.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/en13129,25199149,10.1603/en13129,2117619894,,0,004-115-312-279-684; 006-004-209-415-108; 006-967-044-484-843; 007-159-731-641-426; 009-172-624-760-904; 009-909-414-518-97X; 015-905-951-111-509; 018-489-917-101-293; 019-649-267-718-81X; 019-679-713-741-567; 025-714-041-289-368; 026-459-668-136-913; 026-735-761-517-671; 027-296-429-849-855; 035-695-708-749-206; 040-572-453-396-234; 042-901-456-467-656; 046-599-825-854-16X; 053-002-848-047-394; 055-192-571-710-917; 056-506-695-308-44X; 056-892-630-404-500; 062-695-736-631-335; 063-141-893-182-571; 063-623-112-364-842; 063-709-043-459-166; 064-577-336-376-035; 069-014-634-222-811; 070-043-160-900-85X; 078-071-364-053-305; 079-950-431-356-144; 086-402-015-642-906; 087-520-578-895-249; 095-104-916-898-838; 098-034-359-348-662; 105-046-517-502-996; 105-089-332-069-890; 109-691-661-850-685; 111-528-391-156-029; 111-577-380-852-580; 121-413-191-182-188; 142-556-026-926-518; 150-325-162-873-23X; 150-419-704-982-738; 160-814-066-258-368; 164-778-477-702-099,16

Paudel; Ranjith P. Udawatta; Robert J. Kremer; Stephen H. Anderson,"Soil enzyme activities and water stable aggregates have been identified as sensitive soil quality indicators, but few studies exist comparing those parameters within buffers, grazed pastures and row-crop systems. Our objective was to examine the effects of these land uses on the activities of selected enzymes (β-glucosidase, β-glucosaminidase, fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolase, and dehydrogenase), proportion of water stable aggregates (WSA), soil organic carbon and total nitrogen content. Four management treatments [grazed pasture (GP), agroforestry buffer (AgB), grass buffer (GB) and row crop (RC)] were sampled in 2009 and 2010 at two depths (0 to 10- and 10 to 20-cm) and analyzed. Most of the soil quality indicators were significantly greater under perennial vegetation when compared to row crop treatments. Although there were numerical variations, soil quality response trends were consistent between years. The β-glucosaminidase activity increased slightly from 156 to 177 μg PNP g−1 dry soil while β-glucosidase activity slightly decreased from 248 to 237 μg PNP g−1 dry soil in GB treatment during 2 years. The surface (0–10 cm depth) had greater enzyme activities and WSA than sub-surface (10–20 cm) samples. WSA increased from 178 to 314 g kg−1 in row crop areas while all other treatments had similar values during the 2 year study. The treatment by depth interaction was significant (P < 0.05) for β-glucosidase and β-glucosaminidase enzymes in 2009 and for dehydrogenase and β-glucosaminidase in 2010. Soil enzyme activities were significantly correlated with soil organic carbon content (r ≥ 0.94, P < 0.0001). This is important because soil enzyme activities and microbial biomass can be enhanced by perennial vegetation and thus improve several other soil quality parameters. These results also support the hypothesis that positive interactions among management practices, soil biota and subsequent environmental quality effects are of great agricultural and ecological importance.",84,2,311,323,Biomass (ecology); Vegetation; Perennial plant; Row crop; Soil quality; Soil fertility; Environmental science; Soil carbon; Soil biology; Agroforestry; Agronomy,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-011-9454-8/fulltext.html http://www.ars.usda.gov/sp2UserFiles/Place/36221500/cswq-0490-paudel.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10457-011-9454-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-011-9454-8,,10.1007/s10457-011-9454-8,1972987679,,0,002-275-102-975-34X; 002-548-607-793-892; 004-014-866-004-196; 004-771-960-697-150; 007-085-169-174-98X; 014-026-509-704-03X; 015-620-073-261-95X; 016-725-382-309-766; 019-536-329-533-095; 019-622-915-734-27X; 020-664-461-694-234; 025-336-740-381-256; 028-330-817-487-676; 033-344-612-422-797; 034-441-680-556-894; 035-554-523-628-345; 036-315-734-250-926; 044-214-456-182-827; 044-623-657-378-698; 046-463-182-290-90X; 046-681-813-973-463; 051-822-049-360-617; 054-245-802-372-063; 054-292-788-964-67X; 057-056-582-738-09X; 057-789-741-091-819; 057-798-446-166-229; 060-424-924-399-142; 064-872-788-307-008; 071-939-379-659-990; 072-126-095-270-201; 074-819-529-961-830; 074-864-653-310-392; 078-649-327-618-934; 079-196-971-304-319; 081-347-358-673-391; 083-172-644-867-956; 088-017-310-971-747; 088-271-447-101-666; 089-209-083-090-589; 089-267-416-283-668; 092-804-670-514-23X; 092-941-160-711-170; 094-479-438-844-724; 096-499-726-729-908; 099-009-068-726-661; 100-679-216-297-456; 107-996-158-592-679; 112-334-090-036-542; 113-314-420-599-603; 113-727-868-617-019; 116-759-930-330-613; 121-177-129-261-350; 121-412-431-776-82X; 124-188-654-521-336; 125-329-960-003-484; 129-995-958-647-803; 134-226-832-776-612; 149-633-039-918-024; 152-157-521-163-436; 157-870-228-101-338; 159-237-134-366-844; 161-671-403-526-169; 162-898-029-469-717; 175-268-583-761-593; 177-266-256-238-483; 180-216-355-380-330; 184-904-502-014-395; 185-116-269-568-509; 186-022-406-900-002; 191-359-559-824-869; 194-990-894-755-542; 195-126-483-768-634,37

Predicting the large-scale effects of changing landscape structure and management of agricultural systems on fragmented invertebrate populations requires a modelling approach in which dispersal is a critical metapopulation parameter. This paper reports the use of mark-recapture techniques in a pilot experiment to estimate dispersal, population size and distribution of two large carabids, Pterostichus melanarius and Harpalus rufipes, in a cereal field, its established hedgerow and an experimentally sown field margin. Distributions of both species changed with time, P. melanarius moving from the field margins into the cropped area, H. rufipes remaining within the hedgerow and field margins. Population size of P. melanarius was estimated at approximately 0.6 m−2. 60% of P. melanarius dispersed 0 to 2.5 m day−1 and approximately 5% moved 7.5 to 10 m day−1.",15,1-4,337,352,Population size; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Metapopulation; Harpalus rufipes; Beneficial insects; Pterostichus; Biological dispersal; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19981106660 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19981106660.html https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01448765.1997.9755208,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01448765.1997.9755208,,10.1080/01448765.1997.9755208,2019935182,,0,000-724-723-869-10X; 022-070-333-305-083; 030-652-847-337-20X; 032-720-032-061-454; 042-287-420-054-457; 043-329-639-022-790; 046-457-009-481-605; 051-103-549-479-234; 056-892-041-411-85X; 061-252-046-249-156; 087-186-786-234-321; 112-957-471-428-647; 122-593-714-312-795; 146-742-338-133-191; 192-630-203-699-413,36

During the first rainfall simulation, COD, o-P and EC levels were consistently higher in the slurry zone, more evidently in the larger amended area. During the second and third rainfall simulations, concentration and mass levels show a downslope drift into the buffer zones, with no clear buffer strip length attenuation. Correlation between runoff and mass drift is clearly higher in the slurry zone.

Raebel; Thomas Merckx; Ruth E. Feber; Philip Riordan; David J. Thompson; David W. Macdonald,"a b s t r a c t Agricultural intensification has contributed to severe declines in odonate (dragonfly and damselfly) populations. Odonates require healthy waterbodies for their larval stages and resource-rich terrestrial landscapes as adults. As such, farmland management at both local and larger landscape scales may be needed to reverse population declines. We sampled odonate adults and exuviae from lowland farmland ponds in England, to investigate relationships between odonate species richness and surrounding land-use. The more mobile dragon- flies (Anisoptera) were influenced most strongly by landscape variables at the largest scale (i.e. 1600 m radius), while less mobile damselflies (Zygoptera) were affected by variables at more local scales (i.e. 100/400 m radii). A greater number of landscape variables affected exuvial species richness compared to adult species richness. Exuvial species richness was higher when 2 m wide cross-compliance buffer strips around ponds were present. However, no ponds in the study had buffer strips that were estab- lished through England's basic agri-environment scheme (Entry Level Scheme: ELS) agreements, and we observed a negative relationship between ELS area and exuvial species richness. Exuvial species richness increased with the amount of water, but not the number of ponds, in the landscape surround- ing a focal pond. The observed odonate responses to local and surrounding land-use lend support to the development of agri-environment scheme policies that encourage landscape-scale, as well as local, scheme implementation and management. We predict that both landscape-scale and quality-targeted management of farmland ponds would benefit odonates, irrespective of mobility level and life-stage.",161,,80,87,Larva; Ecology; Geography; Dragonfly; Damselfly; Population; Anisoptera; Buffer strip; Biological dispersal; Species richness,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/34107464 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880912002757 https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:142440 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880912002757,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2012.07.015,,10.1016/j.agee.2012.07.015,2151365266,,0,000-103-713-547-965; 000-578-113-641-64X; 002-262-285-007-84X; 005-931-899-052-949; 007-289-294-932-086; 012-267-243-122-028; 014-204-563-886-62X; 014-297-924-787-009; 014-555-468-568-070; 016-007-160-835-158; 019-622-915-734-27X; 025-063-832-821-49X; 025-125-058-866-939; 030-285-119-895-818; 031-816-458-554-184; 032-494-612-708-485; 035-070-285-311-199; 038-977-129-352-92X; 039-793-188-196-410; 046-030-741-698-909; 048-500-538-364-723; 059-502-071-789-055; 059-606-184-302-078; 060-114-103-966-089; 074-562-775-743-82X; 078-040-761-311-927; 078-318-665-214-047; 082-709-077-572-908; 082-851-081-486-92X; 083-098-387-672-759; 084-365-245-206-306; 096-766-575-734-788; 097-298-518-714-758; 100-148-716-128-250; 102-366-533-082-155; 105-040-048-089-248; 105-655-508-995-139; 108-632-928-694-196; 109-802-423-459-241; 110-546-283-867-82X; 111-691-153-684-264; 114-931-660-359-908; 116-014-089-620-373; 124-319-214-482-940; 124-407-129-963-803; 150-260-537-510-335; 150-943-127-547-373; 152-152-376-465-530; 154-136-928-381-822; 154-286-254-531-882; 158-095-073-022-089; 158-198-234-615-259; 164-680-187-824-236; 169-188-131-474-924; 177-969-502-435-409; 179-517-966-221-279; 180-409-587-714-37X; 182-202-832-513-729; 188-648-925-635-80X; 197-436-304-652-203,43

Results indicated that 1) exclusion of nutrient inputs had a positive effect on plant species richness within the fi eld margins; 2) plant species richness decreased with increased distance from the hedgerow; 3) herb species richness was greatest in the 1.5m closest to the hedgerow; 4) greater abundance of invertebrates occurred within the 3.5m-wide margins; 5) successful control of Pteridium aquilinum was achieved through spot treatment with the selective herbicide ‘Asulox’; and 6) a combination of management techniques such as cutting and grazing is likely to enhance plant species richness and facilitate the structural diversity of vegetation that is necessary for many invertebrate taxa.",109,2,95,106,Quadrat; Fauna; Biodiversity; Invertebrate; Vegetation; Ecology; Grazing; Species richness; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3318/bioe.2009.109.2.95 https://www.jstor.org/stable/20694881 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20093336571.html https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093336571 http://t-stor.teagasc.ie/bitstream/11019/564/1/BioE%20PRocRIA%20109B%2095-106.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3318/bioe.2009.109.2.95,,10.3318/bioe.2009.109.2.95,2128026860,,0,002-890-902-512-882; 005-428-486-066-99X; 011-749-985-776-165; 015-072-120-385-142; 024-118-406-968-439; 025-983-895-963-761; 042-765-344-128-744; 044-910-571-164-818; 045-493-243-364-329; 056-744-336-728-454; 057-001-477-328-971; 065-565-421-487-993; 072-457-703-192-072; 078-068-143-214-104; 097-691-909-747-128; 123-152-556-774-187; 132-844-924-192-871; 145-917-517-374-56X; 149-200-651-727-319; 154-217-194-242-069; 155-691-175-864-748; 158-755-038-003-756; 168-428-436-673-266; 172-304-497-701-670; 181-292-883-987-137,2

Meyling; Mette Lübeck; Ellen P. Buckley; Jørgen Eilenberg; Stephen A. Rehner,"Although intensively investigated for biological control of insect pests, little is known about the ecology of the fungal entomopathogenic genus Beauveria in natural or agricultural habitats. In this study, we used molecular phylogenetic and genotypic information to infer species diversity, reproductive potential and genetic structure of Beauveria occurring within a single arable field and bordering hedgerow in Denmark. Isolates were sampled from cultivated field and hedgerow soils, from insects harbouring latent fungal infections, and from the phylloplanes of three plant species common in the hedgerow flora. A nuclear phylogeny of this local Beauveria assemblage resolved seven phylogenetic species, including (i) five phylogenetic species within Beauveria bassiana sensu stricto; (ii) Clade C, a taxonomically uncharacterized species that is morphologically indistinguishable but phylogenetically distant from B. bassiana s.s.; and (iii) Beauveria brongniartii. All seven species were present throughout the hedgerow habitat, including as infections in insects. Significantly, only B. bassiana s.s. phylogenetic species Eu_1 was isolated from tilled soils. Mating type polymerase chain reaction assays demonstrated that all five B. bassiana s.s. phylogenetic species possess bipolar outcrossing mating systems. Of these, only the Eu_1 population contained two mating types; however, a 31:2 skew in MAT1:MAT2 mating types suggests a low frequency of sexual reproduction in this population. The four remaining B. bassiana s.s. phylogenetic species were fixed for single mating types and these populations are evidently clonal. Multilocus microsatellite genotyping revealed polymorphism in all five phylogenetic species of B. bassiana s.s.; however, all show evidence of clonal genetic structure.",18,6,1282,1293,Phylogenetic tree; Bassiana; Beauveria; Beauveria bassiana; Population; Botany; Species diversity; Genetic diversity; Biology; Phylogenetics,,"Agriculture; Animals; Beauveria/classification; DNA, Fungal/genetics; Denmark; Ecosystem; Genes, Mating Type, Fungal; Genotype; Insecta/microbiology; Microsatellite Repeats; Phylogeny; Plants/microbiology; Polymorphism, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Soil Microbiology","DNA, Fungal",,https://vbn.aau.dk/da/publications/community-composition-host-range-and-genetic-structure-of-the-fungal-entomopathogen-beauveria-in-adjoining-agricultural-and-seminatural-habitats(0abfb490-0ca0-11de-82e6-000ea68e967b).html http://vbn.aau.dk/da/publications/community-composition-host-range-and-genetic-structure-of-the-fungal-entomopathogen-beauveria-in-adjoining-agricultural-and-seminatural-habitats(0abfb490-0ca0-11de-82e6-000ea68e967b).html https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04095.x http://www1.bio.ku.dk/forskning/oe/cse/gml_sider/media/Meyling_et_al_2009.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/MED/19226319 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19226319 http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04095.x https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093093483,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294x.2009.04095.x,19226319,10.1111/j.1365-294x.2009.04095.x,2158097558,,0,002-142-975-453-779; 007-372-763-008-054; 008-818-696-274-183; 008-877-565-012-562; 009-019-593-728-491; 012-070-211-674-945; 016-115-957-109-194; 020-697-703-023-566; 022-850-261-868-983; 028-549-241-536-08X; 029-748-737-827-612; 038-802-676-223-778; 040-865-412-579-906; 042-402-698-060-027; 043-699-148-906-282; 045-055-842-260-919; 046-357-505-546-254; 048-039-638-743-429; 050-103-545-034-071; 052-256-772-754-925; 052-951-584-268-481; 053-184-857-286-135; 053-932-648-921-949; 054-826-312-775-949; 055-181-427-415-872; 056-637-020-144-272; 058-356-018-294-783; 063-626-546-208-840; 065-585-424-631-506; 065-702-028-717-99X; 066-050-943-013-06X; 068-452-604-669-157; 069-677-755-087-334; 073-666-034-627-610; 075-655-900-010-860; 082-833-321-285-985; 083-297-230-062-129; 083-803-111-572-002; 086-012-704-565-703; 087-507-618-965-111; 089-676-787-074-686; 093-276-268-905-574; 102-462-906-494-188; 110-374-224-338-815; 111-654-508-844-640; 115-879-302-970-935; 122-155-200-696-71X; 123-805-136-634-634; 141-242-392-402-310; 142-103-971-611-666; 148-765-185-133-59X; 157-115-581-957-699; 162-949-576-134-913,113

Green; Patrick E. Osborne; E.J. Sears,"1. Passerine birds were surveyed during the breeding season in hedgerows on 46 farms in lowland England. The incidence of each species was recorded in 50-m lengths of hedgerow and various attributes of these hedgerow sections were also recorded. 2. Logistic regression models were fitted to the data to describe the effects on the incidence of 18 bird species of the number of trees, hedge height and width, dominant plant species in the woody hedge, under the hedge and adjacent to the hedge in the uncultivated strip, the number of woody species in a standard length and other hedgerow characteristics. The effects of adjacent land use and cropping, reduced use of pesticides on cereal field edges and the geographical location of the study farms were also included in the models. 3. Most bird species preferred tall hedges with many trees, but there were some (dunnock, willow warbler and lesser whitethroat) which preferred tall hedges with few trees and others (whitethroat, linnet, yellowhammer) which preferred short hedges with few trees. 4. The differences among bird species in response to a sevenfold reduction in the height of hedges estimated from the models showed good agreement with the variation among species in the effects of severe hedge cutting on bird populations at one farm observed in an independent study. 5. The incidence of six bird species was positively influenced by the number of woody species in a standard length of hedgerow. 6. The incidence of two bird species was significantly affected by the identity of the dominant woody plant species in the hedge and one species by the identity of the dominant plant species at the base of the hedge. 7. Land use adjacent to the hedgerow, categorized as grass, tillage and roadside, had a significant influence on the incidence of five species. However, there was no evidence of consistency among species in the direction of effects. 8. The crops grown on tilled land adjacent to the hedgerow had a significant influence on the incidence of the blackbird. There was a significant degree of consistency among bird species in the ranking of crops, with oil-seed rape the most preferred and spring-sown cereal the least preferred. 9. The incidence of greenfinch, robin and song thrush was significantly lower in hedgerows adjacent to autumn-sown cereals which had received reduced levels of spraying of pesticides than in those adjacent to autumn-sown cereals which were fully sprayed. Most of the other species showed non-significant differences in the same direction. Most of the species studied also showed a non-significant tendency towards higher incidence in hedgerows adjacent to spring-sown cereals with reduced spraying than in those adjacent to fully sprayed spring-sown cereals.",31,4,677,,Seasonal breeder; Woody plant; Cropping; Tillage; Ecology; Warbler; Passerine; Willow; Yellowhammer; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/1483193 https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/76197/,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2404158,,10.2307/2404158,2064285285,,0,013-709-724-948-295; 029-904-475-177-008; 056-041-050-320-014; 074-197-517-203-385; 079-168-551-130-991; 083-586-062-408-725; 110-766-047-364-379; 113-778-997-450-868; 131-055-904-362-302; 196-154-013-303-271,186

Ducey; P.R. Johnson; Anthony D. Shriner; T.A. Matheny; Patrick G. Hunt,"Riparian buffer zones are important for both natural and developed ecosystems throughout the world because of their ability to retain nutrients, prevent soil erosion, protect aquatic environments from excessive sedimentation, and filter pollutants. Despite their importance, the microbial community structures of riparian buffer zones remains poorly defined. Our objectives for this study were twofold: first, to characterize the microbial populations found in riparian buffer zone soils; and second, to determine if microbial community structure could be linked to denitrification enzyme activity (DEA). To achieve these objectives, we investigated the microbial populations of a riparian buffer zone located downslope of a pasture irrigated with swine lagoon effluent, utilizing DNA sequencing of the 16S rDNA, DEA, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) of the denitrification genes nirK, nirS, and nosZ. Clone libraries of the 16S rDNA gene were generated from each of twelve sites across the riparian buffer with a total of 986 partial sequences grouped into 654 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The Proteobacteria were the dominant group (49.8% of all OTUs), with the Acidobacteria also well represented (19.57% of all OTUs). Analysis of qPCR results identified spatial relationships between soil series, site location, and gene abundance, which could be used to infer both incomplete and total DEA rates.",7,1,99,117,Ecosystem; Aquatic ecosystem; Ecology; Riparian buffer; Acidobacteria; Proteobacteria; Environmental science; Soil series; Denitrification; Microbial population biology,16S rRNA gene.; Riparian buffer; denitrification; microbial communities,,,,https://openmicrobiologyjournal.com/VOLUME/7/PAGE/99/PDF/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23894260 https://openmicrobiologyjournal.com/VOLUME/7/PAGE/99/FULLTEXT/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/23894260 http://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOMICROJ-7-99 https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOMICROJ-7-99,http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1874285801307010099,23894260,10.2174/1874285801307010099,2123824898,PMC3722543,0,000-046-722-937-270; 001-041-814-262-227; 002-357-019-927-477; 002-597-523-791-436; 004-465-637-937-825; 005-529-207-616-833; 006-485-535-598-94X; 008-197-047-139-556; 009-256-582-324-853; 013-763-274-698-686; 015-049-741-861-396; 015-075-787-498-325; 016-475-292-873-68X; 017-446-736-687-110; 018-770-038-388-755; 020-794-031-579-055; 021-653-580-552-573; 026-317-942-977-966; 029-718-172-082-969; 030-209-100-161-14X; 032-045-920-404-500; 033-462-419-203-944; 033-621-633-737-58X; 033-825-085-673-048; 038-565-834-215-129; 043-622-776-825-867; 045-401-332-461-189; 045-433-043-628-866; 045-901-642-811-616; 056-201-471-905-934; 056-806-945-223-786; 059-949-847-321-259; 062-077-633-121-107; 066-328-777-570-12X; 066-725-054-278-474; 072-480-108-191-185; 072-979-551-126-786; 074-556-420-915-484; 079-013-915-313-54X; 080-589-148-600-106; 081-146-598-099-607; 085-516-703-733-958; 090-243-781-440-00X; 100-998-169-249-467; 102-039-675-623-772; 109-724-284-989-697; 110-480-586-717-651; 113-042-758-172-555; 116-608-952-587-083; 118-369-040-452-79X; 121-286-420-647-868; 121-468-243-703-60X; 170-806-424-149-915,4

Davey; Juliet A. Vickery; Nigel Boatman; Dan E. Chamberlain; Hazel R. Parry; Gavin M. Siriwardena,"Agri-environment schemes (AES) are central to the conservation of Europe's farmland biodiversity. The UK Government's Public Service Agreement target seeks to reverse the decline of farmland birds in England by 2020 through the use of AES. The Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) scheme, introduced in 2005, is the first non-competitive, broad-uptake stewardship scheme designed to deliver simple but effective environmental management on farms throughout England. Approximately 5 million hectares of farmland are currently entered into Environmental Stewardship (ES) agreements, and given the scale of this investment it is important to verify the efficacy of ELS as a mechanism for delivering biodiversity benefits. We used spatially referenced ES agreement data to assess the influence of specific management options and combinations of options on farmland bird population changes between 2005 and 2008 derived from standardized surveys carried out on over 2000 lowland farmland 1-km squares in England. The results showed only limited evidence for short-term effects of ES. Only Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra and Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris showed some landscape-specific positive associations with area under ELS management. There was also limited evidence for positive associations between specific management options and the population changes of the species at which they were aimed. The current pattern of option uptake may be limiting benefits of ELS, with boundary management accounting for over 50% of scheme compensation value. However, the time required for option maturation and the time lags in bird population responses to environmental change mean that it is too early to reach definitive conclusions about the success or failure of the scheme. The findings of this study will assist in the development of ELS by feeding into the 5-year review scheduled for 2010 and have implications for the development of similar schemes elsewhere in Europe.",152,3,459,474,Environmental resource management; Geography; Emberiza; Corn bunting; Stewardship; Sturnus; Environmental stewardship; Population; Agricultural land; Environmental protection; Land management,,,,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/2259885 https://iris.unito.it/handle/2318/133701 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Catherine_Tayleur_nee_Davey/publication/229934346_Assessing_the_impact_of_Entry_Level_Stewardship_on_lowland_farmland_birds_in_England/links/00b495284cdbbb3667000000.pdf https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2009.01001.x https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2009.01001.x http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2009.01001.x https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103218329 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2009.01001.x/full,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919x.2009.01001.x,,10.1111/j.1474-919x.2009.01001.x,1585012093,,0,000-366-637-240-527; 000-578-113-641-64X; 002-989-142-190-816; 003-223-037-571-948; 003-460-280-575-85X; 007-194-033-627-161; 007-416-181-403-689; 008-225-619-668-580; 008-463-177-472-452; 010-193-015-913-598; 011-984-573-942-606; 013-709-724-948-295; 014-204-563-886-62X; 014-229-118-471-777; 016-421-756-148-512; 018-028-975-115-624; 021-419-559-384-303; 034-780-355-852-32X; 036-395-833-664-537; 041-704-628-510-931; 043-009-269-441-396; 044-616-246-113-964; 049-557-478-030-177; 049-771-162-087-705; 049-945-615-645-704; 050-261-844-716-21X; 051-685-596-945-405; 052-363-993-930-092; 054-715-078-148-813; 056-099-523-856-735; 058-162-964-253-229; 058-416-961-649-911; 059-502-071-789-055; 060-114-103-966-089; 070-807-130-928-517; 073-990-815-488-726; 074-225-773-604-407; 075-168-083-087-797; 076-278-055-254-459; 077-537-180-667-797; 101-600-744-145-933; 103-004-360-139-077; 103-964-543-837-837; 107-532-685-702-969; 108-367-697-659-208; 113-799-548-008-970; 120-993-169-075-447; 133-858-248-195-498; 150-260-537-510-335; 153-263-834-766-903; 153-520-297-719-363; 155-691-175-864-748; 156-542-248-199-177; 158-551-951-339-01X; 179-402-327-063-059,114

The current investigation assessed the use of the beneficial ascomycete Trichoderma asperellum (Samuels, Lieckf & Nirenberg) and a trap crop of Brassica rapa L. turnip rape cv. “Brachina,” both with and without an application of slurry fertilizer, for pest suppression and yield enhancement of winter oilseed rape cv. “Californium.” The presence of the trap crop significantly increased 1000 grain weight but not total yield or lipid content of the oilseed rape because turnip rape was not attractive enough to prevent colonization of the principal crop. Increase in 1000 grain weight, lipid content, and total seed yield were found in oilseed rape sprayed with three applications of T. asperellum, but the ascomycete had no influence on the insect pests observed.

For all variables measured, significant Site effects were detected. Survival, biomass yield and volume yield were highest at the Bromptonville site. After 6 years of growth, total aboveground biomass production (stems + branches + leaves) reached 112.8 tDM/ha and total leafless biomass production (stems + branches) reached 101.1 tDM/ha at this site, while stem wood volume attained 237.5 m3/ha. Yields as low as 14.2 tDM/ha for total biomass and 24.8 m3/ha for total stem volume were also observed at the Magog site. Highest yields were obtained on the most fertile sites, particularly in terms of NO3 supply rate. Mean stem volume per tree was highly correlated with NO3 supply rate in soils (R2 = 0.58, p < 0.001). Clone effects were also detected for most of the variables measured. Total aboveground biomass and total stem volume production were high for clone 3729 (Populus nigra × P. maximowiczii) (73.1 tDM/ha and 134.2 m3/ha), although not statistically different from clone 915311 (P. maximowiczii × P. balsamifera). However, mean whole-tree biomass (including leaves) was significantly higher for clone 3729 (38.8 kgDM/tree). Multifunctional agroforestry systems such as hybrid poplar riparian buffer strips are among the most sustainable ways to produce a high amount of biomass and wood in a short time period, while contributing to alleviate environmental problems such as agricultural non-point source pollution.",34,7,1028,1040,Riparian zone; Crop yield; Woody plant; Wood production; Riparian buffer; Biomass; Soil fertility; Agroecosystem; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0961953410000772 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103199167 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103199167.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2010.02.011,,10.1016/j.biombioe.2010.02.011,2016834983,,0,000-933-635-218-121; 002-239-487-029-857; 002-937-270-631-538; 003-623-636-254-226; 012-750-229-307-245; 013-863-787-289-173; 016-915-143-213-764; 017-693-761-705-788; 018-253-057-463-110; 018-800-193-760-785; 019-956-026-948-622; 020-759-075-898-281; 029-274-571-592-996; 029-294-447-653-235; 029-590-995-365-695; 031-457-956-437-894; 033-927-204-297-354; 034-438-015-172-199; 035-234-196-977-43X; 038-659-320-814-260; 041-022-665-687-260; 041-967-318-829-765; 042-240-486-460-599; 043-056-074-783-443; 043-449-756-710-740; 043-938-737-678-615; 045-620-679-643-301; 046-822-994-663-953; 052-652-463-976-641; 055-058-441-062-619; 058-071-994-670-88X; 059-500-159-755-598; 062-450-791-591-801; 063-963-834-687-484; 064-748-936-518-619; 065-993-770-255-833; 075-256-709-898-250; 075-347-671-495-176; 075-429-883-991-330; 077-129-148-016-65X; 078-271-809-043-414; 079-196-971-304-319; 081-599-476-955-331; 082-231-990-586-904; 083-700-943-684-566; 084-752-384-287-097; 085-075-946-140-988; 097-171-172-806-015; 101-012-916-569-644; 102-549-288-156-270; 104-377-074-052-075; 114-546-269-929-655; 115-564-502-224-201; 115-687-897-821-704; 116-605-114-400-271; 118-119-615-414-056; 119-789-071-457-523; 122-286-136-513-797; 125-592-936-856-178; 127-023-971-312-961; 127-785-284-544-120; 130-056-387-338-539; 130-875-743-988-538; 139-100-266-704-70X; 141-101-347-131-583; 143-265-843-398-192; 152-333-942-071-521; 159-463-804-489-057; 164-036-494-407-11X; 175-631-856-582-739; 181-395-837-540-571; 181-444-175-324-471; 183-621-826-466-404; 185-093-100-921-013; 186-052-650-558-314; 191-359-559-824-869; 193-348-081-743-291,99

Edwards; Tommy C. Daniel; Philip A. Moore; D. J. Nichols,"Vegetative filter strips (VFS) have been shown to have high potential for reducing nonpoint source pollution from cultivated agricultural source areas, but information from uncultivated source areas amended with poultry litter is limited. Simulated rainfall was used in analyzing effects of VFS length (0, 3.1, 6.1, 9.2, 15.2, and 21.4 m) on quality of runoff from fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) plots (1.5 ¥ 24.4 m) amended with poultry litter (5 Mg/ha). The VFS reduced mass transport of ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ortho-phosphorus (PO4-P), total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total suspended solids (TSS). Mass transport of TKN, NH3-N, TP, and PO4-P were reduced by averages of 39, 47, 40, and 39%, respectively, by 3.1 m VFS and by 81, 98, 91, and 90%, respectively, by 21.4 m VFS. Effectiveness of VFS in terms of mass transport reduction was unchanged, however, beyond 3.1 m length for TSS and COD and averaged 35 and 51%, respectively. The VFS were ineffective in removing nitrate-nitrogen from the incoming runoff. Removal of litter constituents was described very well (r2 = 0.70 to 0.94) by a first-order relationship between constituent removal and VFS length.",38,6,1687,1692,Animal science; Kjeldahl method; Nonpoint source pollution; Chemical oxygen demand; Festuca arundinacea; Poultry litter; Litter; Environmental science; Total suspended solids; Biofilter; Environmental engineering,,,,,http://lshs.tamu.edu/docs/lshs/end-notes/effectiveness%20of%20vegetative%20fi-0222560523/effectiveness%20of%20vegetative%20filter%20strips%20in%20controlling%20losses%20of%20surface-applied%20poultry%20litter%20constituents.pdf https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1069&context=bae_facpub https://uknowledge.uky.edu/bae_facpub/70/ https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Indrajeet_Chaubey/publication/267838933_Effectiveness_of_Vegetative_Filter_Strips_in_Controlling_Losses_of_Surface-Applied_Poultry_Litter_Constituents/links/546cc25b0cf2193b94c5753e.pdf https://elibrary.asabe.org/abstract.asp??JID=3&AID=27995,http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/2013.27995,,10.13031/2013.27995,2036305106,,0,002-773-042-550-754; 004-933-400-226-990; 007-550-413-175-53X; 009-465-809-123-37X; 014-561-967-561-763; 014-870-798-782-547; 027-988-435-399-704; 030-854-075-752-539; 034-748-846-517-673; 055-329-231-017-432; 057-603-249-735-303; 060-888-342-099-719; 066-360-222-781-695; 076-826-572-086-275; 080-349-898-783-287; 086-190-138-130-44X; 087-142-362-977-119; 087-168-688-204-963; 097-054-825-053-530; 118-928-212-112-766; 128-756-255-940-507; 148-021-978-074-372; 169-607-559-923-667; 170-367-686-186-474; 177-770-652-793-529,77

Schultz; J. P. Collettil; Thomas M. Isenhart; William W. Simpkins; Carl W. Mize; Michael L. Thompson,"A multi-species riparian buffer strip (MSRBS) system was designed and placed along a Central Iowa stream in 1990. Bear Creek, is typical of many streams in Central Iowa where the primary land use along the stream's length is row crop (corn and soybeans) production agriculture or intensive riparian zone grazing. The Bear Creek watershed is long (∼ 35 km), narrow (3–6 km), and drains 7,661 ha of farmland. The MSRBS system is a 20 m wide filter strip consisting of four or five rows of fast-growing trees planted closest to the stream, then two shrub rows, and finally a 7 m wide strip of switchgrass established next to the agricultural fields. The 1.0 km long system, is located on an operational farm and is laid out in a split block design on both sides of Bear Creek. An integral part of this system is a streambank stabilization soil bioengineering component and a constructed wetland to intercept NPS pollutants in field drainage tile water flow. It is hypothesized that this system will function effectively as a nutrient, pesticide, and sediment sink for NPS pollutants coming from the upslope agricultural fields. Prior to establishment of the MSRBS system, the riparian zone along Bear Creek was grazed and row cropped to the stream edge. Since 1990 there has been dramatic alteration in the appearance and functioning of this riparian zone. After four growing seasons, the fast-growing tree species (cottonwood, silver maple, willow, and green ash) range in height from 2.4 m to over 5.5 m. Mean (four-year) biomass production of silver maple was 8.4 dry Mg ha−1, more than twice to seven times the yield from other silver maple research plots in Central Iowa. The shrub species, selected because of desired wildlife benefits, have done well in terms of survival and growth with ninebark, Nannyberry viburnum and Nanking cherry doing the best. The switchgrass grass has developed into a dense stand that effectively stops concentrated flow from the agriculture fields and allows for infiltration rates well above the field rate. Early root biomass data indicate significantly more roots below the MSRBS than agricultural fields. This suggests better soil stabilization, absorption of infiltrated water, and soil-root-microbe-NPS pollutant interaction characteristics within the MSRBS system than the cropped fields. Nitrate-nitrogen concentrations in the MSRBS never exceed 2 mg l−1 whereas the levels in the adjacent agricultural fields exceed 12 mg l−1. The water quality data collected suggest that the MSRBS is effective in reducing NPS pollutants in the vadose and saturated zone below the system. The soil bioengineering revetments have stabilized the streambank and minimized bank collapse. Initial results (from 4 months of operation) from the constructed wetland (built in summer 1994) indicate nitrate-nitrogen concentrations of the tile inflow water >15 mg l−1 whereas, the outflow water had a nitrate-nitrogen concentration of <3 mg l−1. Over time this wetland should become more effective in removing excess nitrogen moving with the tile flow from the agricultural fields because of the accumulation of organic matter from the cattails. Overall the MSRBS system seems to be functioning as expected. This MSRBS system offers farmers a way to intercept eroding soil, trap and transform NPS pollution, stabilize streambanks, provide wildlife habitat, produce biomass for on-farm use, produce high-quality hardwood in the future, and enhance the aesthetics of the agroecosystem. As a streamside best management practice (BMP), the MSRBS system complements upland BMPs and provides many valuable private and public market and non-market benefits.",29,3,201,226,Riparian zone; Riparian buffer; Soil bioengineering; Filter strip; Erosion control; Pollutant interaction; Silver maple; Water flow; Hydrology; Environmental science; Agroforestry,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19950612959.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00704869 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19950612959,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00704869,,10.1007/bf00704869,2012263050,,0,003-533-399-894-449; 015-514-563-181-208; 021-035-599-514-122; 022-216-181-106-913; 029-274-571-592-996; 034-748-846-517-673; 038-659-320-814-260; 040-806-887-128-56X; 041-983-906-982-299; 045-573-628-287-109; 047-315-074-139-26X; 047-760-535-059-699; 051-081-779-139-353; 054-216-221-470-017; 056-518-814-650-546; 065-821-895-518-368; 066-567-733-926-583; 068-103-192-817-030; 079-789-931-625-023; 080-589-148-600-106; 083-258-693-486-102; 087-138-533-405-771; 097-171-172-806-015; 097-972-089-803-438; 100-760-152-620-952; 111-435-647-398-863; 111-564-487-710-889; 141-101-347-131-583; 176-609-653-505-894; 180-028-828-823-122; 190-787-877-708-569,201

Yahner,"Seasonal dynamics and habitat relationships of avian populations and communities in farmstead shelterbelts were studied during 1978-80 in southern Minnesota. Eighty-seven species of birds were recorded, 14 of which were classified as being highly important; omnivores and granivores were predominant. Species richness (S) and species diversity (H') were similar in spring and summer, but were lower in autumn and winter. Species evenness (J') seldom varied among seasons, and no consistent pattern in total individuals of all species combined (N) occurred over seasons. Shelterbelts were segregated into 3 types based primarily on stability of S, J', and N during autumn and winter. Extent of perimeter and length of shelterbelts were associated more often with avian variables than was area of shelterbelts. Distance to wooded and oldfield habitats, distance to and number of proximal buildings, and percentage of croplands and pastures surrounding shelterbelts were important to associated avifauna. A concentration effect occurred in isolated shelterbelts; the greater the isolation, the more likely that certain species were encountered in a shelterbelt due to the paucity of similar habitat in the vicinity. Picea, Pinus, Populus, Ulmus, Acer, Fraxinus, and Lonicera were related to abundances of several avian species. Management recommendations include establishing shelterbelts that are >0.6 ha in area and 8 rows in width. Proper spacing within and between rows should be considered and a diversity of plantings should be used. Mowing and cultivation should be discontinued after the shelterbelt becomes established. Snags should be retained as nesting and foraging sites. Croplands, rather than pastures, should be positioned near shelterbelts. No-tillage or minimum tillage systems, a few rows of standing crops, food plots, and artificial feeders at farm homes are suggested. Shelterbelts can be designed to provide protection and beauty to the farmstead aswell as to benefit a variety of farmland avifauna. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 47(1):85-104 Farmstead shelterbelts are man-made habitats created by planting rows of trees and shrubs (hereafter also termed plantings) on the windward sides of farm homes and buildings. In intensively farmed regions of the Midwest, these small wooded ""islands"" (generally <1 ha) provide protection against wind and drifting snow, reduce energy and feed costs, and afford aesthetic beauty to farmsteads (Smith and Scholten 1980). Further, shelterbelts are of considerable importance to birds and other wildlife (Popowski 1976, Martin 1978). However, as a result of larger farms, increased mechanization, use of pivot irrigation systems, and other recent trends in the agricultural industry, the availability of farmstead shelterbelts and other permanent wildlife habitat is restricted (Vance 1976). For example, Griffith (1976) estimated that farmstead shelterbelts, field windbreaks, and other wooded habitats comprise <3% of the total area in the Great Plains. Aspects of the ecology of avifauna associated with farmstead shelterbelts have been examined. Rotzien (1963) and Yahner (1981) studied winter use of shelterbelts by birds. Weiser and Hlavinka (1956), Martin (1978, 1980), Martin and Vohs (1978), and Cassel and Wiehe (1980) investigated breeding and migratory communities in these habitats. Avian use of vertical strata and plantings during the annual cycle has been detailed (Yahner 1981b). Nest densities and nest-site selection also have been examined (Field 1971, Martin 1978, Yahner 1982a).

The objectives of my study were to (1) document seasonal trends in the dynamics of avian populations and community structure in farmstead shelterbelts, (2) examine the relationships between the habitat features describing dimensions, vegetation, and proximal land-uses of shelterbelts and the avian populations and communities using these habitats, and (3) develop effective management recommendations for landowners and agencies that either establish new or renovate older shelterbelts.

Feber; Mark S. Parsons; Nigel A. D. Bourn; Martin C. Townsend; Philip Riordan; David W. Macdonald,"General agri-environment schemes (AES) have been shown to benefit widespread species, but there is little information on the extent to which rare, more localised, species may also benefit. We tested whether AES options aimed at increasing general biodiversity also benefit a highly endangered moth, Polia;  bombycina, without species-specific tailoring. We assessed effects on its abundance of two AES options, wide field margins and hedgerow trees, using light traps at the landscape-scale and for mark-release-recapture at the farm-scale. We hypothesized that abundance would be highest at wide field margins and at hedgerow trees, and that if hedgerow trees conferred a positive effect, individuals would be more likely to follow hedgerows than crossing exposed fields while on the move. The results showed that significantly more individuals were captured at sites with a hedgerow tree. Numbers were also higher at wide margins, but this was not statistically significant, and no individuals were caught at field centres. Our study suggests that general options within appropriately designed and implemented AES aimed at increasing overall biodiversity in intensive agricultural landscapes have the potential to not only benefit common, widespread habitat generalists, but some rare and more endangered species as well. P. bombycina serves as an example of how general AES options, existing and novel ones alike, might cater for the needs of rare and localised species. As the precise ecological requirements of most invertebrate species remain unknown, we urge scientists and governments to address the challenge to research and design truly general AES, which options should be able to deliver not only for widespread species but also for the less-widespread counterpart of farmland biodiversity.",14,5,499,510,Biodiversity; Agricultural biodiversity; Endangered species; Habitat; Ecology; Animal ecology; Generalist and specialist species; Agroforestry; Abundance (ecology); Biology; Landscape ecology,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10841-010-9279-1/fulltext.html https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103316281 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103316281.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10841-010-9279-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-010-9279-1,,10.1007/s10841-010-9279-1,1989748083,,0,000-578-113-641-64X; 001-779-725-156-319; 003-460-280-575-85X; 008-225-619-668-580; 009-104-527-591-059; 009-567-767-185-587; 013-146-093-850-278; 013-972-487-257-260; 014-204-563-886-62X; 015-101-586-632-782; 016-421-756-148-512; 017-708-454-247-712; 019-477-821-561-55X; 024-924-476-251-122; 025-983-895-963-761; 026-556-034-565-411; 026-939-530-728-038; 027-401-790-771-472; 028-942-092-865-568; 030-285-119-895-818; 031-094-771-196-289; 033-591-414-595-185; 035-640-382-400-187; 038-618-402-954-434; 043-213-251-246-857; 044-445-829-636-966; 045-640-805-432-475; 046-500-604-745-231; 049-346-208-924-920; 050-261-844-716-21X; 050-580-947-928-66X; 050-907-802-597-89X; 052-951-584-268-481; 053-990-573-022-046; 056-099-523-856-735; 056-244-188-471-763; 056-262-796-957-686; 056-383-727-358-744; 057-941-074-733-032; 057-955-497-591-23X; 058-416-961-649-911; 058-479-800-510-95X; 059-502-071-789-055; 059-931-988-405-469; 060-114-103-966-089; 060-190-757-297-843; 062-501-527-775-318; 070-025-804-791-515; 076-307-235-228-944; 077-537-180-667-797; 080-390-014-852-73X; 084-744-111-694-770; 085-191-531-494-467; 085-507-496-811-84X; 093-861-925-204-733; 098-312-271-690-700; 100-434-214-304-469; 101-624-055-101-229; 101-848-247-761-283; 108-169-857-391-259; 112-921-663-214-403; 113-125-915-928-138; 114-480-653-531-829; 115-606-139-771-296; 121-009-467-056-402; 121-945-778-163-805; 122-021-342-537-614; 123-544-334-375-765; 124-407-129-963-803; 129-005-638-846-365; 133-858-248-195-498; 136-120-101-903-89X; 137-360-755-261-936; 137-787-371-305-197; 137-802-632-043-010; 139-032-491-419-065; 140-373-290-241-230; 141-005-140-982-524; 146-382-118-408-345; 146-451-983-501-815; 150-260-537-510-335; 151-519-394-813-414; 160-262-819-354-643; 166-276-470-193-351; 166-826-142-461-007; 169-297-520-424-667; 171-352-683-438-394; 171-541-311-115-415; 176-596-394-799-241; 180-871-653-314-885; 185-814-226-630-227; 194-464-477-426-158; 196-055-283-430-947,25

Anderson; Clark J. Gantzer; E. E. Alberts,"The effectiveness of stiff-stemmed grass hedge systems in controlling runoff and soil erosion is influenced by the water transport properties of the soil under grass hedge management. This study evaluated soil hydraulic properties within a grass hedge system 10 yr after establishment. The study was conducted at the USDA-ARS research station near Treynor, IA in a field managed with switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) hedges. The soil was classified as Monona silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls). Three positions were sampled: within the grass hedges, within the deposition zone 0.5 m upslope from the grass hedges, and within the row crop area 7 m upslope from the hedges. Intact soil samples (76 by 76 mm) were taken from the three positions at four depths (100-mm increments) to determine saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (K sat ), bulk density (ρ b ), and soil water retention. The grass hedge position had significantly greater (P < 0.05) macroporosity than the row crop and deposition positions in the first two depths and greater than the deposition position in the last two depths. The K sat within the grass hedge (668 mm h -1 ) was six times greater than in the row crop position (115 mm h -1 ) and 18 times greater than in the deposition position (37 mm h -1 ) for the surface 10 cm. Bulk density and macroporosity were found to provide the best two-parameter regression model for predicting the log-transformed K sat (R 2 = 0.68).

Aims To assess the potential of FBEGS to evaluate the ecological quality of field boundaries in agricultural ecosystems and as a tool for the measurement of bird populations within field boundaries. Methods Surveys of bird populations were made in selected field boundaries on 50 farms in southeast Ireland in winter and during the breeding season. FBEGS surveys were also carried out on field boundaries to assess ecological quality. glms were fitted to assess the utility of the FBEGS Index as a predictor of bird populations. Results The FBEGS Index was an effective predictor of bird populations in the breeding season, but had limited use in predicting bird populations in winter. Within the overall FBEGS Index, the Associated Features score was a good predictor for populations in both the winter and breeding seasons.

003-460-280-575-85X,Comparing the efficacy of agri-environment schemes to enhance bumble bee abundance and diversity on arable field margins,2006-11-29,2006,journal article,Journal of Applied Ecology,00218901; 13652664,Wiley,United Kingdom,Claire Carvell; W. R. Meek; Richard F. Pywell; Dave Goulson; Marek Nowakowski,"1. Declines in abundance and diversity of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) in Europe have been linked to agricultural intensification and the resulting loss of suitable foraging and nesting habitats. Environmental Stewardship (ES) is a new scheme in England offering the opportunity to restore habitats of value for these important pollinators to agricultural land. Scientific evaluation of the options prescribed within the scheme is essential to ensure that their objectives are met and that the benefits can be realized by the full bumble bee species assemblage. 2. We compared the efficacy of different ES options for field margins on arable land in enhancing the abundance and diversity of flowering resources and foraging bumble bees. Our study was conducted over 3 years using a multisite experiment. 3. Overall, uncropped margins sown with mixtures containing nectar and pollen-producing plants were more effective in providing bumble bee forage than margins sown with a grass mix, allowed to regenerate naturally or managed as conservation headlands. 4. A mixture of agricultural legumes established quickly and attracted on average the highest total abundance and diversity of bumble bees, including the rare long-tongued species Bombus ruderatus and Bombus muscorum. However, marked differences were observed between species and sexes in their responses to field margin management over time. 5. A diverse mixture of native wildflowers attracted more of the shorter-tongued Bombus spp. and provided greater continuity of forage resources, especially early in the season. Allowing Cirsium spp. to flower on such margins also increased their attractiveness to male bumble bees. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the legume-based 'pollen and nectar flower mix', as prescribed under Entry Level Stewardship in England, can quickly provide a highly attractive forage resource for bumble bees, but that issues of seasonal flowering phenology and longevity of the mixture need to be addressed. Establishment of 'floristically enhanced margins' under Higher Level Stewardship will be important to provide diverse perennial communities of forage plants and to support a greater range of Bombus spp. and other pollinators. The population-level responses of bumble bees to introduced seed mixtures and other agri-environment options require further study in order to maximize the benefits of such schemes in intensively farmed landscapes. © 2006 The Authors.",44,1,29,40,Pollinator; Forage (honey bee); Nectar; Foraging; Ecology; Apidae; Bombus muscorum; Bombus ruderatus; Bombus terrestris; Biology,,,,,https://www.scilit.net/article/e1b2a27ae1d4bc5f63bb8bb7e4d2bf88 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01249.x/abstract https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01249.x http://dspace.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/7198 https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01249.x https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01249.x http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/51218/ https://www.jstor.org/stable/4123822 https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND43865820,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01249.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01249.x,1823837557,,0,000-925-852-080-712; 004-468-911-725-66X; 005-168-109-694-810; 008-225-619-668-580; 009-012-164-159-153; 012-267-243-122-028; 014-229-118-471-777; 016-421-756-148-512; 017-948-698-985-888; 018-028-975-115-624; 018-442-796-237-224; 020-074-979-227-411; 021-657-818-388-442; 025-983-895-963-761; 027-159-836-996-448; 028-836-626-480-197; 029-264-530-643-997; 030-453-266-652-445; 031-862-039-493-29X; 035-775-229-294-961; 035-993-763-187-90X; 038-844-627-956-858; 039-885-186-600-094; 046-004-550-166-441; 048-543-721-099-075; 049-088-413-362-630; 052-425-505-697-799; 056-391-120-745-502; 056-585-869-238-25X; 056-789-845-462-569; 064-975-099-130-640; 067-912-727-549-225; 068-452-604-669-157; 074-793-529-288-006; 076-609-834-637-348; 077-563-394-178-760; 077-623-747-437-53X; 079-068-774-342-74X; 080-164-660-083-693; 081-749-104-701-059; 083-810-224-480-214; 092-538-659-846-218; 112-917-317-852-89X; 114-016-061-618-278; 114-480-653-531-829; 117-345-687-903-78X; 154-386-144-197-99X; 156-207-702-434-918; 165-420-840-117-725; 168-312-770-361-773; 184-899-964-527-087; 185-374-982-166-638,335

Communities of spiders, ground beetles, true bugs and aphids were sampled in 2years along transects from the centre of organically managed cereal fields into adjacent grassy margins. Based on species richness, abundances, ecological and body size traits of species and taxonomic distinctness between species, communities were compared between organically managed cereal fields and their grassy margins. The species richness, abundance and variation in taxonomic distinctness of true bugs were significantly higher in grassy margins. For spiders and ground beetles, these metrics were either higher in cereal fields or did not differ significantly. At the species level, spiders living under stones or in soil crevices, as well as phytophagous ground beetles and true bugs that overwinter as eggs benefited from grassy margins. True bug communities in cereal fields were dominated by a few abundant species, whereas communities in margins were rather dominated by a few large species. Our comprehensive analyses highlight the importance of accounting for species identities and biology in biodiversity studies. The traits that characterised arthropod species that benefited from margins are not characteristic for pest species. Grassy margins along organic fields therefore represent an important agri-environmental scheme for the conservation of several arthropod taxa and margins should not be removed to increase the crop production area in organically managed cereal fields.

Zaimes; Richard C. Schultz,"Well-established perennial vegetation in riparian areas of agricultural lands can stabilize the end points of gullies and reduce their overall erosion. The objective of this study was to investigate the impacts of riparian land management on gully erosion. A field survey documented the number of gullies and cattle access points in riparian forest buffers, grass filters, annual row-cropped fields, pastures in which the cattle were fenced out of the stream, and continuously, rotationally and intensive rotationally grazed pastures in three regions of Iowa. Gully lengths, depths and severely eroding bank areas were measured. Gullies exhibited few significant differences among riparian management practices. The most significant differences were exhibited between conservation and agricultural management practices, an indication that conservation practices could reduce gully erosion. Changes in pasture management from continuous to rotational or intensive rotational grazing showed no reductions in gully erosion. It is important to recognize that more significant differences among riparian management practices were not exhibited because the conservation and alternative grazing practices had recently been established. As gully formation is more impacted by upland than riparian management, gully stabilization might require additional upland conservation practices. The existence of numerous cattle access points in pastures where cattle have full access to the stream also indicates that these could be substantial sources of sediment for streams. Finally, the gully banks were less important sediment contributors to streams than the streambanks. The severely eroding bank areas in streams were six times greater than those in the gullies in the monitored reaches.",49,5,1009,1021,Riparian zone; Erosion; Riparian forest; Vegetation; Grazing; Forest management; Hydrology; Environmental science; STREAMS; Agroforestry; Land management,,Agriculture/methods; Animal Husbandry/methods; Animals; Cattle; Conservation of Natural Resources/methods; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Geographic Information Systems; Herbivory; Iowa; Soil/standards; Water Movements,Soil,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22419397 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00267-012-9830-9 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00267-012-9830-9 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/587041 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012EnMan..49.1009Z/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-012-9830-9,22419397,10.1007/s00267-012-9830-9,1980625442,,0,007-868-997-910-082; 016-117-860-166-511; 024-094-631-600-899; 029-250-676-239-025; 030-930-616-665-449; 033-106-156-824-421; 033-488-338-717-64X; 037-490-459-803-77X; 038-335-400-539-341; 040-346-920-371-461; 045-814-903-083-739; 049-317-197-739-54X; 051-921-106-618-48X; 075-466-194-820-598; 083-619-701-060-090; 084-230-744-739-432; 091-412-899-539-225; 097-728-085-931-913; 106-730-563-709-055; 107-605-939-075-788; 109-858-282-831-697; 118-507-802-614-015; 132-380-946-851-855; 133-652-315-317-982; 136-648-532-702-104; 141-890-584-919-504; 144-712-509-851-543; 146-619-043-517-661,11

Clews; Ian P. Vaughan; Stephen James Ormerod,"1. The restoration of degraded riparian zones to improve a range of functions is attracting increasing interest, but there are still questions about (i) how effectively restoration changes riparian or channel conditions; (ii) whether riparian management offsets the effects of wider catchment pressures; and (iii) whether these effects can be detected quantitatively. 2. A catchment-scale experiment was used to assess the effects of riparian restoration on riparian and channel conditions in the Welsh River Wye. In a hierarchically designed survey, variations in river habitat character were assessed among tributaries where riparian zones were recently managed for restoration (n = 9 streams), unmanaged controls (n = 12), intensively grazed pastures (n = 3) and coniferous plantation (n = 3). Management between 1997 and 2003, largely involving coppicing, was designed to exclude grazing through fencing in order to enable vegetation development while creating salmonid refuges. River habitat character was assessed using the UK 'River Habitat Survey' (RHS) method, with habitat variation quantified using Principal Components Analysis. 3. Stream habitats varied significantly among treatment categories. Streams draining plantation conifer had 'harder' channel features, while those draining intensively grazed pasture were characterized by finer substrata and more active channels than elsewhere. Riparian management reduced livestock trampling ( = poaching) and increased algal cover relative to controls. Coppicing and riparian fencing successfully excluded grazing on banks while increasing, in-stream vegetation cover, but did not affect substrata, flow-types and channel features. 4. These data show that RHS can detect habitat variation among streams in contrasting riparian land-use, revealing some apparently significant effects of recent restoration. We advocate longer-term investigations at reach to catchment scales to assess longer-term effects on channel and flow character, and to appraise fully the extent to which local riparian management can offset impairments at a catchment or larger scale, such as altered run-off regimes, sediment delivery and climate change.

Fox; David B. Orr; Yasmin J. Cardoza,"Habitat manipulations, intentional provisioning of natural vegetation along crop edges, have been shown to enhance beneficial epigaeic invertebrate activity in many agricultural settings, but little research has been conducted on this practice in the southeast United States. We conducted a field-scale study to determine if habitat manipulations along the field edges of an organic crop rotation increase the activity-density of beneficial ground-dwelling invertebrates. Pitfall traps were used to collect micro and macro ground-dwelling organisms in nine organic crop fields (three each of maize, soybeans, and hay; 2.5-4.0 ha each) surrounded by four experimental habitat manipulations (planted native grass and prairie flowers, planted prairie flowers only, fallow vegetation, or mowed vegetation) during 2009 and 2010 in eastern North Carolina. Beneficial macro and micro invertebrates collected in these pitfall traps consisted primarily of Carabidae, Araneae, Collembola, and mite species. Results show that habitat manipulations had little effect on the activity-density of the dominant epigaeic invertebrates in our study system. Our results suggest that the activity-density of these organisms were instead determined by a combination of in-field characteristics, such as crop type, weed management practices, and within-field resources, along with the diversity of crop type in neighboring fields and the availability of other resources in the area.",44,1,114,121,Ecosystem; Biodiversity; Crop; Weed control; Vegetation; Crop rotation; Habitat; Ecology; Cropping system; Agronomy; Biology,Amara cupreolata; Araneae; Collembola; Megacephala carolina; habitat manipulation,"Agriculture/methods; Animals; Arthropods; Biodiversity; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; North Carolina; Population Density",,,http://academic.oup.com/ee/article-abstract/44/1/114/2464597 https://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1093/ee/nvu002 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26308813 https://bioone.org/journals/Environmental-Entomology/volume-44/issue-1/nvu002/The-Influence-of-Habitat-Manipulations-on-Beneficial-Ground-Dwelling-Arthropods/10.1093/ee/nvu002.full https://europepmc.org/article/MED/26308813 https://academic.oup.com/ee/article-abstract/44/1/114/2464597,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvu002,26308813,10.1093/ee/nvu002,2134370080,,0,000-573-928-813-606; 003-615-402-143-566; 004-464-943-070-479; 005-508-343-969-868; 009-172-624-760-904; 010-472-819-956-683; 012-986-196-369-028; 014-571-735-949-397; 017-516-181-294-137; 018-177-593-857-47X; 022-070-333-305-083; 025-236-956-549-929; 027-591-409-062-387; 028-748-785-740-507; 029-222-150-266-450; 032-202-649-547-585; 033-480-195-653-709; 036-341-669-064-826; 036-573-126-228-516; 037-084-389-670-33X; 042-303-914-852-499; 042-904-615-319-356; 047-588-514-493-494; 053-548-832-412-849; 056-892-630-404-500; 057-186-934-575-091; 060-997-589-015-33X; 061-714-212-871-260; 066-768-162-003-70X; 071-511-859-224-147; 073-103-720-677-168; 073-291-161-040-734; 074-504-972-959-800; 076-074-987-039-623; 084-611-958-987-326; 085-035-570-679-857; 087-186-786-234-321; 089-569-101-533-021; 097-891-727-359-251; 100-038-531-979-078; 114-443-037-294-791; 117-493-241-761-064; 129-459-070-757-621; 129-485-035-717-367; 134-921-760-522-115; 151-370-073-476-020; 164-060-135-235-870; 189-705-231-003-183,6

In this study, we analyzed the effects of wildflower strips (WFS) at the field scale and in the landscape context on butterflies in a Swiss arable landscape. Three hypotheses were tested: (1) butterfly diversity and abundance are higher in WFS than in conventional fields; (2) butterfly diversity and abundance are enhanced by the amount, proximity and connectivity of WFS in the landscape context; (3) additional factors influence butterfly diversity and abundance according to individual site conditions and landscape context characteristics linked to other landscape elements. WFS had more species and individuals of butterflies than conventional habitats. However, promoted species were mainly generalists; few specialists were enhanced. The diversity of all butterflies and of generalists increased linearly with percent cover of WFS, reflecting an effect of restoration measures depending on the landscape context. The influence of proximity and connectivity of WFS were, however, not significant. The occurrence of specialists was conditioned by plant species richness, while the effect of WFS for overall diversity was affected by the amount of grassland in the surroundings. We conclude that to increase the effectiveness of biodiversity-orientated restoration measures, their implementation should be steered toward increasing the share of WFS in the landscape. However, the combination of WFS with additional restoration measures might be needed to halt the decline of specialist species.",19,4,500,508,Biodiversity; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Butterfly; Context (language use); Generalist and specialist species; Species richness; Abundance (ecology); Restoration ecology,,,,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2010.00649.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2010.00649.x/full https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2010.00649.x https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01458621 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2010.00649.x/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100x.2010.00649.x,,10.1111/j.1526-100x.2010.00649.x,2055349214,,0,000-484-826-607-866; 008-291-852-239-016; 008-630-909-317-753; 011-886-495-134-718; 011-919-119-768-782; 012-267-243-122-028; 014-204-563-886-62X; 014-229-118-471-777; 014-958-779-249-778; 016-421-756-148-512; 016-668-772-079-670; 017-786-901-727-296; 018-028-975-115-624; 019-355-665-347-475; 029-681-801-489-918; 031-216-949-664-784; 033-248-413-039-314; 033-591-414-595-185; 037-002-778-558-737; 037-883-795-788-801; 040-449-873-182-757; 045-077-143-858-513; 045-755-184-521-36X; 053-505-331-627-489; 055-518-211-938-261; 056-099-523-856-735; 056-822-231-800-190; 064-663-934-740-977; 066-376-824-715-720; 070-194-102-378-889; 070-582-747-582-275; 073-256-571-154-968; 076-163-499-540-034; 077-063-381-537-524; 081-749-104-701-059; 082-389-624-773-160; 087-779-919-702-867; 088-723-274-295-38X; 097-704-581-760-870; 098-312-271-690-700; 101-226-492-644-199; 105-301-641-863-030; 112-555-338-163-73X; 115-161-489-792-477; 115-507-657-132-984; 133-272-860-021-373; 134-910-223-418-626; 142-624-071-999-929,43

Anderson; L.G. Bricknell; Ranjith P. Udawatta; Clark J. Gantzer,"Agroforestry buffers have been introduced in temperate areas to improve water quality and diversity farm income. The objective of tins study was to evaluate saturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention for soils managed under rotationally grazed (RG) pasture, continuously grazed (CG) pasture, grass buffers (GB), and agroforestry buffers (AgB). Pasture and GB areas included red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) and lespedeza (Kummerowia stipulacea Maxim.) planted into fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb..) while AgB included Eastern cottonwood trees (Populus deltoids Bortr. ex Marsh.) planted into fescue. Water retention data were measured at -0.4, -1.0, -2.5, -5.0, -10, -20, and -30 kPa (-0.058, -0.145, -0.363, -0.725, -1.45, -2.90, -4.35 pounds per square inch [psi]) soil water pressures using 76 mm (3.00 in) diameter by 76 mm long cores from the 0 to 10 cm, 10 to 20 cm, 20 to 30 cm, and 30 to 40 cm (0 to 3.94 in 3.94 to 7.87 in, 7.87 to 11.81 in, and 11.81 to 15.75 in) depths. Soil bulk density was 12.6% higher for the RG and CG treatments (1.41 and 1.45 g cm 3 (88.02 and 90.52 lb ft -3 ]) than the GB and Agl3 treatments (1.25 and 1.29 g cm -3 |78.03 and 80.53 1b fr -3 ). Soil water content at high soil water potentials (0 and -0.4 kPa) was greater in the buffer treatments relative to the other treatments for the 0 to 10 cm soil depth. Soil macroporosity (>1,000 μm [>0.0394 in] diameter) was 5.7, 4.5, and 3.9 times higher, respectively, for the AgB, GB, and RG treatments compared to the CG treatment for the 0 to 10 cm soil depth. Butter treatments had greater macroporosity (>1,000 μm diameter), coarse (60 to 1,000 μm [0.00236 to 0.0394 in] diameter) and fine mesoporosity (10 to 60 μm [0.000394 to 0.00236 in] diameter), but lower microporosity (< 10 μm Still diameter) compared to RG and CG treatments. Saturated hydraulic conductivity values for GB and AgB treatments were 16.7 times higher (56.95 vs.61.33 mm h -1 [2.24 vs. 2.41 in hr -1 ]) compared with RG and CG (3.98 vs. 3.11 mm h -1 [0.157 vs. 0.122 in hr -1 ]).This study illustrates that agroforestry and grass buffers maintained higher values for soil hydraulic properties compared to grazed pasture systems.",63,4,224,232,Soil water; Chemistry; Festuca arundinacea; Pasture; Lespedeza; Kummerowia stipulacea; Eastern Cottonwood; Agroforestry; Hydraulic conductivity; Bulk density,,,,,http://www.jswconline.org/content/63/4/224.refs https://www.jswconline.org/content/63/4/224,http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.63.4.224,,10.2489/jswc.63.4.224,2010099012,,0,000-507-453-793-713; 003-232-594-172-08X; 003-978-294-004-43X; 003-987-711-192-684; 005-489-558-984-378; 005-742-835-423-082; 008-380-052-396-94X; 011-967-392-229-938; 019-622-915-734-27X; 022-449-873-473-500; 033-392-914-830-346; 033-890-182-096-159; 036-466-585-417-013; 055-486-051-386-205; 055-792-532-072-966; 057-155-441-521-798; 062-143-711-138-127; 066-766-200-834-012; 068-021-380-844-352; 075-047-231-918-142; 082-935-491-133-244; 088-017-310-971-747; 094-386-783-945-275; 095-312-534-361-222; 099-557-323-847-418; 100-679-216-297-456; 111-984-597-164-250; 142-222-273-208-839; 150-117-449-077-365; 162-161-076-488-826; 165-388-551-938-802; 169-090-819-139-141; 180-107-122-045-678; 197-981-050-609-400,40

However, apart from buffer strip widths, further characteristics such as vegetation density or the presence of erosion rills are generally neglected in the determination of buffer strip mitigation efficacies. This study conducted a field survey of fruit orchards (average slope 3.1-12.2%) of the Lourens River catchment, South Africa, which specifically focused on the characteristics and attributes of buffer strips separating orchard areas from tributary streams. In addition, in-stream and erosion rill water samples were collected during three runoff events and GIS-based modeling was employed to predict losses of pesticides associated with runoff. The results show that erosion rills are common in buffer strips (on average 13 to 24 m wide) of the tributaries (up to 6.5 erosion rills per km flow length) and that erosion rills represent concentrated entry pathways of pesticide runoff into the tributaries during rainfall events. Exposure modeling shows that measured pesticide surface water concentrations correlated significantly (R(2)=0.626; p<0.001) with runoff losses predicted by the modeling approach in which buffer strip width was set to zero at sites with erosion rills; in contrast, no relationship between predicted runoff losses and in-stream pesticide concentrations were detected in the modeling approach that neglected erosion rills and thus assumed efficient buffer strips. Overall, the results of our study show that erosion rills may substantially reduce buffer strip pesticide retention efficacies during runoff events and suggest that the capability of buffer strips as a risk mitigation tool for runoff is largely overestimated in current regulatory risk assessment procedures conducted for pesticide authorization.",545-546,,171,183,,Exposure modeling; Field survey; Monitoring; Risk assessment; Runoff; South Africa,"Agriculture; Environmental Restoration and Remediation/methods; Geological Phenomena; Pesticides/analysis; Rivers; South Africa; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis; Water Pollution, Chemical/prevention & control","Pesticides; Water Pollutants, Chemical",National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF),,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.12.077,26745303,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.12.077,,,0,001-021-964-543-19X; 001-836-756-599-946; 002-948-953-603-150; 007-558-420-880-022; 011-210-426-196-245; 015-339-877-852-566; 019-057-578-554-139; 021-655-763-861-159; 021-869-493-155-302; 023-593-689-053-656; 026-689-206-139-259; 027-138-332-330-092; 029-942-152-064-76X; 032-809-616-309-952; 035-815-657-151-928; 043-320-672-388-224; 043-589-082-589-562; 046-626-408-470-449; 055-928-057-358-040; 058-541-759-409-044; 068-933-096-514-243; 081-700-836-157-645; 087-680-309-241-290; 092-770-635-340-892; 097-986-438-425-365; 101-087-831-253-364; 111-288-588-656-115; 114-040-630-292-408; 132-101-636-585-761; 138-643-821-809-522; 163-440-025-402-955,12

Surface runoff and sediment from the watershed and each plot were collected and measured during 2004–2007. Field investigations indicated that hedgerows were the best for soil erosion control, followed by stone dike terraces and soil dike terraces. The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model was used to simulate erosion of annual and rainfall events both at the watershed and plot levels. The low deviation, high coefficient of determination and model efficiency values for the simulations indicated that the WEPP model was a suitable model. The soil erosion rate distribution was modeled to determine where serious erosion would occur during rainfall events in the Zhangjiachong Watershed and so control measures can be taken.",81,2,104,112,Soil conservation; Erosion; WEPP; Watershed; Erosion control; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Dike,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0341816210000196 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103146277.html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0341816210000196 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103146277,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2010.01.009,,10.1016/j.catena.2010.01.009,2007526772,,0,000-999-018-033-721; 001-385-295-656-548; 004-048-825-995-697; 005-104-304-059-190; 005-629-912-629-750; 006-121-921-877-333; 010-936-384-589-791; 011-930-206-189-014; 012-014-128-247-508; 015-386-837-756-635; 016-557-433-537-823; 020-170-026-381-559; 020-407-487-802-291; 025-927-902-967-968; 029-639-639-930-517; 031-181-706-386-110; 032-350-303-292-794; 035-742-580-455-08X; 036-010-921-355-128; 042-338-638-247-830; 043-970-481-061-207; 049-164-050-820-568; 050-927-093-073-142; 058-204-147-394-892; 060-486-678-773-71X; 062-385-083-891-266; 066-683-381-996-673; 066-947-210-171-825; 066-953-416-765-777; 069-444-492-134-17X; 085-852-485-673-629; 086-445-876-921-229; 094-218-024-051-999; 094-409-159-402-25X; 097-405-696-082-811; 097-693-952-456-501; 102-095-790-972-376; 102-832-625-892-986; 109-289-513-303-895; 109-933-884-340-200; 112-627-781-965-155; 122-456-089-524-31X; 126-891-362-979-107; 129-370-722-721-827; 133-735-878-400-775; 137-800-249-485-773; 150-366-901-304-868; 163-771-023-724-981; 176-743-329-100-382; 180-528-588-043-565; 188-582-932-526-039,51

As the core water region for the ""South-to-North Water Transfer Project"", certain measures should be implemented to ensure the safe of water quality. In consideration of the poor socioeconomic position of local farmers, the application of the low cost contour hedgerows had been an important measure of the utilization and conservation of slope land. However, there is a lack of information on different contour hedgerows on control of nutrient, soil and water loss in Danjiangkou Reservoir region. Based on the wheat-maize rotation pattern, a runoff experiment was conducted on a sloping land with a gradient of 14° to investigate the impact of different contour hedgerows on control of nutrient, soil and water loss on sloping land in Danjiangkou Reservoir region. Results showed that hedgerows could notably reduce soil erosion and runoff soon after their establishment, the Lonicera japonica Thunb. hedgerow showed the best effect on it. All of the four tested hedgerows could reduce slope gradient in a certain extent, while Lonicera japonica Thunb. hedgerow exhibited the most obvious effect on it. Hedgerow treatments could effectively reduce soil nutrient loss.

Windbreaks decrease wind speed, reducing damage to the crop and improving yield and quality. Sheltering may improve microclimate conditions for plant growth and protects the soil from wind erosion. Aspects of the sheltering ability of four different windbreaks have been tested: single and double row herbaceous (Tritio secale) shelterbelts, and two different artificial wooden fences, with the same overall average porosity, but with different porosity distributions. Mean velocity, turbulence intensity, skewness distributions and spectral and wavelet analysis have been performed in order to characterise the turbulent flow downstream of the different windbreaks. Wheat grain yield and harvest index were compared with adjacent unsheltered plantations. The single and double row shelterbelts enhanced the grain yield and the harvest index of the protected plants. An influence of the turbulent structure on plant growth is suggested by the different response of plants sheltered by the two types of artificial fences.",90,11,1253,1270,Canopy; Crop; Windbreak; Yield (wine); Wind speed; Aeolian processes; Herbaceous plant; Microclimate; Environmental science; Agronomy,,,,,http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/76795 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167610502002568,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-6105(02)00256-8,,10.1016/s0167-6105(02)00256-8,2016366568,,0,006-515-479-160-998; 008-778-194-636-419; 020-822-906-437-291; 022-125-668-188-590; 022-648-804-684-488; 025-617-623-854-289; 031-545-558-953-252; 032-105-596-761-670; 038-766-077-028-908; 042-086-080-355-841; 055-272-979-440-746; 057-879-278-560-124; 061-335-256-271-945; 062-823-090-701-181; 064-032-221-133-316; 067-990-898-307-195; 068-147-020-028-195; 068-877-878-083-755; 068-983-826-181-555; 069-214-194-403-411; 080-147-291-316-417; 082-435-117-689-276; 084-691-264-150-591; 097-641-582-834-960; 098-542-426-236-574; 104-205-410-318-899; 109-589-023-105-532; 112-195-735-389-867; 120-166-770-024-692; 130-107-442-958-798; 135-708-770-441-179; 137-778-410-171-247; 144-622-516-468-447; 162-827-131-386-24X; 181-030-400-046-077; 192-361-615-995-427,11

H. Wearing; Kate Colhoun,"Abstract Oystershell scale, Diaspidiotus ostreaeformis, is a pest of fruit crops in Otago and Canterbury that is well controlled within orchards but becomes a problem at harvest due to invasion from external host trees. Its major pest status on export crops comes from its being indistinguishable on harvested fruit from the critical quarantine pest San Jose scale Diaspidiotus perniciosus. Oystershell scale has a wide host range which includes trees frequently used as orchard shelter. The distribution of oystershell scale in apples adjacent to an infested shelter belt was investigated in Otago in 1995–96. Apple infestation was >90% next to the shelter and declined linearly to <1% 64 m away. The slope of this linear regression was similar on four cultivars of apple but infestation increased substantially from early- to late-harvested cultivars. The phenology of oystershell scale on apples in 1998–2000 was found to precede that on a range of other hosts, which extended the period of risk of fruit infestation ...",39,1,35,49,Integrated pest management; Windbreak; Horticulture; PEST analysis; Infestation; San Jose scale; Orchard; Diaspididae; Phenology; Biology,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00288330.2010.524146,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2010.524146,,10.1080/00288330.2010.524146,2123537186,,0,000-071-867-139-83X; 007-192-625-390-787; 033-666-691-229-54X; 041-830-774-320-527; 052-902-471-217-230; 080-464-689-879-032; 086-126-339-081-422; 086-238-744-397-750; 088-235-403-301-609; 097-588-991-257-260; 130-060-435-934-805,5

Field margins have considerable ecological significance in agriculture-dominated landscapes, but are affected by interaction with management practices in the margin and on adjoining land. This study investigated the time period over which changes in management practices best explains the occurrence of 40 plant species now commonly found in 311 field margins of Zone Atelier Armorique, Brittany, France. Five management practices were surveyed every year since 1995. Species occurrence was recorded in 2007, 2011 and 2013 and related by means of GLMMs to management practices over time, up to a maximum of 12 years, i.e., scores of field margins on the two first axes of correspondence analysis (CA) performed on management practices. Model selection using AIC criteria allowed us to identify the time period over which to consider management practices that best explain plant patterns. For one third of the common 40 plant species recorded, the time period over which to consider management practices was greater than one year. The rest of the species showed inconsistent patterns with high level of variability between 2007, 2011 and 2013. The time period tended to be longer for species with vegetative reproduction and for zoochorous species. Our results show that the long-term simultaneous monitoring of both vegetation and management practices is important to understand some ecological patterns that would be missed either in short-term studies or for studies that exclude management information. Our findings contribute to long-term strategies for management and conservation of field margins diversity by highlighting that different plant groups require management on particular timescales.",211,,164,172,Trait; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Correspondence analysis; Vegetation; Period (geology); Ecology; Geography; Diversity (business); Management information systems,,,,Zone Atelier Armorique; French Ministry of Environment,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880915002261 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880915002261,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2015.06.008,,10.1016/j.agee.2015.06.008,805897535,,0,007-243-303-723-240; 008-357-250-015-698; 009-263-421-936-141; 010-225-312-935-498; 013-708-466-279-580; 014-555-428-788-888; 015-796-697-992-282; 018-023-127-841-209; 018-188-143-029-347; 019-247-999-933-484; 021-935-807-677-203; 023-393-315-850-638; 028-917-029-117-685; 030-957-113-466-229; 034-314-726-408-829; 037-201-203-399-845; 042-303-914-852-499; 043-964-700-785-467; 045-926-837-803-588; 046-462-915-703-966; 051-075-307-068-357; 051-798-800-485-348; 056-585-869-238-25X; 056-789-845-462-569; 057-084-588-654-231; 058-174-617-271-519; 066-798-350-178-950; 068-896-840-083-964; 070-194-102-378-889; 071-601-864-758-089; 076-304-756-957-962; 077-290-740-041-564; 077-891-993-031-026; 081-372-675-919-660; 082-410-219-435-911; 084-259-323-394-375; 098-771-071-890-612; 109-720-289-819-488; 117-345-687-903-78X; 118-194-599-562-277; 126-256-878-028-916; 131-728-541-984-981; 142-397-350-047-958; 156-624-196-949-616; 187-050-769-304-212,23

Bradburn; W.M. Aust; C.A. Dolloff; D. Cumbia; J. Creighton,"Forested riparian buffer strips are recommended as an agricultural best management practice for protection of water quality and for wildlife habitat. Since the 1990s, federal and state conservation agencies in Virginia have been involved in establishment of riparian buffers under the auspices of programs, such as the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). Riparian buffers established by the CREP program are considered to be beneficial towards the protection of water quality. However, the benefit is based upon assumption that planted trees and shrubs survive and grow. Little evaluation has been done within the state to document the success of the establishment efforts. We evaluated 63 riparian planting sites located in the Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and Ridge and Valley physiographic provinces of Virginia. Overall, the riparian forests in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont were fully stocked due to a combination of planted and natural regeneration. Riparian forests in the Ridge and Valley region were inadequately stocked, and the region has problems with invasive, exotic species. Major recommendations for improving the success of future riparian restoration and establishment efforts are to (1) include the potential for natural regeneration when planning CREP plantings, (2) stop mechanized operations in the riparian buffers that reduce planted and natural regeneration (e.g., mowing and disking), (3) reduce herbivory (particularly cattle) within the riparian buffer, and (4) control invasive exotic species as necessary.",65,2,105,112,Riparian zone; Riparian forest; Introduced species; Coastal plain; Habitat; Riparian buffer; Buffer zone; Environmental science; Agroforestry; Restoration ecology,,,,,http://www.jswconline.org/lookup/doi/10.2489/jswc.65.2.105 https://www.jswconline.org/content/65/2/105 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103130233 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103130233.html https://www.jswconline.org/content/65/2/105.full.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.65.2.105,,10.2489/jswc.65.2.105,1974889653,,0,015-514-563-181-208; 015-647-658-553-798; 016-096-002-977-908; 019-768-015-132-128; 026-181-938-334-685; 029-294-447-653-235; 044-820-024-059-673; 047-920-434-433-346; 048-236-890-450-284; 048-513-319-982-524; 049-840-251-919-899; 050-710-805-223-931; 059-605-387-511-625; 059-638-521-710-950; 068-997-932-046-194; 070-390-742-240-042; 080-589-148-600-106; 082-797-391-654-568; 082-852-563-985-603; 091-210-464-407-877; 099-499-627-996-022; 111-435-647-398-863; 129-094-553-661-174; 134-191-656-379-548; 141-101-347-131-583; 144-279-645-115-466; 145-082-228-272-951; 147-171-523-241-426; 149-841-348-990-763; 151-096-751-331-332; 164-350-768-837-199,3

The study was conducted in Paltan-myun, Hwaseong-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea. Ground-dwelling spiders were collected by pitfall traps from November 2000 to October 2003 in four agricultural field margin types (levee, dike, hillock and streamside). The biodiversity of spider species was higher in the levee and dike than in the hillock and streamside. A similar trend was shown in the biodiversity of dominant spider species. Habitat types were well separated according to overall spider species as well as dominant spider species. The hillock was distinctive from the other habitat types. Linyphiidae, Lycosidae and Theridiidae, the dominant spider families in the study sites, distinguished the hillock from other habitat types but failed to do so in the other habitat types.

M. Blomqvist; Wil L. M. Tamis; G.R. de Snoo,"Abstract Restoring plant species richness in intensively farmed areas by means of agri-environment schemes (AES) seems particularly difficult. We studied the effectiveness of a decade of AES in enhancing biodiversity in ditch banks on six modern dairy farms in the Western Peat District in the Netherlands, taking into account the roles of local productivity and of regional diversity and productivity. Biodiversity is characterised as total number of vascular plant species and number of target plant species and productivity as biomass, Ellenberg N -value and grass/forb ratio. We analyzed the repeated AES releves sampled in two periods, 1993–1995 and 2000–2003 and the diversity–productivity relationships in space and over time. For the analysis of the role of the regional factors, repeated AES and reference releves were compared. Number of target species remained stable, whilst the total number of species decreased, and the productivity increased in general in AES ditch banks. We found a clear negative diversity–productivity relationship in space and over time. AES ditch banks showed higher total number of species and comparable to higher number of target species than the reference ditch banks, in general, however, the productivity was also lower in AES ditch banks. The development of AES ditch banks was similar to the regional developments, although differences tended to become smaller in the study period. We hypothesize that the main reason that ditch bank AES do not overall successfully reduce productivity, is because the AES also recommended late mowing and that because of colonization constraints, the region cannot contribute to a positive development. Improvement of AES should, therefore, include adaptation of the mowing regime in high-productivity situations as well as regional strategies to restore the biodiversity of the ditch bank flora.",10,4,368,378,Biomass (ecology); Biodiversity; Forb; Global biodiversity; Ecology; Productivity; Ditch; Park Grass Experiment; Species richness; Agroforestry; Biology,,,,,http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/378393 https://pure.knaw.nl/portal/en/publications/no-improvement-of-plant-biodiversity-in-ditch-banks-after-a-decad https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20093200093.html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179108000790 https://core.ac.uk/display/29253698 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093200093,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2008.08.007,,10.1016/j.baae.2008.08.007,1984503755,,0,005-235-185-219-437; 005-428-486-066-99X; 006-905-590-991-195; 008-300-944-870-966; 010-220-409-341-722; 014-226-881-970-330; 015-968-204-885-015; 016-421-756-148-512; 017-804-714-249-547; 018-028-975-115-624; 021-907-377-633-412; 030-455-252-413-725; 043-900-591-870-482; 044-351-103-625-865; 052-280-831-507-589; 052-363-993-930-092; 056-099-523-856-735; 064-851-946-815-719; 071-638-295-918-810; 073-060-580-767-315; 074-645-065-895-355; 076-353-969-032-964; 078-096-386-355-946; 090-427-509-282-838; 090-986-649-586-527; 093-637-722-138-450; 098-771-071-890-612; 104-651-081-143-273; 123-944-546-035-933; 135-490-743-957-488; 141-054-075-920-431; 164-035-211-587-268; 164-604-842-857-145; 173-125-764-405-837; 175-603-458-395-585; 199-728-967-099-40X,45

Holland; Barbara Smith; Jonathan Storkey; P. J. W. Lutman; Nicholas J. Aebischer,"Abstract Agri-environment scheme habitats can support declining pollinators, but optimum approaches for deployment remain uncertain. The impact of three management treatments (project-, farm-managed and organic farming) alongside habitat type, quantity of uncropped land removed from production and spatial configuration (strips or blocks) on wild bees, butterflies and hoverflies were investigated. Pollinators were assessed on 28 sites over three years, along boundaries representing site scale ( ca . 100-ha) and within project-managed (floristically enhanced grass, wild bird seed mix, insect rich cover and natural regeneration) or farm-managed wildlife habitats (typically grass margins or game cover). Project-management resulted in the creation of the most widely utilised habitats (floristically enhanced grass and wild bird seed mixtures), but these may attract wild bees away from boundaries whereas butterfly abundance (Lycaenidae and Pieridae) was enhanced along field boundaries. Organic management and spatial configuration of habitats had little impact. Proportion of uncropped land per site was positively related to Cuckoo bee, Lycaenidae and Satyridae density and butterfly species richness at site scale and on the density of several bee species, total wild bees, Pieridae and total butterflies in wildlife habitats. The mean abundance of uncropped land was 3.6% and at least double this was required to double the abundance of wild bees and butterflies. Wild bee densities were highest in field boundaries and floristically enhanced grass and positively correlated with flower cover. Butterflies sought habitats containing their larval food plants and high flower cover. Hoverflies were most abundant in the insect rich cover.

Bryan; Louis B. Best,"-Grassed waterways have been used for decades to prevent soil erosion in agricultural cropland, but their benefits to wildlife had not been evaluated prior to our study. We documented bird species composition and relative abundance during the breeding season in 44 grassed waterways in central Iowa. The waterways were planted predominately to smooth brome (Bromus inermis) and were in cornfields and soybean fields. Forty-eight bird species were observed in waterways, compared with only 14 in the surrounding crop fields. Red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), dickcissels (Spiza americana), barn swallows (Hirundo rustica), western meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta), brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) were the most abundant bird species in the grassed waterways. Total bird abundance in the grassed waterways averaged 2198 birds observed/census/100 ha compared with 682 in crop fields. Temporal patterns in bird abundance were attributed primarily to aspects of the waterways and surrounding cropland that changed over time, such as vegetation height. Because most (53%) of the bird species were at peak abundance in the waterways during 4-22 July, grassed waterways should not be mowed until the end of August or early",126,1,90,,Relative species abundance; Ecology; Geography; Ammodramus; Agelaius; Hirundo; Bromus inermis; Sturnella neglecta; Species richness; Abundance (ecology),,,,,http://www.jstor.org/stable/2426153?origin=crossref,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2426153,,10.2307/2426153,2334202675,,0,025-575-183-192-29X; 037-383-918-033-070; 044-255-923-406-705; 062-403-673-177-448; 064-660-396-683-878; 079-666-057-795-455; 083-665-162-525-30X; 099-145-702-135-815; 101-181-727-684-317; 107-002-386-586-197; 107-267-138-795-815; 110-050-807-675-927; 127-017-540-831-013; 130-251-450-905-772; 133-305-420-936-48X; 135-897-206-750-582; 136-686-951-615-635; 140-725-847-725-141; 142-611-006-532-465; 144-279-645-115-466,52

Baseline soil properties (texture, pH, C and nutrients) of the riparian buffer surrounding a tributary of Cane Run Creek in Fayette County, KY were characterized prior to imposing three mowing regimes (intense, moderate, and no mow treatments) and one native grass regime. Measurements were made along parallel transects located 2-m and 8-m distances from the stream. Root biomass, aggregate distribution, and saturated hydraulic conductivity were measured along the 2-m transect in two consecutive years following treatment establishment. The 2-m transect soils had the highest C, pH, Ca, Zn, and sand content. The 8-m transect had the highest P, K, Mg, and clay content. Semivariogram analysis of C content indicated slight to moderate spatial dependency along the 2m transect and moderate to strong spatial dependency along the 8m transect. Root biomass increased with decreased mowing frequency at the surface depth after one year; the native grass treatment had significantly less root biomass in both years compared to mowing treatments. There was no significant treatment effect on aggregate size distribution at the surface depth in either year. Mean weight diameter and large macroaggregates decreased from 2011 to 2012. Vegetation treatment had no statistically significant effect on water stable aggregates or saturated hydraulic conductivity. Experimental semivariograms provided evidence of spatial structure at multiple scales in root biomass, aggregates, and soil C. Spatial variability occurred over a shorter lag distance in 2012 than 2011, suggesting an effect of imposed treatments slowly developing over time. This study provides important insights on riparian buffer soil properties, soil sampling strategies to detect spatial variability in riparian buffers, and length of time needed to assess effects of vegetation management regimes on riparian root biomass, soil aggregates, and hydraulic conductivity.",,,,,Riparian zone; Infiltration (hydrology); Soil science; Soil water; Riparian buffer; Hydrology; Environmental science; Hydraulic conductivity; Transect; Soil management; Spatial variability,,,,,https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&context=pss_etds https://uknowledge.uky.edu/pss_etds/27/,https://uknowledge.uky.edu/pss_etds/27/,,,157004022,,0,000-073-950-100-003; 000-175-740-417-165; 002-967-588-995-064; 003-603-625-912-432; 004-749-122-558-927; 004-771-960-697-150; 004-888-973-471-782; 006-550-081-866-468; 009-969-155-123-483; 010-444-920-504-739; 011-084-469-305-195; 011-116-935-334-772; 013-290-771-659-381; 013-358-646-128-264; 013-733-325-784-203; 013-786-600-612-318; 013-872-342-900-78X; 014-026-509-704-03X; 017-640-430-568-126; 018-253-057-463-110; 019-247-155-259-303; 019-443-686-709-770; 019-622-915-734-27X; 020-122-932-561-803; 020-743-403-667-831; 022-499-933-595-637; 024-043-475-626-80X; 025-751-077-629-320; 031-051-143-397-709; 031-859-001-391-928; 032-548-119-922-032; 034-697-909-929-724; 035-093-656-083-327; 035-755-692-140-413; 038-439-180-047-201; 042-078-760-272-222; 042-380-024-265-988; 042-646-115-493-463; 043-159-456-949-965; 048-513-319-982-524; 050-653-235-610-13X; 051-192-674-476-662; 053-270-191-856-939; 055-316-831-627-565; 055-963-378-310-893; 056-578-132-592-582; 057-283-555-498-270; 057-789-741-091-819; 058-186-704-920-650; 062-077-119-226-977; 063-866-301-400-693; 063-913-056-687-369; 064-417-192-270-879; 064-865-041-422-256; 067-887-666-057-021; 068-638-232-359-523; 070-748-151-329-671; 071-017-491-620-470; 073-703-019-282-474; 073-970-910-327-180; 075-177-805-296-166; 083-181-646-900-179; 093-925-899-544-231; 094-542-141-276-251; 095-582-711-973-116; 096-126-707-260-671; 098-594-671-307-115; 100-466-720-517-826; 101-190-301-433-89X; 106-326-670-011-15X; 106-420-178-731-885; 107-490-921-089-850; 109-941-293-087-776; 111-606-443-415-864; 119-010-695-168-082; 124-766-514-685-103; 127-785-284-544-120; 131-436-898-248-747; 148-135-365-025-100; 150-026-188-323-914; 156-501-156-197-472; 159-587-032-641-18X; 160-315-306-101-719; 167-956-786-519-034; 168-270-701-803-491; 174-103-363-317-763; 179-039-702-328-618; 192-939-307-304-522; 193-467-462-074-37X; 196-381-785-440-137,0

Sullivan; Druscilla S. Sullivan; J. Hazel-rah Sullivan,"Riparian zones in agricultural landscapes provide linear non-crop habitats for a variety of plant and mammal species, and hence are an important component of biodiversity. To date, variable responses of abundance, species richness, and species diversity of small mammals have been recorded in riparian and upland habitats. To address this variability, we provide a detailed analysis of seasonal changes in abundance and diversity of terrestrial small-mammal communities over a 7-year period within an agricultural landscape in south-central British Columbia, Canada. We tested the hypotheses (H) that abundance, species richness, and species diversity of communities of small mammals (H1), and demographic parameters of reproduction, recruitment, and survival of the major species: deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and montane vole (Microtus montanus) (H2), would be higher in riparian than upland habitats. Mean total abundance of small mammals was higher in summer and winter, and species richness higher in summer, in riparian than hedgerow habitats. Winter population data supported the total and species abundance patterns for small mammals, but species richness was similar, and diversity lower, in riparian than hedgerow sites during winter periods. Deer mice were the dominant species in terms of abundance and reproductive output for pregnancies and recruitment, but not survival, in riparian sites. Montane voles were similar in abundance and demographic parameters in the two habitats. House mice (Mus musculus) preferred hedgerows and wandering shrews (Sorex vagrans) riparian sites. Demographic parameters for deer mice and montane voles indicated that both riparian and hedgerow sites were “source” rather than “sink” habitats, and likely contribute to maintenance of mammal diversity in agricultural landscapes.",59,2,325,336,Riparian zone; Relative species abundance; Biodiversity; Ecology; Population; Deer mouse; House mice; Species richness; Species diversity; Biology,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13364-013-0172-7 http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-7aed4559-e5c0-4d70-9dff-61d508485567 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs13364-013-0172-7.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13364-013-0172-7,,10.1007/s13364-013-0172-7,2166046588,,0,001-119-786-453-188; 001-408-607-248-201; 006-999-936-124-604; 008-225-619-668-580; 010-094-499-725-708; 010-594-494-967-063; 012-115-765-872-472; 013-458-617-723-054; 015-218-916-563-767; 015-506-981-621-157; 017-011-497-062-46X; 020-360-071-779-440; 020-544-650-878-888; 023-820-005-022-574; 025-009-993-658-497; 026-162-389-848-750; 026-931-939-363-170; 028-786-603-965-607; 034-024-620-732-510; 035-080-975-349-687; 035-093-656-083-327; 039-270-311-852-944; 043-062-864-287-955; 043-819-346-205-923; 045-301-379-894-290; 046-544-938-173-565; 046-706-622-716-331; 047-800-573-929-302; 048-572-904-145-452; 049-869-993-442-064; 050-143-206-182-340; 059-638-521-710-950; 061-401-711-406-024; 067-070-378-841-691; 068-452-604-669-157; 068-488-271-134-879; 070-261-738-610-695; 073-510-797-164-772; 074-793-529-288-006; 079-261-909-912-581; 085-082-365-838-486; 087-478-261-202-743; 093-818-216-109-633; 095-877-317-702-391; 096-010-724-323-262; 101-150-316-380-050; 114-511-525-881-532; 122-231-647-378-410; 123-822-948-779-905; 125-707-880-940-115; 128-940-968-633-646; 131-388-223-425-932; 137-515-299-723-36X; 139-236-139-870-281; 142-238-278-183-673; 144-004-660-034-012; 147-490-702-686-71X; 147-553-127-849-679; 149-637-084-258-22X; 155-879-620-292-827; 160-159-765-594-186; 161-425-757-559-60X; 170-043-204-409-049; 171-939-686-679-559; 172-795-255-627-550; 175-779-280-741-67X; 190-122-359-774-236,4

The Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra is considered a suitable indicator for the conservation value of farmland habitats, and has recently suffered strong declines throughout much of its European range. As a basis for targeted conservation measures, we investigated the habitat preferences of this species in north-eastern Germany by comparing the composition of male territories with randomly chosen control sites. A territory was defined as the area within a radius of 150 meters around the assumed centre of the territory, as the majority of nests is found within this radius. To assess food availability for nestlings, arthropod abundance within the most abundant land use types i.e. crop fields, fallows, grassland as well as within unploughed strips was investigated. In total we found 102 male Corn Bunting territories, which were mainly composed of crop fields (50%), grassland (28%), and fallows (12%). Territories compared with control sites were characterized by a lower proportion of crop fields, a higher proportion of fallows, more diverse land use types, more abundant field boundaries, unploughed strips, and tracks, and a higher availability of song posts. However, neither the number of larger (≥ 1 cm), smaller ( 10%) and song posts (> 70 m 'linear song posts' or > 1 solitary post per ha) for the habitat selection of male Corn Buntings. We conclude that measures to halt population declines of Corn Buntings seem to be relatively easy to implement, provided that farmers are granted a fair compensation.",50,1,1,10,Biodiversity; Spatial heterogeneity; Habitat; Range (biology); Geography; Emberiza; Corn bunting; Bunting; Population; Forestry,,,,,https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:d61147d https://bioone.org/journals/Acta-Ornithologica/volume-50/issue-1/00016454AO2015.50.1.001/Habitat-Preferences-of-Male-Corn-Buntings-Emberiza-calandra-in-North/10.3161/00016454AO2015.50.1.001.full https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/b85267ad-76ac-4e03-a69e-88f73f361dc1 https://bioone.org/journals/Acta-Ornithologica/volume-50/issue-1/00016454AO2015.50.1.001/Habitat-Preferences-of-Male-Corn-Buntings-Emberiza-calandra-in-North/10.3161/00016454AO2015.50.1.001.short,http://dx.doi.org/10.3161/00016454ao2015.50.1.001,,10.3161/00016454ao2015.50.1.001,2117055005,,0,000-372-697-454-296; 004-595-408-328-159; 007-416-181-403-689; 007-925-989-089-755; 008-021-451-861-242; 016-421-756-148-512; 020-052-458-385-02X; 020-297-923-380-079; 022-257-102-279-260; 023-103-648-255-011; 023-956-883-673-760; 024-366-690-945-99X; 025-590-233-770-242; 028-955-327-048-080; 031-592-787-048-258; 036-603-066-196-560; 042-014-439-999-529; 042-082-544-198-293; 043-159-873-957-616; 043-583-117-779-984; 044-307-871-990-779; 047-667-611-430-765; 049-772-867-980-282; 052-363-993-930-092; 054-578-093-359-274; 056-221-337-998-429; 059-649-458-440-049; 060-210-993-352-731; 065-834-081-364-219; 069-752-374-178-061; 073-935-983-022-480; 077-918-560-780-184; 084-788-421-393-425; 086-626-249-909-151; 087-291-119-579-822; 090-654-642-355-610; 095-014-169-963-827; 107-745-401-264-178; 125-995-631-935-63X; 126-051-353-473-137; 142-690-041-023-63X; 146-139-013-657-783; 165-804-108-473-473; 182-718-522-127-248; 197-392-866-862-614,5

Robinson; David A. Elston; Xavier Lambin; William J. Sutherland; Tim G. Benton,"Summary; ; ; 1. Understanding the mechanisms by which environmental change has impacted natural processes typically requires good time series for the environmental change. Unfortunately, other than for climate, detailed time series of historical environments are scarce. In many instances, researchers can only collate disparate and sometimes fragmented information from the literature or from historical or pre-historical sources.; ; ; ; 2. Here, we apply modern statistical methods to reconstruct a recent historical time series of environmental change from sparse data collected from heterogeneous sources. Specifically, we deal with record irregularity and the varying levels of uncertainty associated with each datum using state-space models in a hierarchical Bayesian framework.; ; ; ; 3. As an example, we reconstruct a time series of a simple landscape feature (hedgerow length) over a large spatial scale (Britain) over a long-time period (50 years), by combining both stock estimates and rate of change estimates, gathered from different historical sources.; ; ; ; 4. We illustrate the utility of the method by relating the population trends of a hedgerow-nesting passerine bird, the yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella to the reconstructed trends in hedgerow length.

Williams; Ganti S. Murthy,"Lands producing mixed lignocellulosic ethanol feedstocks may be able to produce more biomass with fewer resources than conventional monoculture crops, but lignocellulosic ethanol production processes and efficiencies can be highly dependent on feedstock composition. In this study, plants were collected from areas planted to simulate conservation buffers alongside stream channels within three common resource areas the interior Pacific Northwest. Two grasses (tall wheatgrass and alfalfa) and seven forb species (fiddleneck tarweed, dog fennel, kochia, downey brome, tall annual willowherb, prickly lettuce, and tumble mustard) commonly found in these buffers were examined to determine their chemical composition, potential bioethanol yields, and difficulties that may arise if they were to be harvested and processed in a single facility. Potential ethanol yields calculated on the basis of sugar monomer composition in the biomass ranged from 181.5 to 316.5 l/dry ton of biomass. Significant differences were noted in terms of structural sugars (cellulose 19%–33% w/w; hemicellulose 14%–26% w/w), lignin (10%–18% w/w), extractives (20%–40% w/w), and ash content (4.0%–13.8% w/w).

The relationships among VFS length, concentration and; mass transport were well-represented by first-order exponential decay functions. Approximately 75% of incoming total; Kjeldahl N, total P, ortho-P, and total suspended solids was removed within the first 6.1 m of the filter strips.

In recent decades the botanical diversity of arable field boundaries has declined drastically. To determine the most important factors related to the species composition of arable field boundaries, the vegetation composition of 105 herbaceous boundaries, 1-m wide, in the central and eastern Netherlands was surveyed. Biomass samples of the boundary were taken at 0-33, 34-66 and 67-100 cm from the adjacent arable field. 2. Farmers were interviewed with respect to boundary management and land use on the adjacent arable field. The two data sets containing the botanical data and the environmental variables were linked and analysed by multivariate analysis and analysis of variance. 3. The nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to the crop were closely correlated to another environmental variable, crop rotation. Crop rotations dominated by maize cultivation received significantly higher nutrient inputs than the other rotations. 4. Nitrogen, phosphorus and crop rotation were strongly correlated with the composition of the boundary vegetation. Species richness of the boundary vegetation was negatively related to nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to the crop, while total boundary biomass was negatively related to nitrogen inputs only. Furthermore, there was a significant relationship between the partitioning of the boundary vegetation between different functional groups and both nitrogen inputs and crop rotation on the adjacent arable field. No significant relationships were found between the vegetation composition and either herbicide use in the boundary or boundary management. This may have been due to the descriptive approach of the study: little variation in boundary management as well as herbicide use in the boundary was observed in the study area. 5. The boundary vegetation was characterized by a peak in biomass production in the zone near the arable field. In this zone the perennial arable weed Elymus repens, as well as annual dicot species, were significantly more abundant, while perennial dicots and monocots were significantly less abundant compared with the zones further from the arable field. 6. Efforts to protect field boundary vegetation need to focus on a reduction or cessation of fertilizer applications in the outer metre(s) of crops that require high nutrient inputs. The determination of the exact nature of the relationship between the vegetation composition of arable field boundaries and the intuitively important management and herbicide use in the boundary requires an experimental approach.",37,2,256,266,Biomass (ecology); Vegetation; Crop rotation; Fertilizer; Environmental science; Land use; Plant community; Species richness; Agronomy; Arable land,,,,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00486.x https://www.jstor.org/stable/2655908 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00486.x https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20002303155 http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/64268,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00486.x,,10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00486.x,2143599749,,0,009-646-332-019-745; 010-023-731-010-670; 010-289-510-628-686; 011-808-570-962-836; 015-522-490-223-197; 022-994-627-626-27X; 034-200-514-640-583; 039-505-502-984-134; 041-161-807-605-997; 050-532-464-266-167; 056-892-041-411-85X; 060-086-333-706-623; 061-228-767-301-276; 063-003-550-683-547; 065-532-525-025-872; 069-379-822-515-162; 078-966-178-941-701; 082-389-624-773-160; 086-402-015-642-906; 114-480-653-531-829; 122-225-350-278-127; 122-593-714-312-795; 132-380-117-709-640; 143-273-453-722-006; 145-199-506-693-553; 152-877-616-714-726; 167-881-697-695-876; 187-050-769-304-212,171

Rantanen; Francis Buner; Philip Riordan; Nick Sotherton; David W. Macdonald,"Summary; 1. Wildlife reintroductions can help to restore populations and save species from extinction. However, success rates of reintroductions are low due to inherent problems, such as behavioural deficiencies resulting in high post-release predation rates among captive-bred animals. In particular, the released animals may use habitats maladaptively, leading to an ecological trap, i.e. preference for low-quality habitats leading to reduced survival and/or breeding success. Ecological traps in reintroductions can be identified only through intensive studies of habitat preferences and survival of known individuals, but such studies are lacking.; ; 2. We investigated habitat preferences and their relationship with survival by radio-tracking reintroduced, captive-bred grey partridges Perdix perdix, a widely reintroduced commercial game species and native farmland bird of conservation concern in the UK. The low success rate of grey partridge releases could be due to maladaptive habitat use and a possible ecological trap.; ; 3. Grey partridges released as pairs in spring showed preferences for crop and field margin habitat. The use of crops had a positive, and use of field margins a negative, association with survival, suggesting field margins could serve as ecological traps for released grey partridges. Predation rates were high, and field margins probably hosted concentrated predator activity.; ; 4. Grey partridges released as family groups (coveys) in autumn exhibited a preference for game covers, i.e. areas of tall vegetation specifically planted to provide cover for game birds, and mortality rates were lower than in spring. Habitat use did not affect survival in autumn.; ; 5. Synthesis and applications. We have shown that newly released grey partridge pairs behave maladaptively by preferring a habitat which has a negative association with survival. In grey partridge reintroductions, we recommend releasing grey partridge family groups in autumn rather than releasing pairs of birds in spring, and providing game covers that could induce the groups to settle onto the release areas. In reintroductions in general, the habitat preferences of the released animals should be documented together with their fates, to enable detection of possible ecological traps that could threaten the success of these conservation efforts.",47,6,1357,1364,Wildlife conservation; Wildlife management; Habitat; Ecology; Ecological trap; Perdix; Grey partridge; Wildlife; Animal ecology; Biology,,,,,https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01867.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01867.x/full https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01867.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01867.x https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01867.x https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103351791 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103351791.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01867.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01867.x,1593695442,,0,011-693-938-201-836; 013-161-341-622-668; 016-080-943-476-05X; 016-646-844-705-347; 020-131-452-110-549; 023-258-160-889-826; 026-656-472-015-127; 031-463-472-944-049; 036-855-574-030-250; 046-221-404-876-286; 046-890-565-150-53X; 047-000-620-546-182; 047-446-378-411-883; 049-280-320-600-396; 049-557-478-030-177; 052-141-425-637-37X; 057-899-802-924-990; 059-431-792-692-469; 062-640-771-728-564; 067-947-244-097-527; 073-344-697-836-016; 074-225-773-604-407; 076-054-234-018-301; 076-278-055-254-459; 083-180-942-841-13X; 085-648-445-233-129; 098-143-627-905-764; 099-193-137-418-404; 106-081-154-740-548; 107-103-881-087-523; 111-720-755-311-457; 111-728-793-696-876; 112-037-725-164-038; 115-851-025-395-201; 143-273-453-722-006; 144-459-648-233-482; 163-081-385-554-379; 172-542-474-113-706; 189-825-034-428-998,33

Smith; Philip J. Barbour; L. Wes Burger; Stephen J. Dinsmore,"Grassland bird populations are sharply declining in North America. Changes in agricultural practices during the past 50 years have been suggested as one of the major causes of this decline. Field-border conservation practices encouraged by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Conservation Buffer Initia- tive meet many of the needs of sustainable agriculture and offer excellent opportunities to enhance local grassland bird populations within intensive agricultural production systems. Despite the abundant information on avian use of, and reproductive success in, strip habitats during the breeding season, few studies have examined the potential value of field borders for wintering birds. We planted 89.0 km of field borders (6.1 m wide) along agricultural field edges on one-half of each of three row crop and forage production farms in northeastern Mississippi. We sampled bird communities along these field edges during February-March 2002 and 2003 using line-transect distance sampling and strip transects to estimate density and community structure, respectively. We used Program DISTANCE to estimate densities of Song (Melospiza melodia), Savannah (Passerculus sand- wichensis), and other sparrows along bordered and non-bordered transects while controlling for adjacent plant community. Greater densities of several sparrow species were observed along most bordered transects. However, effects of field borders differed by species and adjacent plant community types. Diversity, species richness, and relative conservation value (a weighted index derived by multiplying species-specific abundances by their re- spective Partners in Flight conservation priority scores) were similar between bordered and non-bordered edges.

The conservation value of these habitats, however, cannot be fully ascertained while plant species richness and composition remain unknown. We describe the vegetation composition of woodlot edges and hedgerows associated with agricultural fields of different farming intensities. We inventoried thirteen woodlot edges and hedgerows in each of three types of farming systems characterized mainly by different frequency of tillage and by different levels of herbicide and fertilizer use. The number and percentage cover of species present did not differ greatly between farming regimes whereas the species composition varied considerably. In habitats adjacent to intensively farmed fields, we found more short-lived grassy-type plants that were largely of introduced ori...",8,2,544,557,Biodiversity; Abiotic component; Tillage; Habitat; Ecology; Woodland; Geography; Woodlot; Species richness; Agroforestry; Species diversity,,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/1051-0761(1998)008%5b0544:IOAPAE%5d2.0.CO%3b2/abstract http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/1051-0761(1998)008[0544:IOAPAE]2.0.CO;2 https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/1051-0761%281998%29008%5B0544%3AIOAPAE%5D2.0.CO%3B2 https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?request_locale=en&recordID=US1997066880 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/1051-0761%281998%29008%5B0544%3AIOAPAE%5D2.0.CO%3B2 https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/1051-0761%281998%29008%5B0544%3AIOAPAE%5D2.0.CO%3B2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(1998)008[0544:ioapae]2.0.co;2,,10.1890/1051-0761(1998)008[0544:ioapae]2.0.co;2,2071310092,,0,003-679-980-399-400; 006-949-579-240-846; 008-591-153-843-438; 013-828-298-879-443; 015-863-314-524-72X; 017-243-695-469-634; 018-059-938-486-356; 027-818-987-445-682; 029-568-331-038-13X; 035-295-879-593-709; 038-137-134-913-232; 041-475-255-071-203; 047-400-624-551-424; 051-103-549-479-234; 057-528-337-703-662; 067-187-328-571-581; 068-371-017-301-193; 083-665-162-525-30X; 084-744-111-694-770; 091-707-812-404-482; 096-158-054-416-806; 100-041-833-619-032; 102-179-852-683-720; 105-771-274-766-023; 108-019-522-634-067; 122-964-173-842-872; 131-462-888-884-79X; 134-797-888-874-528; 142-178-368-818-650; 143-273-453-722-006; 143-950-893-200-143; 144-823-135-793-802; 145-199-506-693-553; 154-978-657-665-321; 155-555-776-794-70X; 163-972-676-901-659; 165-123-901-414-731; 176-481-005-284-747; 180-921-649-870-611; 187-050-769-304-212; 192-059-911-453-65X,190

Anderson.Vita.Ph. D. University of Missouri--Columbia 2010.The U.S. Department of Agriculture initiated the Conservation Effects Assessment Project in 2003 to quantify water quality and wildlife benefits of conservation programs funded by the 2002 Farm Security and Rural Investment Act. This study examined the effects of agricultural best management practices (BMPs) implemented in the Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW) and investigated strategies to target future BMPs. Evaluation of storm events between 1993 and 2006 showed no significant BMP effects on dissolved atrazine and NO3�-N losses after 14% of the GCEW had been affected by BMP establishment. Approximately 20 and 4 years of monitoring will be needed before a statistically significant ([alpha]=0.05) 25% reduction in mean dissolved atrazine and nitrate-N can be demonstrated at the GCEW outlet, respectively. A widely used hydrologic model, SWAT, identified fields adjacent to streams with lesser depths to the argillic horizon as the highest risk for atrazine and NO3�-N pollutant loss. Twenty two percent and 34% of cropped fields in the GCEW required establishment of vegetative filter strips to reduce dissolved atrazine and NO3�-N loads by 25% at the GCEW based on SWAT predictions. A 99% accurate method to quantify soil redoximorphic features (SRFs) was developed using a digital camera and image classification software. Correlation between quantified SRFs and the topographic wetness index was found for one of two GCEW fields, indicating field soil surveys may serve as relatively quick reconnaissance methods to identify sensitive field areas.Includes bibliographical reference",,,,,Conservation agriculture; Environmental planning; Environmental ethics; History,,,,,https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/handle/10355/8869 https://core.ac.uk/download/62767632.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.32469/10355/8869,,10.32469/10355/8869,2285708891,,0,001-138-458-108-506; 003-451-422-132-663; 008-465-852-455-269; 009-527-513-753-947; 012-105-121-159-031; 014-230-793-247-849; 015-928-903-877-288; 017-406-265-815-780; 020-192-047-584-539; 021-000-854-984-261; 021-772-319-606-63X; 023-152-943-950-042; 023-604-322-132-447; 023-844-340-012-441; 025-181-095-628-338; 026-378-394-769-283; 026-378-989-961-418; 026-802-370-774-790; 031-173-814-599-578; 032-910-022-337-565; 033-965-464-922-934; 036-871-763-041-530; 040-176-508-767-916; 041-071-173-686-553; 045-200-557-996-618; 049-972-832-871-891; 051-402-550-071-21X; 054-161-082-503-505; 054-793-860-572-458; 055-827-505-678-847; 056-925-980-815-607; 060-110-134-684-422; 061-274-077-915-016; 063-558-882-489-061; 067-660-321-460-484; 068-861-957-038-753; 071-738-877-739-423; 072-864-264-319-729; 074-043-575-902-06X; 079-233-446-576-041; 082-755-865-595-93X; 082-919-566-766-178; 085-809-299-662-172; 089-676-415-540-084; 092-375-275-782-901; 092-843-881-158-062; 094-708-242-385-382; 094-912-114-475-410; 100-466-720-517-826; 101-541-986-547-583; 106-567-615-861-01X; 115-951-085-850-999; 116-259-878-794-013; 121-602-950-880-503; 127-733-878-262-337; 135-237-336-876-77X; 141-903-783-051-840; 142-459-785-852-957; 150-743-183-906-776; 152-482-598-992-602; 163-131-992-319-322; 165-388-551-938-802; 168-787-294-584-237; 168-987-436-154-117; 173-208-702-039-564; 180-080-393-079-901; 183-873-049-489-732; 190-561-699-597-429; 192-222-568-839-084,1

During succession, disturbance by farming operations was simulated by a single rotocultivation of the margin strip. Two years after the disturbance event, species richness was not significantly determined by light regime or disturbance level. However, shortly after the disturbance event, disturbance caused a temporary increase in species richness on the unshaded side due to introgression by annual species in created gaps. On the shaded side, species richness was significantly lower in disturbed plots. Disturbance caused a temporary increase in importance of spontaneous annuals, which were quickly replaced by perennial sown and unsown monocotyledons and to a lesser extent by perennial unsown dicotyledons. The importance of spontaneous species within functional groups increased, resulting in higher similarity between sown and unsown vegetation.",112,1,78,86,Biodiversity; Ecological succession; Vegetation; Ecology; Perennial plant; Disturbance (geology); Species richness; Species diversity; Introgression; Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880905003774 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880905003774 https://core.ac.uk/display/55833519,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2005.07.006,,10.1016/j.agee.2005.07.006,2013330700,,0,009-256-582-324-853; 010-289-510-628-686; 015-072-120-385-142; 018-797-363-505-484; 019-490-805-815-106; 020-713-595-267-906; 052-074-034-955-189; 060-212-024-680-436; 063-308-044-981-354; 073-021-383-708-605; 075-781-408-578-136; 102-265-241-261-124; 103-150-198-998-177; 107-594-078-555-622; 111-448-759-012-163; 120-779-030-824-688; 128-964-788-315-612; 129-154-893-686-206; 131-380-497-301-391; 171-723-833-352-554; 188-597-703-306-560; 191-882-753-451-329,8

Schoonover; Karl W. J. Williard,"ABSTRACT: Ground water contamination by excess nitrate leaching in row-crop fields is an important issue in intensive agricultural areas of the United States and abroad. Giant cane and forest riparian buffer zones were monitored to determine each cover type's ability to reduce ground water nitrate concentrations. Ground water was sampled at varying distances from the field edge to determine an effective width for maximum nitrate attenuation. Ground water samples were analyzed for nitrate concentrations as well as chloride concentrations, which were used as a conservative ion to assess dilution or concentration effects within the riparian zone. Significant nitrate reductions occurred in both the cane and the forest riparian buffer zones within the first 3.3 m, a relatively narrow width. In this first 3.3 m, the cane and forest buffer reduced ground water nitrate levels by 90 percent and 61 percent, respectively. Approximately 40 percent of the observed 99 percent nitrate reduction over the 10 m cane buffer could be attributed to dilution by upwelling ground water. Neither ground water dilution nor concentration was observed in the forest buffer.

This 2-yr study compared the impact of grass and grass+tree buffer strips on the exported masses of atrazine, metolachlor, and a degradation product of atrazine, desethylatrazine (DEA). The experimental system consisted of four replicate plots in a three-way completely randomized design (no buffer zone, grass buffer zone, and grass+tree buffer strips). The field plots were 5 m wide and 30 m long and grown in corn. The grass and grass+tree buffer strips were 5 m and had the same grass vegetation except for eight young hybrid poplars. Over the 2-yr study, surface runoff and subsurface infiltration water (under the buffer strip) were collected after the initial three rainfall events after herbicide application. Dissolved atrazine, metolachlor, and DEA were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The presence of buffer strips decreased the exported masses of atrazine and metolachlor in surface runoff. A three-way ANOVA with treatment (type of buffer strip), water (surface runoff or subsurface infiltration), and time between herbicide application and rainfall event as factors showed a significant reduction (40-60% in 2004 and 75-95% in 2005) in the total (surface runoff+infiltrated water) exported masses of atrazine and metolachlor in the presence of buffer strips. Rainfall events after herbicide application were different between the 2 yr and greatly affected the flow distribution (e.g., subsurface infiltration) and the leached herbicide concentrations. No significant difference in the capacity to reduce herbicide exports was observed between grass and grass+tree buffer strip treatments; the poorly developed young poplar biomass at the time of the study may partly explain this observation.",39,2,617,629,Infiltration (hydrology); Woody plant; Buffer zone; Metolachlor; Atrazine; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Agronomy; Groundwater,,"Acetamides/analysis; Atrazine/analysis; Herbicides/analysis; Poaceae; Populus; Trees; Water/analysis; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis; Water Pollution/prevention & control; Weather","Acetamides; Herbicides; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water; Atrazine; metolachlor",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/1459987 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/20176835 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2134/jeq2009.0041 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103188013 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20176835,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2009.0041,20176835,10.2134/jeq2009.0041,1989429872,,0,000-357-531-495-738; 002-650-706-842-54X; 005-046-617-641-306; 006-215-488-410-157; 006-677-293-260-300; 015-334-237-353-133; 019-147-870-381-799; 021-655-763-861-159; 024-556-636-186-088; 024-998-467-249-663; 029-227-515-568-324; 038-439-180-047-201; 038-659-320-814-260; 041-445-679-738-588; 042-230-387-909-769; 042-915-746-150-064; 044-401-317-828-273; 045-878-014-461-966; 049-773-598-549-535; 051-851-638-777-86X; 052-894-240-545-387; 052-924-073-269-366; 054-142-450-794-649; 066-223-103-987-550; 078-834-235-066-428; 086-496-072-727-834; 092-032-769-193-803; 111-288-588-656-115; 113-621-019-415-011; 115-445-992-300-112; 122-905-248-651-828; 178-140-173-536-98X; 181-090-792-931-175; 187-376-050-766-715,28

Orchard ground cover vegetation was very diverse. Grasses were the predominant ground-cover in aisles, with broadleaf plants predominant in the rows. Orchard borders were somewhat less diverse than the orchards themselves. Rubus spp. were the most frequently occurring border plants.

Rahman; Marina Basaglia; Lorenzo Favaro; Bruno Boz; Bruna Gumiero; Sergio Casella,"This research is part of a project aimed at verifying the potential of a specifically assessed wooded riparian zone in removing excess of combined nitrogen from the Zero river flow for the reduction of nutrient input into Venice Lagoon. Specific objectives were pursued to determine seasonal fluctuations of the microbial populations from the input water to a drainage ditch, conveying back the flux into the river after passing through the soil of the wooded riparian strip. The bacterial communities were determined by combined approaches involving cultivation, microscopic methods and DNA based techniques to determine both culturable and total microbial community in water. The results indicate that the size of the bacterial population, including the culturable fraction, increases from the river to the drainage ditch especially on the warm season. The multiple approach here adopted enabled also to demonstrate that the special condition created in the buffer strip supports the development and the metabolism of the microbial community. The nature of the bacterial population, in terms of phylotypes distribution, was investigated by 16S rDNA analysis indicating that the most represented genera belong to Gamma-proteobacteria, which is known to include an exceeding number of important pathogens. In spring, the effect of the buffer strip seems to significantly reduce such a sub-population. The changes observed for the total bacterial community composition become much evident in summer, as revealed by both denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis cluster analysis and by the diversity index calculation. The hydraulic management coupled to the suspension of farming practices and the development of the woody and herbaceous vegetation resulted in a condition suitable for the containment of undesired microbiota (mainly during the spring season) while continuing to support denitrification activity (especially throughout the summer) as verified by the total nitrogen removal.",9,1,33,37,Riparian zone; Nutrient; Vegetation; Ecology; Temperature gradient gel electrophoresis; Diversity index; Hydrology; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Denitrification; Microbial population biology,,,,,http://core.ac.uk/display/27065858 https://core.ac.uk/display/27065858,http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/ija.2014.548,,10.4081/ija.2014.548,1983131210,,0,001-908-622-487-543; 002-170-315-959-238; 007-260-832-996-388; 020-082-581-265-717; 020-977-235-603-557; 027-978-441-083-205; 049-961-487-037-893; 061-480-972-864-355; 069-613-379-269-86X; 071-367-146-562-193; 079-751-866-864-146; 081-516-085-265-089; 082-480-020-214-656; 084-040-930-198-230; 087-218-177-673-058; 111-685-276-532-817; 118-042-835-886-984; 122-075-844-248-680; 166-338-955-667-560; 177-223-877-096-350,2

R. Whiteley; Manon N. Lalonde; N. K. Kaushik,"Vegetated filter strips (VFS) are used recently for removal, at or near the source, of sediment and sediment-bound chemicals from cropland runoff. Vegetation within the flowpath increases water infiltration and decreases water turbulence, thus enhancing pollutant removal by sedimentation within filter media and infiltration through the filter surface. Field experiments have been conducted to examine the efficiency of vegetated filter strips for phosphorus removal from cropland runoff with 20 filters with varying length (2 to 15 m), slope (2.3 and 5%), and vegetated cover, including bare-soil plots as control. Artificial runoff used in this study had an average phosphorus concentration of 2.37 mg L(-1) and a sediment concentration of 2700 mg L(-1). The average phosphorus trapping efficiency of all vegetated filters was 61% and ranged from 31% in a 2-m filter to 89% in a 15-m filter. Filter length has been found to be the predominant factor affecting P trapping in VFS. The rate of inflow, type of vegetation, and density of vegetation coverage had secondary influences on P removal. Short filters (2 and 5 m), which are somewhat effective in sediment removal, are much less effective in P removal. Increasing the filter length beyond 15 m is ineffective in enhancing sediment removal but is expected to further enhance P removal. Sediment deposition, infiltration, and plant adsorption are the primary mechanisms for phosphorus trapping in VFS.",32,2,613,619,Riparian zone; Infiltration (hydrology); Nutrient; Plant cover; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Pollutant; Water pollution,,"Biodegradation, Environmental; Fertilizers; Filtration; Phosphorus/isolation & purification; Plants; Rain; Soil Pollutants/isolation & purification; Water Movements",Fertilizers; Soil Pollutants; Phosphorus,,https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/12708686 https://www.agronomy.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/32/2/613 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/2643688 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12708686 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2134/jeq2003.6130 https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/32/2/613,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2003.6130,12708686,10.2134/jeq2003.6130,2045534199,,0,005-046-617-641-306; 005-404-432-231-180; 009-925-716-397-253; 023-130-997-992-793; 033-410-169-156-000; 034-748-846-517-673; 051-200-045-837-899; 055-590-572-243-787; 072-456-532-531-222; 072-578-528-923-560; 073-926-597-326-182; 076-826-572-086-275; 080-894-085-139-156; 082-797-391-654-568; 105-291-380-498-891; 113-496-738-919-590; 172-864-691-764-70X; 176-609-653-505-894,140

Brandle; Kenneth G. Hubbard,"The effects of wind protection on growth and total and marketable yields of snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) planted at 2-week intervals through the 1994 and 1995 growing seasons were examined. Research was conducted under nonirrigated conditions at the Shel- terbelt Research Area, Univ. of Nebraska Agricultural Research and Development Center (ARDC) near Mead. 'Strike' (white-seeded) and 'Rushmore' (dark-seeded) were planted in locations sheltered from wind stress by tree windbreaks (shelterbelts) and in locations exposed to normal winds using a randomized complete-block design with a split-split plot arrangement of treatments. Air temperature, soil temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction were monitored. Detailed microclimate conditions at bean canopy level in sheltered and exposed plots are provided in the text. Wind speed in sheltered areas averaged 36% of open fi eld wind speed in 1994 and 43% of open wind speed in 1995. Soil tempera- tures were higher in sheltered areas than in exposed areas. Microclimate changes due to shelter had no effect on the percent seedling emergence or number of days to emergence. Plants in shelter had signifi cantly higher total dry weight and leaf area index and greater total internode length than exposed plants. Both total and marketable yields were increased signifi cantly by production under sheltered conditions each year. Planting date and cultivar also had a signifi cant impact on average pod yields. No interactions between shelter and planting date, or shelter and cultivar, were found in either year. The results suggest that wind protection provided by shelterbelts (tree windbreaks) can increase pod yields of snap bean both early and late in the season. This may result in greater profi t for the grower due to a tendency for higher prices at these times.",39,5,996,1004,Wind stress; Canopy; Wind direction; Growing season; Windbreak; Horticulture; Wind speed; Sowing; Microclimate; Environmental science,,,,,http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1385&context=agronomyfacpub https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/agronomyfacpub/385/ https://journals.ashs.org/hortsci/view/journals/hortsci/39/5/article-p996.xml https://journals.ashs.org/view/journals/hortsci/39/5/article-p996.xml https://core.ac.uk/download/188119853.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/hortsci.39.5.996,,10.21273/hortsci.39.5.996,1908889287,,0,007-010-538-582-502; 011-460-693-002-355; 013-500-169-448-090; 017-605-259-887-085; 033-730-646-646-452; 036-875-044-643-824; 040-604-193-241-378; 040-734-317-705-222; 048-796-440-661-610; 057-879-278-560-124; 066-100-113-541-544; 071-321-495-890-132; 092-671-309-612-22X; 106-791-865-939-04X; 114-765-340-699-400; 145-875-846-407-50X; 147-155-321-334-755; 177-834-571-788-699; 188-057-135-356-326; 191-350-680-540-162,15

The buffer was composed of a 5-m wide grass strip and a 1-m wide row of trees. Maize and wheat were cultivated in the neighbouring field during the monitoring period (December 1997-June 1999). Four experimental conditions were monitored, deriving from a combination of two levels of crop N fertilisation and two sizes of buffer trees. The narrow buffer was very effective in abating NO3-N concentrations, allowing water to be discharged with a concentration always below 2 ppm. Its zone of influence might be bigger than its simple width. The abatement was also efficient during winter.

Udawatta; Gray S. Henderson; John R. Jones; R. David Hammer,"Comparisons of runoff and sediment loss from row-crop with and without riparian buffers, pasture and grass filter strips are limited. Effects of precipitation, landuse and buffer condition on runoff and sediment loss were examined from 1997 to 1999 in eight watersheds with varying proportions of row-crop, pasture, riparian buffers and grass filter strips. Runoff volume and sediment mass from row-crop watersheds were inversely related to the percentage of forest and pasture cover. Forest (n = 2), pasture (n = 3), row-crop (n = 2) and a row-crop watershed with grass filter strips (RC-GFS) had 3‑yr mean runoff of 939, 1,560, 3,434 and 1,175 m3 ha‑1 yr‑1, respectively. Runoff was greater from all landuses in a year when precipitation was 36% above normal (1998). The largest single runoff event from each watershed accounted for 11 to 25% of its total runoff. Forest, pasture, row-crop and RC-GFS watersheds lost 1,017, 1,241, 3,679 and 2,129 kg ha‑1 yr‑1 of sediment, respectively. In 1998, the RC-GFS watershed lost more sediment than row-crop watersheds and had less runoff and sediment loss in years with normal or below normal precipitation. Row-crop watersheds with 55% pasture reduced runoff and sediment loss by 55 and 66%, respectively, compared to row-crop watersheds. During 90% of the runoff events, more soil was lost from row-crop watersheds than pasture or forest watersheds. Results suggest that 3‑4 m grass filter strips, maintenance of 55% or more pasture/CRP land within row-crop watersheds and intact riparian buffers significantly reduce runoff and sediment losses from row-crop watersheds.",19,2,137,149,Precipitation; Riparian zone; Watershed; Row crop; Pasture; Sediment; Sediment loss; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff,,,,,https://www.erudit.org/revue/rseau/2006/v19/n2/013047ar.html?vue=resume https://core.ac.uk/display/59253731 https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/rseau/2006-v19-n2-rseau1282/013047ar.pdf https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/rseau/2006-v19-n2-rseau1282/013047ar/ https://core.ac.uk/download/59253731.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/013047ar,,10.7202/013047ar,2150721438,,0,005-046-617-641-306; 005-448-995-003-661; 013-454-366-125-886; 015-514-563-181-208; 016-784-651-523-243; 023-376-887-064-38X; 025-399-937-744-493; 040-292-160-017-257; 047-315-074-139-26X; 052-578-366-355-074; 052-999-800-041-162; 055-486-051-386-205; 057-586-835-109-493; 067-204-083-755-949; 076-826-572-086-275; 077-872-665-453-904; 087-429-816-314-618; 088-017-310-971-747; 095-263-397-244-602; 097-972-089-803-438; 098-839-384-373-737; 099-957-574-025-323; 105-542-496-781-916; 109-694-017-893-653; 111-288-588-656-115; 117-573-864-788-909; 123-334-480-318-27X; 124-523-290-228-766; 130-628-009-281-409; 137-429-412-847-380; 141-101-347-131-583; 142-470-537-145-935; 153-400-209-057-384; 168-311-446-296-776; 168-710-690-179-617; 169-090-819-139-141; 183-143-735-590-924; 192-557-387-321-774,21

Surface application of aluminium (Al)-based water treatment residuals (Al-WTRs) to vegetated buffer strip (VBS) soils can enhance P removal from surface runoff during single runoff events. However, the longer-term effects on P removal in VBSs following application of products such as Al-WTR remain uncertain. We used field experimental plots to examine the long-term effects of applying a freshly generated Al-WTR to VBSs on dissolved P export during multiple runoff events, occurring between 1 day and 42 weeks after the application of Al-WTR. Vegetated buffer strip plots amended with Al-WTR significantly reduced soluble reactive P and total dissolved P concentrations in surface runoff compared to both unamended VBS plots and control plots. However, the effectiveness of Al-WTR decreased over time, by approximately 70 % after 42 weeks compared to a day following Al-WTR application. Reduced performance did not appear to be due to drying of Al-WTR in the field. Instead, the development of preferential flow paths as well as burying of Al-WTR with freshly deposited sediments may explain these observations. Better understanding of the processes controlling long-term P removal by Al-WTR is required for effective management of VBSs.",22,8,6068,6076,Environmental chemistry; Ecotoxicology; Degradation (geology); Soil water; Water treatment; Water quality; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Phosphorus; Environmental engineering,,Agriculture/methods; Aluminum/chemistry; Drinking Water/chemistry; Phosphorus/analysis; Soil Pollutants/analysis; Time Factors; Water Pollution/prevention & control; Water Purification/methods,Drinking Water; Soil Pollutants; Phosphorus; Aluminum,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25388559 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11356-014-3802-y https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/84419/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3802-y,25388559,10.1007/s11356-014-3802-y,2040350496,,0,000-320-672-752-794; 001-191-864-182-122; 002-029-193-333-233; 003-166-996-828-878; 003-888-081-454-171; 005-408-165-272-866; 006-151-482-271-918; 009-506-687-670-348; 009-925-716-397-253; 015-255-375-005-975; 017-271-112-600-695; 021-255-801-098-439; 022-382-422-089-629; 023-260-022-268-83X; 029-672-313-440-280; 030-767-219-936-084; 031-090-262-003-727; 031-920-098-255-796; 031-938-120-755-857; 033-294-497-555-726; 034-819-229-174-543; 037-125-405-274-387; 045-103-005-740-791; 045-433-715-864-07X; 046-486-845-548-951; 048-719-181-187-141; 050-633-967-024-656; 057-472-394-544-290; 066-008-497-105-394; 066-183-744-567-499; 068-843-316-009-830; 070-686-985-257-87X; 072-773-092-751-14X; 075-272-374-505-67X; 084-501-908-434-080; 086-278-743-531-248; 091-241-664-950-446; 099-389-177-966-151; 105-484-476-935-241; 106-259-976-630-538; 106-617-775-406-254; 107-350-113-427-490; 108-423-824-994-134; 125-508-267-529-721; 141-466-903-549-609; 148-468-520-956-729; 187-118-162-708-884,10

Eggenschwiler; Bernhard Speiser; Andreas Bosshard; Katja Jacot,"Most field margins on arable land in Switzerland are narrow and intensively managed. As a consequence, field margins generally harbour few plant and animal species. To enhance biodiversity in arable landscapes, sown species-rich field margins, so-called improved field margins, were introduced in 2008 as a part of the Swiss agri-environment scheme. Here, we tested whether improved field margins increase slug activity density. Slug activity density in and next to improved field margins was compared to slug activity in and next to conventional field margins. Over a period of 3 years, slugs were sampled in three regions in northern Switzerland in late spring using bait stations. Our results show that improved field margins have higher slug activity density, of +191 %, than conventional field margins, independently of the region.

Paoletti,"The majority of research on organic farming has considered arable and grassland farming systems in Central and Northern Europe, whilst only a few studies have been carried out in Mediterranean agro-systems, such as vineyards, despite their economic importance. The main aim of the study was to test whether organic farming enhances local plant species richness in both crop and non-crop areas of vineyard farms located in intensive conventional landscapes. Nine conventional and nine organic farms were selected in an intensively cultivated region (i.e. no gradient in landscape composition) in northern Italy. In each farm, vascular plants were sampled in one vineyard and in two non-crop linear habitats, grass strips and hedgerows, adjacent to vineyards and therefore potentially influenced by farming. We used linear mixed models to test the effect of farming, and species longevity (annual vs. perennial) separately for the three habitat types. In our intensive agricultural landscapes organic farming promoted local plant species richness in vineyard fields, and grassland strips while we found no effect for linear hedgerows. Differences in species richness were not associated to differences in species composition, indicating that similar plant communities were hosted in vineyard farms independently of the management type. This negative effect of conventional farming was probably due to the use of herbicides, while mechanical operations and mowing regime did not differ between organic and conventional farms. In grassland strips, and only marginally in vineyards, we found that the positive effect of organic farming was more pronounced for perennial than annual species.",49,5,1054,1060,Agriculture; Organic farming; Geography; Vineyard; Intensive farming; Ecological farming; Natural farming; Plant community; Species richness; Agroforestry; Agronomy,,Biodiversity; Italy; Organic Agriculture/methods; Poaceae/classification; Species Specificity; Trees/classification; Vitis/growth & development,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012EnMan..49.1054N/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22411057 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/22411057 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-012-9834-5 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-012-9834-5/fulltext.html https://core.ac.uk/display/53468034 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/431549,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-012-9834-5,22411057,10.1007/s00267-012-9834-5,2093357089,,0,005-206-854-207-183; 008-225-619-668-580; 021-495-377-094-561; 022-321-534-473-933; 025-803-636-956-507; 029-840-141-986-278; 032-807-208-218-884; 042-985-809-167-140; 046-007-253-381-86X; 046-523-483-093-733; 046-576-613-279-579; 047-354-052-225-572; 050-204-370-645-489; 054-274-474-416-858; 057-720-330-037-206; 060-342-609-139-480; 062-501-527-775-318; 070-556-657-787-673; 071-117-488-757-941; 075-798-739-647-141; 078-079-592-389-245; 081-187-254-788-856; 084-943-487-702-443; 086-525-130-009-786; 090-752-142-466-663; 098-035-451-831-547; 102-049-479-595-742; 105-014-981-269-239; 109-720-289-819-488; 113-927-909-193-301; 115-537-551-650-895; 115-606-139-771-296; 122-339-404-455-420; 126-661-681-059-267; 136-446-153-249-957; 137-802-632-043-010; 146-289-648-784-886; 150-827-413-891-88X; 166-388-787-602-332; 168-878-260-569-972; 176-584-522-841-048; 193-866-994-571-172,41

D. Wauchope; David D. Bosch,"Little is known about the effects of restored riparian forest buffers on transport of herbicides. The effect of a; restored riparian forest buffer system (RFBS) on transport of two herbicides, atrazine and alachlor, was studied during; 1993–1994. Herbicides were applied above a restored 3–zone riparian buffer system in April of 1993 and 1994. Bromide was; applied as a tracer with the April 1993 herbicide application. The buffer system was managed based on USDA; recommendations and averaged 38 m in width. The system included a grass buffer strip immediately adjacent to the; application area (zone 3), an area of planted pines downslope from the grass buffer (zone 2), and a narrow area of planted; hardwoods containing the stream channel system (zone 1). Most of the herbicide transport in surface runoff occurred before; June 30 with about 250 mm of cumulative rainfall after herbicide application. During this period of higher herbicide; transport, atrazine and alachlor concentrations averaging 12.7 g L –1 and 1.3 g L –1 , respectively, at the field edge were; reduced to 0.66 g L –1 and 0.06 g L –1 , respectively, as runoff neared the stream. The effect of dilution versus other; concentration reduction factors (infiltration, adsorption) was estimated for surface runoff using the bromide concentration; data. Concentration reduction was greatest per meter of flow length in the grass buffer adjacent to the field.

Megan Woltz; Rufus Isaacs; Douglas A. Landis,"Increasing evidence suggests that landscape composition is an important driver of beneficial insect populations and resulting ecosystem services. Additionally, local-scale manipulations such as planting floral strips are used at the field-level to provide resources for beneficial insects to increase their services. It has been proposed that the benefits of local manipulations will depend on the landscape context, with greater benefits in simplified landscapes and smaller benefits in landscapes with an abundance of non-crop resources. To test this, we used soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, and its coccinellid predators as a model system to elucidate the effects of habitat management and landscape on biocontrol services in soybean. We selected pairs of soybean fields in landscapes of varying composition and planted buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum, strips adjacent to one field in each pair. We measured coccinellid abundance and biocontrol in each field. Coccinellid abundance was higher in buckwheat than in control field margins in all landscapes, and coccinellid abundance in soybean was positively related to amount of semi-natural vegetation in the landscape. We found no evidence of an interaction between landscape and local variables, and biocontrol services were high in all contexts. For soybean aphid suppression, landscape factors are the key drivers of predator abundance.",152,,40,49,Vegetation; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Soybean aphid; Beneficial insects; Context (language use); Ecosystem services; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,http://news.msu.edu/media/documents/2012/05/d2b29993-2ca5-45d7-b103-d393d315e2ff.pdf https://lter.kbs.msu.edu/citations/3133 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880912000709 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880912000709,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2012.02.008,,10.1016/j.agee.2012.02.008,2158301090,,0,006-045-041-389-84X; 006-484-508-970-158; 006-610-037-754-129; 007-159-731-641-426; 008-225-619-668-580; 011-508-246-956-659; 012-267-243-122-028; 016-204-638-673-374; 017-516-181-294-137; 017-519-763-498-563; 023-569-872-250-594; 025-307-718-158-485; 026-162-389-848-750; 027-164-286-320-844; 031-114-644-626-51X; 035-553-984-833-961; 037-072-896-049-400; 040-440-119-867-809; 040-920-412-427-40X; 043-793-123-579-095; 048-430-474-757-497; 048-841-915-674-723; 050-985-622-056-969; 054-274-474-416-858; 056-892-630-404-500; 057-898-374-057-282; 059-804-606-271-839; 062-036-445-726-722; 062-501-527-775-318; 065-342-564-814-412; 066-839-397-580-750; 067-639-922-939-929; 086-402-015-642-906; 087-520-578-895-249; 089-820-647-773-411; 093-014-128-668-247; 097-847-978-381-279; 098-312-271-690-700; 104-402-912-397-497; 105-089-332-069-890; 105-581-953-753-067; 111-095-683-961-870; 113-225-847-396-026; 115-606-139-771-296; 117-493-241-761-064; 127-647-356-469-807; 129-485-035-717-367; 130-321-938-103-600; 131-367-842-764-025; 136-446-153-249-957; 137-124-485-341-72X; 148-203-562-421-657; 158-498-105-839-226; 158-897-994-681-147,150

The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of narrow grass hedges (NGHs) on reducing the transport of antimicrobials and ARGs in runoff after land application of swine manure slurry. Plot-scale rainfall simulation tests were conducted on 0.75 m by 4.0 m plots designed to test three treatment factors: manure amendment (control plots receiving no manure vs. amended plots receiving manure based on 3 times N requirement), NGH (plots with a NGH vs. plots without a NGH), and rainfall events (days 1-3). Runoff generated during three 30-min simulated rainfall events was sampled and analyzed for antimicrobials and ARGs. Manure amendment was responsible for the presence of antimicrobial tylosin ( < 0.0001) and tylosin resistance gene (B) ( < 0.0001) in runoff. Narrow grass hedges proved to be effective in reducing tylosin ( < 0.0001) and (B) ( < 0.0347) in runoff. Manure amendment was responsible for the introduction of tylosin ( < 0.0482) and (B) ( = 0.0128) into the soil; however, it had no significant impact on the abundance of the 16S rRNA gene in soil. Results from this study suggest that NGHs could be a best management practice to control the transport of antimicrobials and ARGs in agricultural runoff.",44,3,895,902,Livestock; Amendment; Tylosin; Agricultural runoff; Manure; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Pollution; Agronomy; Surface water,,,,National Pork Board,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153172566 https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1434&context=biosysengfacpub https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26024269 https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/biosysengfacpub/430/ https://core.ac.uk/display/33148442 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26024269 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2134/jeq2014.09.0389 https://core.ac.uk/download/33148442.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2014.09.0389,26024269,10.2134/jeq2014.09.0389,2030105413,,0,001-063-971-555-960; 003-232-594-172-08X; 003-273-285-045-176; 006-476-070-000-615; 007-175-002-597-437; 014-616-247-527-976; 015-938-824-665-999; 018-306-358-788-396; 020-030-335-969-079; 021-122-199-130-053; 021-378-383-335-023; 024-008-482-827-024; 026-830-960-128-391; 031-129-520-402-524; 031-276-249-846-194; 033-683-195-236-497; 033-890-182-096-159; 037-026-678-133-973; 039-319-427-113-806; 041-833-491-485-587; 044-257-811-191-083; 044-750-571-884-583; 049-504-997-493-908; 051-278-870-309-228; 055-069-035-969-315; 059-381-194-377-394; 060-998-500-698-926; 061-041-644-292-437; 063-604-325-294-67X; 067-000-755-498-128; 068-997-932-046-194; 069-115-983-163-699; 072-164-353-760-56X; 074-669-111-243-865; 085-307-530-529-703; 087-680-309-241-290; 089-882-159-175-694; 108-423-824-994-134; 116-642-958-200-723; 120-461-617-171-612; 129-263-396-750-994; 135-924-067-533-238; 138-191-599-390-980; 140-346-734-591-159; 149-850-109-330-420; 152-871-822-997-766; 166-648-088-163-172; 168-069-516-496-894; 175-302-560-900-147; 193-256-129-811-532; 197-430-645-554-460,12

Matchett; Keith Goulding; Colin P. Webster; N. E. Haycock,"The broad purpose of the study described here was to assess the role of denitrification in riparian zones in ameliorating groundwater pollution through nitrate loss, and as a potential source of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere. A suitable riparian zone was identified at Cuddesdon Mill on the River Thame floodplain near Oxford, England. Measurements were made of water and nitrate moving from arable land through the riparian zone and into the river. Techniques to measure denitrification were tested and applied, and the factors controlling denitrification measured. While there was considerable potential for denitrification at the site, this was not realized because much of the water moving off the farmland bypassed the riparian zone, entering the river directly via springs or through gravel lenses beneath the floodplain soil. Management of this site would not reduce nitrate leaching unless the floodplain hydrology could be substantially modified, and the main conclusion is that nitrate buffer zones will only operate efficiently where the hydrology of the site is appropriate.

Less well appreciated is the possibility that climate change could cause extinction by changing the ecological interactions between species. If ecologists, land managers and policy makers are to manage farmland biodiversity sustainably under global climate change, they need to understand the ways in which species interact with each other as this will affect the way they respond to climate change. Here, we consider the ability of nectar flower mixtures used in field margins to provide sufficient forage for bumble-bees under future climate change. We simulated the effect of global warming on the network of plant–pollinator interactions in two types of field margin: a four-species pollen and nectar mix and a six-species wildflower mix. While periods without flowering resources and periods with no food were rare, curtailment of the field season was very common for the bumble-bees in both mixtures. The effect of this, however, could be ameliorated by adding extra species at the start and end of the flowering season.

The importance of herbaceous, shrubby and wooded riparian habitats for the conservation of biodiversity (plants, amphibians, reptiles, birds, small mammals) is well documented for the Boyer River watershed (southern Quebec, Canada). This paper examines their conservation value for these different taxonomic groups at the watershed level and the possible effects on wildlife of various landscape modification scenarios. The overall species richness and insectivorous bird abundance in the watershed would increase markedly if there were more wooded strips in the landscape mainly due to additional plant and bird species. A scenario where all three types of riparian strips would be well-represented in the watershed is most likely to be implemented. This scenario would be the most beneficial to wildlife communities because of high native species diversity within wooded strips combined with the presence of unique species associated with each of the three types of strips. Encouraging landowners to protect existing wooded riparian habitats would be the most effective and cost-beneficial method to maintain current level of habitats distribution in the landscape, and to favour the establishment of new shrubby and wooded strips in the Boyer River watershed.",103,3,413,423,Riparian zone; Biodiversity; Wildlife conservation; Watershed; Introduced species; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Wildlife; Species richness,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880904000052 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880904000052,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2003.12.014,,10.1016/j.agee.2003.12.014,2042148947,,0,001-119-786-453-188; 004-807-568-531-692; 010-005-782-767-308; 011-919-119-768-782; 015-863-314-524-72X; 020-360-071-779-440; 021-933-813-475-043; 024-497-656-423-856; 028-510-934-918-189; 031-712-522-366-166; 036-722-726-289-60X; 038-286-684-488-655; 039-208-787-164-04X; 043-062-864-287-955; 046-595-945-408-676; 047-800-573-929-302; 051-022-262-033-206; 060-306-751-394-513; 060-819-730-330-813; 063-003-550-683-547; 063-435-224-985-32X; 071-601-864-758-089; 076-024-864-231-820; 076-377-649-956-283; 084-744-111-694-770; 088-179-459-836-289; 090-434-065-856-305; 091-777-696-122-819; 104-230-077-662-702; 104-784-237-651-91X; 105-145-742-902-746; 108-007-092-968-56X; 109-486-533-700-153; 110-612-930-963-74X; 111-734-210-139-21X; 113-900-387-576-996; 114-537-516-364-782; 116-313-159-599-128; 119-209-557-350-650; 129-795-413-211-042; 131-890-915-002-520; 143-749-787-569-284; 145-199-506-693-553; 146-589-148-444-417; 158-345-384-701-811; 162-036-968-104-223; 169-637-192-822-911; 170-230-483-322-002; 175-669-428-011-95X; 176-481-005-284-747; 179-599-537-784-673; 180-440-450-858-597,41

Leather; Felix L. Wäckers,"Insect predators and parasitoids act as biological pest control agents in agro-ecosystems, and thus provide valuable ecosystem services. These natural enemies of pest species often need a greater diversity of resources than the crops themselves provide. In intensive farm management the numbers of these beneficial arthropod species may be constrained by a lack of additional prey, floral resources or suitable overwintering sites. While previous studies have indicated that targeted field margin management can positively influence the population dynamics of beneficial insects, the relative contribution of the various resources provided by these targeted margins remains unclear.; ; To help optimise field margins for conservation biological control, this study assessed the relative contribution of three key resources; aphid prey, floral resources, and grass overwintering sites, in supporting natural enemies of cereal aphids within an agricultural landscape. Trial plots were managed adjacent to wheat fields within agro-ecosystems in the UK to assess the relative importance of these three resources in isolation and in combination. The abundance of aphidophagous natural enemies was monitored with respect to these resources during two periods; prior to cereal aphid infestation in the crop, and during the infestation period. In addition, the abundance of cereal aphids and natural enemies was monitored in the crop next to the trial plots during the infestation period. The results show that resource needs of natural enemies vary both over time and between natural enemy groups. Some predators benefited from higher aphid abundance, particularly in combination with the availability of floral resources. Floral resources had the greatest individual effect in increasing natural enemy abundance, both prior to and during periods of aphid infestation. Grassy overwintering habitat provided little overall benefit during the two study periods.; ; In the UK, most non-crop habitat in agro-ecosystems is grass dominated winter habitat. Few Stewardship scheme initiatives are designed to provide suitable floral resources targeting natural enemies of crop pests, or to provide suitable additional prey. Given the importance of floral resources to the majority of natural enemies, providing suitable nectar and pollen sources represents the greatest opportunity for enhancing naturally occurring predators and parasitoids in agro-ecosystems.",199,,94,104,Biological pest control; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Overwintering; Aphid; Beneficial insects; Population; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880914004320 https://core.ac.uk/display/76955309 https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/74043,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2014.08.024,,10.1016/j.agee.2014.08.024,2051505071,,0,001-738-641-632-786; 003-815-496-301-575; 005-650-731-676-060; 008-608-775-518-291; 009-172-624-760-904; 009-976-066-518-534; 010-225-312-935-498; 012-241-644-554-168; 013-689-681-967-801; 015-433-009-233-539; 015-578-334-267-852; 016-052-929-723-298; 019-306-319-061-086; 021-456-573-673-200; 023-269-484-535-446; 023-629-509-871-048; 025-162-529-099-143; 026-487-750-270-837; 027-164-254-872-513; 027-423-194-423-241; 031-363-532-777-337; 031-906-714-715-573; 032-225-968-310-157; 034-252-039-111-82X; 034-801-221-907-575; 038-442-778-043-35X; 039-329-972-073-773; 039-852-919-577-151; 042-063-668-748-855; 042-195-189-711-603; 042-303-914-852-499; 044-390-218-297-920; 046-907-142-498-727; 047-367-958-846-378; 055-875-196-470-917; 056-892-630-404-500; 058-109-438-227-132; 058-631-826-466-815; 060-824-929-767-162; 062-762-365-384-650; 066-062-635-092-411; 066-839-397-580-750; 067-111-699-590-086; 068-730-938-041-13X; 069-844-606-925-045; 069-901-245-663-534; 070-573-740-499-634; 073-797-947-467-295; 077-532-222-012-842; 080-139-567-968-521; 082-183-032-830-447; 082-936-178-876-142; 083-110-500-875-419; 083-412-860-749-866; 084-265-152-429-369; 089-820-647-773-411; 092-272-834-874-705; 093-271-491-167-620; 094-301-920-280-877; 094-645-205-628-669; 095-662-270-254-510; 095-982-283-440-77X; 099-921-237-201-045; 101-256-219-333-506; 104-230-077-662-702; 105-581-953-753-067; 111-393-232-083-162; 111-596-480-904-29X; 113-365-099-387-283; 115-157-919-192-948; 117-493-241-761-064; 124-991-553-281-188; 126-252-970-287-04X; 132-775-784-488-585; 135-366-554-013-471; 138-410-158-813-551; 141-759-936-693-745; 146-777-775-948-727; 150-104-334-894-282; 160-075-943-421-58X; 161-918-823-269-076; 162-333-048-007-376; 165-627-368-251-055; 169-284-432-356-331; 171-504-783-181-426; 172-555-092-221-552; 172-814-760-064-673; 184-052-512-428-666; 192-182-455-331-555; 195-286-964-251-743; 195-855-831-685-350,76

Huusela-Veistola,": The effects of cultivation methods, pesticide use and perennial grass strips on spider fauna of cereal fields were studied in a large-scale field experiment. The effects of two pesticide regimes (conventional and reduced) on spiders were contrasted with effects of two types of cultivation systems (customary and integrated farming practice). The plots under the conventional pesticide regime were sprayed with herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and growth regulators annually. The plots on reduced pesticide regime were treated only when the control thresholds were exceeded (in 1992 with insecticide and in 1994 with herbicide). The perennial grass strips (sown with a mixture of timothy, meadow fescue, red clover and white clover) at the margins of the treated plots provided an additional element. Seasonal patterns of spider catches were quite synchronous in the field and in the perennial strip. Number of spiders were clearly higher in perennial strips than in the field. Furthermore, the composition of spider fauna differed between cerela plots and perennial grass strips. Lycosidae dominated in grass strips, whereas in cereal fields the family Linyphiidae was common. The dominance of Lycosidae in grass strips increased from year to year. The perennial strips affected the spider abundance of the field; total spider catches and Lycosidae catches, but not Linyphiidae, in pitfalls near the strips were higher than in pitfalls situated further away. However, the effects of pesticide treatments on spider numbers did not depend on the distance from the perennial strip. Reduced pesticide use plots had greater total spider catches than conventional plots in 1992 and 1994. In both years the difference was obvious for more than 3 weeks after insecticide (dimethoate) treatment. In 1992, pirimicarb was nearly harmless to spiders compared to dimethoate. In 1994, the dimethoate treatment (in June) did not decrease clearly the abundance of spiders, but deltamethrin treatment (in July) had dramatic effects on the total spider abundance and the difference was still obvious in the last sampling period. At family level, the effects of pesticide treatments varied between families. Statistically significant differences between pesticide treatments were found in all years in Linyphiidae numbers, but in Lycosidae only in 1994. During the period of 3 years, no differences were found in the numbers of spiders between the two cultivation systems tested.",122,1-5,575,583,Pesticide; Perennial plant; Red Clover; Linyphiidae; Dimethoate; Spider; Pirimicarb; Botany; Agronomy; Field experiment; Biology,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0418.1998.tb01548.x https://eurekamag.com/research/003/120/003120105.php,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.1998.tb01548.x,,10.1111/j.1439-0418.1998.tb01548.x,2164100502,,0,008-608-775-518-291; 012-957-390-358-741; 014-332-067-655-642; 015-888-533-237-30X; 019-525-194-632-85X; 022-041-044-419-946; 027-023-964-826-432; 030-652-847-337-20X; 033-145-570-790-134; 033-797-072-560-76X; 035-512-326-342-385; 038-445-105-507-360; 038-660-521-275-273; 041-281-305-731-551; 047-711-433-977-172; 048-787-364-927-805; 063-714-053-560-07X; 064-338-086-975-394; 072-817-046-222-302; 074-811-254-859-725; 079-949-881-121-678; 086-229-373-154-965; 087-186-786-234-321; 087-506-904-720-671; 097-891-727-359-251; 101-797-752-209-310; 108-481-854-808-457; 118-409-347-010-789; 122-593-714-312-795; 122-765-477-485-788; 131-462-888-884-79X; 136-711-748-967-039; 138-845-934-876-76X; 140-120-948-871-39X; 148-628-032-380-601; 149-558-325-746-238; 154-143-746-540-082; 168-458-339-894-814; 193-784-606-708-810,30

Vegetative treatments evaluated were: (i) 20 m grass-10 m forest, (ii) 10 m grass-20 m forest, and (iii) 10 m grass-20 m maidencane (Panicum hemitomon Schuh.). During winter, spring, and summer vegetation type in riparian filterstrips did not affect survival of total and fecal coliform bacteria. Total and fecal coliform bacterial numbers were usually higher in the top 0 to 5 cm of soil than in the 5 to 15 and 15 to 30 cm soil depths in all treatments.

Surface activity, movements and activity density of abundant carabid beetles in a cereal field.",,1992,journal article,Oecologia,14321939; 00298549,Springer Verlag,Germany,Jon-Andri Lys; Wolfgang Nentwig,"The effect of strip-management on surface activity, movements and activity density of abundant carabid beetles during two vegetation periods in a cereal field was investigated using mark-recapture techniques. Significantly higher recapture rates, indicating higher activity, were found in the strip-managed area than in the control area, especially in Poecilus cupreus and also in Carabus granulatus and Pterostichus melanarius. Several observations led to the conclusion that this higher activity is generally due to a prolongation of the reproductive period in the strip-managed area. Significantly higher activity densities were found for P. cupreus, Pterostichus anthracinus, C. granulatus and Pt. melanarius in the strip-managed area than in a bordering control area. P. cupreus is greatly attracted to the strips during its migrations, as can be deduced from the high percentage of movements that contact the strips. Also, significantly more marked individuals moved from the control to the strip-managed area than vice versa. Pt. melanarius and Pt. anthracinus show less preference for the strips in their movements than P. cupreus.

In terms of additional crop production, a three-row mixed windbreak with extensive management and low cost is the most cost effective because it requires the smallest corn yield increases to break even. Using a sheltering effect of 12 windbreak heights, the required additional yield is 0.28 Mg ha""1 yr""1. A four-row spruce windbreak with intensive management and high costs is the least cost effective because it requires the largest corn yield increases that are 28 times larger than those of the mixed windbreak. Trees that grow faster and taller are more cost effective because they provide sheltering effect sooner and over larger distances allowing to break even with smaller yield increases that are more likely to be achieved. In terms of carbon sequestration, a four-row cottonwood windbreak is the most cost effective because it accumulates the greatest amounts of above and below-ground carbon that allow it to break even with a lifespan as short as 30 years. Only a cottonwood windbreak accumulates enough carbon to break even at a comparison price of $10.48 Mg""1. A higher carbon price of $32.38 Mg""1 enables a mixed windbreak to break even. Spruce windbreaks (two and four rows) require higher prices to break even. Continuous CRP payments offset a significant portion of windbreak costs and allow more windbreaks to break even and at earlier times.",,,,,Windbreak; Economics; Carbon sequestration; Carbon price; Forest management; Least cost; Cost effectiveness; Agroforestry; Yield (finance); Break-even (economics),,,,,http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/rtd/1163/ https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2162&context=rtd,http://dx.doi.org/10.31274/rtd-180813-13106,,10.31274/rtd-180813-13106,135464307,,0,005-289-669-638-72X; 007-427-330-423-549; 010-228-570-134-806; 011-794-789-241-510; 013-816-729-923-402; 015-863-314-524-72X; 021-505-518-379-277; 022-648-804-684-488; 038-356-136-783-128; 048-173-645-425-32X; 048-184-176-726-894; 057-879-278-560-124; 066-138-671-774-418; 066-225-698-235-700; 073-015-762-594-459; 075-617-462-950-192; 075-734-379-839-584; 081-678-354-805-904; 082-238-616-649-778; 082-829-096-355-681; 083-308-517-894-687; 097-000-860-202-737; 102-018-355-512-43X; 102-264-849-132-705; 102-879-160-937-846; 109-635-255-168-553; 110-307-097-266-440; 122-130-322-941-794; 124-075-813-336-971; 131-098-763-329-081; 140-284-114-704-529; 145-810-275-244-569; 157-381-237-020-84X; 173-141-013-354-979; 188-956-863-091-88X,1

The current losses in honey bee (<jats:italic>Apis mellifera</jats:italic> Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Apidae)) colonies pose a serious threat to the blueberry industry, raising interest in alternative pollinators. Abundance and diversity of native pollinators usually decreases with distance from natural habitats. In this study, we evaluated the effects of distance from wooded habitats such as windbreaks and forest borders on the presence of native pollinators in blueberry fields in Lac-St-Jean (Québec, Canada). Four treatments were compared: single-row, double-row, natural windbreaks, and forest borders. Pan-traps were placed at 5, 30, and 60 m from the windbreak or forest border. A total of 3878 native pollinators were collected and 81% were ground-nesting bees. The forest border was the only treatment with higher abundance and species richness on the periphery (5 m) of the field than at further distances, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of pollinators is favoured by habitats potentially offering more abundant and diverse nutritional resources. Our overall results reveal that native pollinators are distributed quite homogeneously in blueberry fields, suggesting that windbreaks are beneficial to native pollinator communities.</jats:p>",147,4,432,442,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.4039/tce.2014.55,,10.4039/tce.2014.55,,,0,000-890-614-606-582; 006-773-457-835-984; 008-607-629-600-460; 010-361-334-213-580; 011-033-341-259-433; 011-968-803-898-621; 012-033-161-699-147; 013-953-094-252-318; 017-435-062-399-767; 027-540-280-426-898; 031-821-944-486-945; 041-653-503-087-845; 042-518-166-908-941; 053-197-832-022-128; 057-042-471-294-193; 058-397-812-404-442; 060-466-019-008-16X; 083-081-764-574-521; 084-608-570-759-960; 095-057-247-648-84X; 131-130-924-358-439,12

Moore,"An experimental study was conducted in Tillamook, Oregon, USA, to quantify the effectiveness of edge-of-field vegetated buffers for reducing transport of fecal coliform bacteria (FCB) from agricultural fields amended with dairy cow manure. Installation of vegetated buffers on loamy soils dramatically reduced the bacterial contamination of runoff water from manure-treated pasturelands, but the size of the vegetated buffer was not an important determinant of bacterial removal efficiency. Only 10% of the runoff samples collected from treatment cells having vegetated buffers exhibited FCB concentrations >200 colony forming units (cfu)/100 mL (a common water quality standard value), and the median concentration for all cells containing vegetated buffers was only 6 cfu/100 mL. The presence of a vegetated buffer of any size, from 1 to 25 m, generally reduced the median FCB concentration in runoff by more than 99%. Results for FCB load calculations were similar. Our results suggest that where substantial FCB contamination of runoff occurs from manure-treated pasturelands, it might be disproportionately associated with specific field or management conditions, such as the presence of soils that exhibit low water infiltration and generate larger volumes of runoff or the absence of a vegetated buffer. Buffer size regulations that do not consider such differences might not be efficient or effective in reducing bacterial contamination of runoff.",40,6,958,965,Environmental chemistry; Contamination; Loam; Fecal coliform; Soil water; Cow dung; Water quality; Hydrology; Manure; Environmental science; Surface runoff,,Enterobacteriaceae; Feces/microbiology; Plants; Water Microbiology,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007EnMan..40..958S/abstract https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17786510/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-007-9012-3 http://lshs.tamu.edu/docs/lshs/end-notes/efficacy%20of%20vegetated%20buffers%20in%20preventin-1666170123/efficacy%20of%20vegetated%20buffers%20in%20preventing%20transport%20of%20fecal%20coliform%20bacteria%20from%20pasturelands.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17786510,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-007-9012-3,17786510,10.1007/s00267-007-9012-3,2153209271,,0,009-307-197-602-973; 010-635-976-044-366; 010-752-012-497-371; 013-488-393-402-880; 014-561-967-561-763; 040-507-938-290-621; 060-223-949-677-224; 068-997-932-046-194; 085-538-105-489-075; 086-873-034-193-158; 093-071-025-714-176; 096-170-440-160-791; 104-494-518-145-022; 106-543-466-817-560; 108-046-377-033-460; 109-628-958-134-741; 115-460-127-924-989; 137-686-429-789-591; 163-118-916-249-864; 169-607-559-923-667; 175-302-560-900-147; 179-408-876-157-610,32

All birds settled within the ca. 30% of the study area where the proportion of enhanced areas was highest (5.8%). At the level of the individual family group, we found a significant over-proportional use of enhanced areas throughout the year. Furthermore, when the birds used the agricultural fields, the use densities strongly declined with distance from the nearest enhanced area. Thus, the availability and spatial distribution of ecologically enhanced areas were the main determinants of the partridges’ range use. These results indicate that a framework of ecologically enhanced areas is a key habitat structure for grey partridges, and that these enhancements, even if small in proportion, were the crucial first measure to restore the research area to an appropriate grey partridge habitat and, thus, the basis for successful re-introduction in this intensively cultivated area.",124,3,373,381,Introduced species; Habitat; Ecology; Range (biology); Geography; Spatial distribution; Phasianidae; Perdix; Partridges; Grey partridge,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Beat_Naef-Daenzer/publication/222655298_Ecologically_enhanced_areas__a_key_habitat_structure_for_re-introduced_grey_partridges_Perdix_perdix/links/09e415093eaada1735000000.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320705000698,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2005.01.043,,10.1016/j.biocon.2005.01.043,1971627096,,0,020-131-452-110-549; 021-932-458-359-835; 022-667-644-785-266; 036-556-226-795-548; 037-768-879-567-930; 041-896-098-447-03X; 045-267-172-074-23X; 045-706-526-408-383; 045-712-621-878-667; 051-614-860-275-28X; 054-154-620-382-507; 061-401-711-406-024; 068-669-359-350-27X; 071-164-159-600-013; 072-208-659-152-26X; 073-428-537-366-199; 078-258-635-923-748; 098-143-627-905-764; 111-902-752-671-42X; 112-601-870-081-081; 113-066-359-815-724; 114-379-822-185-618; 114-570-828-723-726; 115-434-601-786-132; 139-542-213-906-293; 143-273-453-722-006; 144-455-119-852-490; 146-265-301-504-324; 156-066-906-763-397; 160-441-729-196-454; 164-973-282-623-749; 176-472-477-666-474; 187-274-321-545-969; 194-487-262-497-006,49

Carabid beetles were caught in pitfall traps placed 0.5 m from either a hedge or a post and wire fence in 16 grassland field margins. The data were collected over the season April-mid November 1990. The relationship of the beetle assemblages to measurements of species numbers of field margin flora, sward husbandry, sward characteristics and physical attributes of the field margin itself was investigated. Contrary to expectations most species caught did not seem to be correlated to any measured variable. The majority of species trapped were present in both the hedge and fence field margins. However, a notable percentage (29.4) were present exclusively in the hedge margins, for example, Leistus fulvibarbis and Trechus obtusus.

Yahner,"Small mammals were studied from September 1978 to November 1980 in 5 Minnesota farmstead shelterbelts. Based on correlations between habitat variables characterizing vegetative features of shelterbelts and numbers of individuals captured in each season, Peromyscus leucopus and Clethrionomys gapperi were considered as woodland species, Microtus pennsylvanicus as a grassland species, and Sorex cinereus and Blarina brevicauda as intermediate in terms of their dependency on shelterbelts. Area and perimeter of shelterbelts were associated with numbers of all species except C. gapperi. Numbers of P. leucopus and C. gapperi tended to be higher in shelterbelts that were isolated from other wooded habitat, whereas numbers of S. cinereus were lower in isolated shelterbelts. Species richness was greater in larger shelterbelts with complex vegetative structure. Species of small mammals residing in shelterbelts were those that typically are not considered as agricultural pests. Management recommendations include maintenance practices that do not reduce stratification of vegetation, leaving woody and man-made debris within shelterbelts, and establishing shelterbelts that are as large as possible within the economic constraints of farming. These recommendations simultaneously would benefit other species of mammals and birds in the intensively farmed regions of the Midwest. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 47(1):74-84 Vegetative complexity and habitat size are major determinants of the abundance of individual mammalian species and the structure of mammalian communities in natural habitats (Dueser and Shugart 1978, Dueser and Brown 1980, Geier and Best 1980). Farmstead shelterbelts are small (generally 1.5 m in depth) that prevented access to traps. Traps were opened for 2 consecutive days each session and were closed between sessions. Rolled oats mixed with small amounts of peanut butter were used as bait. I marked each captured animal with ear tags (#1, National Band and Tag Co., Newport, Ky.) or toe clips for individual recognition. Sex, age, weight, reproductive condition, and trap location were recorded for each capture. Species captured >20 times during the study were included in the analyses; these were Sorex cinereus, Blarina brevicauda, Clethrionomys gapperi, Microtus pennsylvanicus. and Peromyscus leucopus. Fifty-four habitat variables were measured for each shelterbelt during August 1979 and 1980. These included 2 dimensional, 14 proximal land-use, 27 vegetative, and 11 physical variables (Appendix). Vegetative and physical features were based on sampling methods and procedures modified from Dueser and Shugart (1978) using 3 sampling units centered on each trap: a 10-m radius plot, a 1-m2 ring, and 2 perpendicular 20-m2 transects. Species variables were derived in each of the 9 seasons (autumn 1978, winter 1979, etc.) for the 5 species of small mammals. These variables consisted of the total number of individuals (all age-sex classes combined) and the total number of indiJ. Wildl.

In addition, species richness (S), or the total number of different species of small mammals captured, was determined per shelterbelt for the entire study period and for each season. Relationships between the 54 habitat variables and the species variables were examined. As a result of small sample size (N = 5 shelterbelts) and multicollinearity (Chatterjee and Price 1977) among habitat variables, simple correlation analyses were used (Sokal and Rohlf 1969). Both untransformed and log-transformed data were analyzed (after Dueser and Brown 1980). Throughout the text, significant correlations (P < 0.05) were based on product-moment correlation coefficients (r) ?0.878 and df = 3.

Semi-natural vegetation and diverse cropping systems have been converted into monocultures with low tree densities, leaving the soil unprotected. We evaluated the association in soil- and water-conservation systems with production in traditional almond orchards and the beneficial impact of plant strips in mountainous agriculture. Soil loss, runoff and nutrient loss over a four-year period (2002–2005) were monitored in hillside erosion plots with almond trees under different soil-management systems: (1) non-tillage with sage (Salvia lavandulifolia L. subspecies Oxyodon) strips 3 m wide; (2) non-tillage with rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) strips, (3) non-tillage with thyme (Thymus baeticus L. Boiss. exlacaita) strips, and (4) conventional tillage on the south flank of the Sierra Nevada (Lanjaron) in south-eastern Spain. Also, the nut yield from almond trees, and the biomass from aromatic-shrub strips were measured. The erosion plots, located on a 35% slope, were 144 m2 in area. The plant-cover strips, 3 m wide, ran across the slope. Our results show that the most effective treatment proved to be non-tillage with thyme strips, reducing the annual soil loss by 93% and runoff by 80%, with respect to conventional tillage. Non-tillage with rosemary strips reduced soil loss by 91 % and runoff by 82%, with respect to conventional tillage, while these percentages were 69% and 51%, respectively, for non-tillage with sage strips. In addition, all the treatments as a whole, in comparison with conventional tillage, revealed that the plant strips were the decisive factor in the reduction of NPK losses by surface runoff. The average nut yield from non-tillage with sage strips, non-tillage with rosemary strips, non-tillage with thyme strips and conventional tillage during the study period was 2.4, 3.2, 3.8 and 4.5 kg tree−1, respectively, and the essential oil yield from sage, rosemary and thyme strips was 5.0, 8.7 and 10.8 L ha−1, respectively. The non-tillage with thyme strips decreased nutrient loading in surface waters and thus had a positive impact on the environment while simultaneously maintaining reasonable almond-production levels. Thus, the combination of orchard trees with shrubs provided a viable option to conserve soil and water in hilly areas with opportunities to increase overall land productivity as well as sustainable agro-environmental measures.",28,4,497,505,Erosion; Monoculture; Vegetation; Ecology; Soil quality; Salvia lavandulifolia; Conventional tillage; Orchard; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Agronomy,,,,,https://www.agronomy-journal.org/articles/agro/pdf/2008/04/a7212.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1051/agro%3A2008020 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00886462/document http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/agro:2008020 https://dx.doi.org/10.1051/agro:2008020 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00886462 https://rd.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1051%2Fagro%3A2008020.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/agro:2008020,,10.1051/agro:2008020,1975555965,,0,000-550-242-915-286; 003-630-309-310-353; 003-730-166-192-529; 004-239-815-184-200; 014-331-710-973-275; 023-145-818-979-019; 027-430-314-450-435; 028-034-500-501-517; 034-946-583-952-83X; 036-498-767-059-823; 038-799-995-387-011; 040-313-510-158-034; 040-784-855-109-386; 041-451-335-230-183; 041-956-308-021-638; 042-998-407-701-227; 044-820-250-067-153; 047-689-880-239-819; 051-357-304-178-29X; 056-237-951-331-786; 057-772-080-438-860; 059-751-194-635-483; 062-674-858-639-324; 064-995-738-937-503; 069-927-558-950-628; 072-317-138-666-604; 074-086-048-887-232; 075-826-877-292-110; 076-286-192-272-290; 076-863-314-595-731; 078-957-886-151-589; 081-098-412-792-638; 084-212-592-803-466; 085-202-543-323-156; 086-812-760-777-597; 087-360-681-728-49X; 088-048-841-192-621; 088-465-171-238-228; 089-814-797-296-12X; 091-084-700-225-465; 097-606-668-251-99X; 101-254-834-335-141; 106-153-659-278-782; 117-860-348-832-477; 122-366-019-593-740; 124-334-470-681-725; 128-052-928-327-315; 132-233-286-245-058; 141-101-347-131-583; 147-835-879-637-252; 150-984-861-982-282; 164-821-291-483-482; 165-184-942-341-398; 165-299-427-858-800; 166-648-088-163-172; 169-607-559-923-667; 172-803-529-358-122; 175-231-710-696-191; 191-753-572-738-485; 193-256-129-811-532,26

The STRIPs (Science-based Trials of Row crops Integrated with Prairies) project is a watershedscale experiment at the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge, in Jasper County, Iowa, US, in which strips of prairie vegetation were planted within watersheds of corn (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max) production to aid in soil and water conservation. The project includes 12 0.5to 3.2-ha watersheds. Nine watersheds included buffer strips in one of three design treatments that varied the number and position of strips and/or the proportion of the watershed converted to buffer and three watersheds were 100% crop. The present study investigated: (1) If the design of prairie buffer strips influenced their vegetation; (2) If the vegetation of prairie buffer strips shifted over time; (3) If prairie buffer strips caused a weed problem in adjacent crop fields. From 2008-2011, the identity and percent cover of plant species within the buffer strips were surveyed, and from 2009-2011, the identity and percent cover of weed species within the cropped areas of the watersheds were surveyed. Differences among treatments and among years in plant species diversity, percent cover, and composition were analyzed using ANOVA and NMS. The design of buffer strips did not influence plant species diversity or composition; however, buffer strip vegetation did shift over time. In 2008, the strips had 38 species (in 6 m) with 37% of the total plant cover composed of perennial species and 22% composed of native perennial species. By 2011, the strips had 55 species (in 6 m) with 90% of the total plant cover composed of perennial species and 58% composed of native perennial species. In addition, NMS analyses indicated that the buffer strip plant community shifted from annual to perennial species. Within the crop, weed species richness and percent cover did not differ among watershed treatments, regardless of whether watersheds contained buffer strips or not. Prairie buffer strips greatly increased plant diversity in the watersheds; 380% more species were found in 6 m of prairie buffer than in 6 m of cropland. Within four years of establishment, the buffer strip vegetation was predominantly perennial and native species, the target vegetation for both ecohydrological functions (i.e., erosion control) and for conservation. Furthermore, weed species richness or prevalence did not differ between watersheds that incorporated prairie buffer strips versus",,,,,Monoculture; Vegetation; Plant cover; Geography; Perennial plant; Weed; Buffer strip; Plant community; Species richness; Agronomy,,,,,https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/12343/ https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3350&context=etd,http://dx.doi.org/10.31274/etd-180810-2177,,10.31274/etd-180810-2177,135550839,,0,000-669-594-539-024; 002-515-531-907-513; 004-724-454-913-63X; 005-716-437-736-789; 006-255-253-311-118; 007-571-395-247-941; 009-256-582-324-853; 011-508-246-956-659; 012-335-108-074-344; 013-738-740-075-669; 014-806-611-940-810; 016-539-777-323-264; 017-114-303-050-420; 019-622-915-734-27X; 023-969-777-620-975; 024-125-558-121-048; 030-682-084-703-597; 031-594-381-687-040; 031-858-853-815-220; 040-522-094-350-30X; 042-985-809-167-140; 043-463-611-459-20X; 043-890-816-980-193; 047-946-954-821-823; 050-111-828-089-427; 050-948-394-739-14X; 052-987-325-921-233; 055-175-430-005-056; 056-220-117-383-292; 056-789-845-462-569; 057-001-477-328-971; 059-381-194-377-394; 063-141-893-182-571; 063-601-662-017-83X; 068-452-604-669-157; 070-239-213-610-528; 073-021-383-708-605; 075-182-328-430-399; 076-377-649-956-283; 095-104-916-898-838; 098-771-071-890-612; 099-050-643-792-089; 102-741-113-454-268; 103-150-198-998-177; 105-209-607-529-360; 107-276-487-476-921; 116-107-788-812-414; 120-779-030-824-688; 121-217-654-127-428; 131-060-331-668-772; 132-380-117-709-640; 137-714-153-495-730; 139-252-034-774-242; 140-372-681-864-027; 145-068-815-411-652; 149-367-063-545-839; 160-814-066-258-368; 165-977-277-915-055; 168-878-260-569-972; 181-891-996-888-404,3

Baret; Thierry Hance,"Biological control of cereal aphids was attempted during two years, using two approaches: (1) mass-release of Aphidius rhopalosiphi (21,000 individuals/ha) in May and (2) use of a clover-ryegrass strip as a parasitoid reservoir. Two aphid species (Metopolophium festucae and Acyrtosiphon pisum) considered as alternative hosts for cereal aphid parasitoids occurred in the grassy strips. Three fields for each of the mass release or strip management were compared in 2000 with two control fields where no aphid control was done. Aphid population growth was significantly reduced under both mass release and management compared to controls. There was no significant difference between the two treatments. Yet, the parasitism rates were significantly higher under mass release and strip management than in the controls. In 2001, three fields per treatment were compared with three controls. Aphid numbers were very low in all fields, strip management being the only treatment to slow down aphid population growth. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Young and old, sown and naturally developed field margin strips were compared and differences to large fallows established. The five types of field margin strips (around cereal fields) were: (1, 2) 1- or 6-year-old naturally developed strips, (3) strips sown with a Phacelia mixture, (4) strips sown with a mixture of 19 wild flower species, and (5) strips sown with winter wheat or oat as a control. The naturally developed vegetation of the field margin strips was dominated by aggressive weeds, presumably due to the intensive farming practices and the fertile soils. Cirsium arvense populations decreased, while Elymus repens populations increased with age of habitat. Sowings were suitable to suppress these aggressive weeds. Potted plants of mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) and red clover (Trifolium pratense) were exposed in the field margin strips to study arthropod colonization of these experimentally standardized plant patches. Arthropod species richness did not differ between field margin types, reflecting the overall similarity in floristic diversity, but sprayed and strip-free edges of cereal fields had a reduced diversity. Dispersal of insect populations of red clover into the cereal fields decreased with increasing distance, but benefited from adjacent field margin strips. Populations of predators (mainly spiders) as well as predator-prey ratios were significantly larger in 6-year-old than in 1-year-old strips emphasizing the importance of habitat age for natural enemies and possible biological control. Predator-prey ratios were also higher on old than young fallows. Large fallows had greater predator-prey ratios than small field margin strips emphasizing the trophic-level hypothesis of island biogeography in that the relative importance of natural enemies increased with habitat area.

Bright; Antony J. Morris; Rob H. Field; Andrew I. Cooke; Philip V. Grice; Leila K. Walker; Jeremy Fern; Will J. Peach,"Agri-environment schemes (AES) are the main policy mechanism available to reverse the widespread losses of farmland biodiversity across Europe. Previous examples of AES enhancing the abundance of farmland birds have been restricted to targeted species recovery programmes, often with bespoke habitat management and high levels of advisory support for landowners. Here, we tested whether standard higher-tier AES agreements targeted at multiple species and with lower levels of advisory support than targeted species recovery programmes can enhance the breeding densities of farmland birds. Surveys of breeding birds were undertaken during 2008 and 2011 on 65 farms under higher level stewardship (HLS) and 21 farms lacking AES interventions, in three regions of England. After allowing for any impacts of predator control, changes in density were more positive on HLS farms in at least one region for six priority species. Five of the six species had mixed diets and were predominantly associated with field edges; the other (lapwing) probably responded to the provision of field-centre fallow plots. Changes in bird numbers were not consistently related to the extent of AES habitat provision. This is the first study to demonstrate that standard AES management without substantial ongoing advisory support can increase or maintain the densities of widespread declining species.",203,,69,79,Agriculture; Biodiversity; Habitat; Ecology; Population density; Animal breeding; Geography; Lapwing; Agricultural land; Agroforestry; Abundance (ecology),,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880915000225 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880915000225 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153136255 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5324337,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2015.01.021,,10.1016/j.agee.2015.01.021,1990986474,,0,000-634-929-497-517; 002-262-285-007-84X; 004-367-332-738-009; 007-194-033-627-161; 008-225-619-668-580; 014-902-807-113-93X; 016-080-943-476-05X; 016-421-756-148-512; 019-561-810-281-087; 021-287-592-996-975; 031-592-787-048-258; 032-390-963-080-355; 036-117-863-979-556; 038-255-983-206-134; 042-082-544-198-293; 045-455-587-148-315; 047-667-611-430-765; 050-261-844-716-21X; 056-929-681-275-75X; 059-190-174-946-99X; 072-023-041-620-155; 073-990-815-488-726; 074-793-529-288-006; 075-168-083-087-797; 075-853-168-113-224; 086-214-048-634-584; 096-101-436-780-075; 102-694-489-949-18X; 108-367-697-659-208; 120-993-169-075-447; 124-319-214-482-940; 125-995-631-935-63X; 127-529-232-992-594; 134-664-214-931-806; 136-446-153-249-957; 141-005-140-982-524; 159-938-497-832-818; 165-804-108-473-473,39

Whittingham; Ruth D. Swetnam; Jeremy D. Wilson; Dan E. Chamberlain; Robert P. Freckleton,"Summary 1. Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella populations have declined rapidly in the UK over recent decades, and a clear understanding of their habitat requirements is important to help inform conservation schemes. We aimed to disentangle and rank the effects of winter versus breeding season habitat characteristics. 2. We used information theoretic methods to analyse the factors determining yellowhammer distribution across 26 sites in England and Wales. We did this at two spatial levels: individual field boundaries and individual territories, the latter consisting of spatial clusters of boundaries. 3. We considered the role of nine predictor variables, all of which have been suggested in the literature as potentially important. These comprised boundary height and width, and the presence of hedges, trees, ditches, boundary strips, tillage crops, winter set-aside and winter stubbles. 4. The results of the statistical modelling showed that winter habitats play an important role in determining where birds locate territories in summer. In particular, the presence of rotational set-aside fields in winter showed the strongest association with summer territories. 5. There were minor differences between the territory- and boundary-based models. Most notably, the territory data demonstrated a strong preference for territories containing trees, but this was not observed in the boundary data set. We suggest that the differences between the models may reflect different scales of habitat selection. Boundary occupancy reflects broad distributions of habitat suitability; territory occupancy patterns better reveal detailed habitat requirements. 6. Regional densities were more closely correlated with the predictions of the boundarybased model than those of the territory-based model, and we discuss the implications of this for interpreting habitat association models. 7. Synthesis and applications. Provision of winter set-aside fields for summer territory selection by yellowhammers is an important consideration for farm management where conservation is a priority. We show that models based on occupancy of individual boundary units (e.g. hedgerows) correlate with the density of territories at the farm scale; thus farm management practices link directly to population sizes through effects on the quality of breeding habitat.",42,2,270,280,Ecosystem; Occupancy; Habitat; Ecology; Metapopulation; Geography; Emberizidae; Population; Yellowhammer; Emberiza citrinella,,,,,https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/70386 http://www.avibirds.com/pdf/G/Geelgors5.pdf http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01007.x/full https://iris.unito.it/handle/2318/125492 https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/file_store/production/56363/E88B4220-DA5D-4E4F-84C7-69A990FF9897.pdf https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01007.x https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/301900730.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01007.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01007.x,1661169526,,0,002-234-862-186-238; 003-523-629-064-477; 004-010-787-386-28X; 004-367-332-738-009; 006-174-981-795-443; 008-414-929-791-157; 011-305-198-094-715; 013-663-932-641-262; 014-335-179-532-157; 017-708-454-247-712; 020-167-621-399-502; 021-419-559-384-303; 029-705-760-353-953; 030-831-977-852-027; 031-592-787-048-258; 031-706-636-786-651; 032-245-730-539-873; 036-462-220-855-768; 036-556-226-795-548; 045-640-805-432-475; 046-462-915-703-966; 048-465-576-777-042; 053-191-268-007-391; 064-454-510-982-621; 066-596-627-924-034; 068-669-359-350-27X; 068-896-840-083-964; 071-601-656-233-384; 071-720-382-141-598; 072-224-176-896-782; 073-798-803-161-275; 074-197-517-203-385; 074-858-215-592-675; 077-142-531-895-649; 079-261-909-912-581; 081-184-406-382-06X; 088-099-886-225-087; 091-415-969-356-605; 093-431-710-793-083; 096-074-282-606-638; 097-681-694-700-322; 098-498-632-504-327; 104-762-500-201-442; 110-766-047-364-379; 111-728-793-696-876; 112-215-225-829-127; 114-788-294-317-652; 117-600-140-662-332; 119-209-557-350-650; 123-454-948-311-636; 143-250-679-860-16X; 145-728-200-767-581; 156-769-280-292-837; 157-952-430-903-966; 160-397-778-425-713,173

Komor; Joseph A. Magner,"This study evaluates processes that affect nitrate concentrations in groundwater beneath riparian zones in an agricultural watershed. Nitrate pathways in the upper 2 m of groundwater were investigated beneath wooded and grass-shrub riparian zones next to cultivated fields. Because trees can be important components of the overall nitrate pathway in wooded riparian zones, water sources used by riparian trees and possible effects of trees on nitrate concentrations in groundwater were also investigated. Average nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater beneath the cultivated fields were 5.5 mg/L upgradient of the wooded riparian zone and 3.5 mg/L upgradient of the grass-shrub zone. Shallow groundwater beneath the fields passed through the riparian zones and discharged into streams that had average nitrate concentrations of 8.5 mg/L (as N). Lateral variations of δD values in groundwater showed that mixing among different water sources occurred beneath the riparian zones. In the wooded riparian zone, nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater were diluted by upwelling, nitrate-poor, deep groundwater. Upwelling deep groundwater contained ammonium with a δ15N of 5‰ that upon nitrification and mixing with nitrate in shallow groundwater caused nitrate δ15N values in shallow groundwater to decrease by as much as 19.5‰. Stream water penetrated laterally beneath the wooded riparian zone as far as 19 m from the stream's edge and beneath the grass-shrub zone as far as 27 m from the stream's edge. Nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater immediately upgradient of where it mixed with stream water averaged 0.4 mg/L in the wooded riparian zone and 0.8 mg/L near the grass-shrub riparian zone. Nitrate concentrations increased toward the streams because of mixing with nitrate-rich stream water. Because nitrate concentrations were larger in stream water than shallow groundwater, concentrated nitrate in the streams cannot have come from shallow groundwater at these sites. Water sources of riparian trees were identified by comparing δD values of sap water, soil water, groundwater, and stream water. Soil water was the main water source for trees in the outer 4 to 6 m of one part of the wooded riparian zone and outer 10 m of another part. Groundwater was a significant water source for trees closer to the streams where the water table was less than about 2.1 to 2.7 m below the surface. No evidence was found in the nitrate concentration profiles that trees close to the streams that took up groundwater through their roots also took up nitrate from groundwater. The lack of such evidence is attributed to the nitrate concentration profiles being insufficiently sensitive indicators of nitrate removal by trees.",32,4,1039,1050,Riparian zone; Geology; Groundwater flow; Riparian forest; Soil water; Groundwater recharge; Nitrate; Hydrology; Water table; Groundwater,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996WRR....32.1039K/abstract https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/95WR03815 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/95WR03815/full http://doi.wiley.com/10.1029/95WR03815 https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70170925 https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/nitrate-in-groundwater-and-water-sources-used-by-riparian-trees-i,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/95wr03815,,10.1029/95wr03815,2098391642,,0,002-517-421-135-937; 002-937-270-631-538; 003-261-661-694-180; 006-036-573-934-234; 008-673-175-457-633; 012-899-875-361-698; 015-845-007-122-254; 017-462-329-161-146; 018-859-894-068-595; 031-242-683-380-192; 038-659-320-814-260; 046-008-989-596-85X; 050-989-784-672-519; 053-093-567-362-36X; 068-308-610-693-130; 075-283-748-830-527; 076-793-963-794-895; 079-961-989-935-966; 082-845-963-965-366; 083-547-733-666-951; 083-963-827-207-580; 103-186-016-967-957; 103-382-458-906-48X; 111-435-647-398-863; 113-957-143-269-073; 125-598-163-392-582; 129-339-977-188-475; 132-186-585-542-192; 138-762-735-726-300; 143-071-949-348-067; 143-446-554-315-090; 145-923-048-358-751; 150-539-908-471-485; 160-168-937-811-306,35

Mullet; Karen D. Gruen,"We investigated the effect of agricultural buffer strips on survival and home range estimates of pen-raised northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) at Tudor Farms on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. In September 2000 we released groups of bobwhites into 9 buffer strip (treatment) areas and 9 non-buffer strip (control) areas among 11 agricultural farms. Each group consisted of 4 radiomarked bobwhites and 26 non-radiomarked bobwhites. To maintain contact with the established coveys, additional radiomarked bobwhites (n 177) were introduced into the coveys as radiomarked birds died. Survival for bobwhites released in buffer strip areas was lower (P 0.001) than survival in non-buffer strip areas. None of the radiomarked bobwhites released in the buffer strip areas survived past 27 weeks, whereas 11% of radiomarked bobwhites in non-buffer strip areas survived to 27 weeks and 1 bird survived to 41 weeks. Predation was the primary mortality factor (88%), followed by unknown causes (7%), stress (2%), hunting (2%), and road kill (1%). Mean fall and winter home range (95% minimum convex polygon) for 21 bobwhite coveys was 24.2 3.5 ha, ranging from 1.7 to 65.8 ha. Home range areas of bobwhite coveys in buffer strips (n 12, x 15.0 2.7 ha) was significantly smaller (P 0.002) than non-buffer strip coveys (n 9, x 36.4 4.9 ha). We conclude that the smaller home ranges in buffer strip areas seem to indicate better habitat quality; however, high mortality rates of pen-raised bobwhites limited our ability to confirm this.

Jarvis; Hannah Fielder; Nigel Maxted; Simon M. Smart,"Many crop species suffer from a lack of genetic diversity which reduces the ability of cultivars to withstand new pests or environmental stresses. The wild relatives of crop plants are an important source of genetic variation and can be used to introduce new traits into existing crops. Identification and conservation of crop wild relatives (CWR) is, therefore, an important step to safeguard future food security. Recent efforts have identified geographical hotspots of CWR diversity in several countries but, as yet, there have been no surveys to identify the habitats and landscape features within these areas that might be most suitable for conservation efforts. Here, we use a UK-wide vegetation survey covering a range of both habitats and landscape features (e.g. fields, hedgerows, waterways and roadsides) to identify the habitats and features with the highest proportion of CWR identified as priority taxa for conservation. Priority CWR were most abundant in grassland habitats, although this was most striking in CWR related to forage and fodder crops. CWR related to food crops were most common in cropped and weedy areas, fertile grassland and lowland woodland. Within habitats, CWR occurrence was significantly associated with linear features including hedgerows, roadsides, field boundaries and field margins. Our findings indicate that CWR of conservation interest are often associated with disturbed habitats and landscape features that are not considered as priorities under site-based conservation measures. We suggest that efforts to maintain linear features in hotspots of CWR diversity would be most effective at conserving the UK's CWR resource.",191,,444,451,Agriculture; Resource (biology); Vegetation; Habitat; Ecology; Range (biology); Woodland; Geography; Grassland; Agroforestry; Food security,,,,,https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/distribution-of-crop-wild-relatives-of-conservation-priority-in-the-uk-landscape(00f4fc57-055f-4fe0-a846-5e6721d7945e).html https://core.ac.uk/display/33453080 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632071530046X https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632071530046X https://core.ac.uk/download/33453080.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2015.07.039,,10.1016/j.biocon.2015.07.039,1072819144,,0,000-089-017-499-324; 000-103-713-547-965; 001-362-855-145-788; 003-803-365-367-189; 005-400-528-310-627; 009-067-499-774-121; 010-225-312-935-498; 010-258-981-642-693; 012-187-317-384-830; 020-715-514-086-978; 029-892-516-732-245; 032-092-568-630-622; 043-092-532-269-854; 043-915-956-408-584; 047-049-258-765-792; 047-546-677-833-03X; 047-733-221-799-180; 048-730-712-854-60X; 053-811-972-418-973; 055-360-809-811-970; 055-675-734-683-13X; 056-391-120-745-502; 056-789-845-462-569; 061-737-537-260-97X; 063-828-102-408-126; 070-365-342-030-594; 073-155-361-098-782; 082-395-769-409-416; 092-439-066-619-681; 098-622-173-826-196; 117-345-687-903-78X; 132-572-293-438-348; 146-591-253-297-028; 150-325-162-873-23X; 164-519-333-127-754; 166-682-614-885-036; 180-157-128-386-145; 188-475-265-660-82X,45

In the policy context buffer strips are referred to as land with defined farming restrictions aiming at protecting the water course. In the current EU agricultural policy framework the majority of the decisions regarding subsidy schemes for buffer strips is taken on the member country level, which results in great differences between the EU members with regard to this water protection measure. If incentives for farmers for establishing and maintaining buffer strips are in place, they are usually linked to the harvest ban on the buffer strip. Such protection model can be endangered by volatile and rising prices for agricultural products. However, buffer strip can represent a valuable source of different ecosystem services, including biomass provision. If harvesting under certain restrictions would be allowed, the biomass could generate additional revenue that might contribute to securing buffer strips existence and consequently maintaining their protection function. This study aimed at assessing the costs and environmental consequences of biomass mobilizing from buffer strips. It dealt with different scenarios of biomass sourcing from extensively cultivated buffer strips in the Netherlands. In 12 scenarios, the cultivation of grass or cereal mixes (including multiple harvesting or perennial cultivation) for different valorisation chains (ensiling or fodder & bedding) was assessed. Both total net cultivation costs as well as the hectare based environmental performance (using the Life Cycle Assessment methodology) were evaluated. Additionally, the environmental impact of electricity production through anaerobic digestion of biomass from buffer strips was compared with the impact from digestion of classic grass silage and the impact profile of Dutch electricity mix. The results indicate ensiling as the scenario generating more net costs and higher environmental impacts as compared to fodder & bedding. In the latter, the cereal cultivation represents a better solution from economic perspective, while grass shows lower environmental impacts. Moreover, optimizing grass cultivation through switching to perennial mode contributes to strong improvements of the economic performance and contributes to additional reduction of environmental impacts, and consequently delivers the best environmental and economic solution. Moreover, the comparison with the Dutch electricity mix shows that biomass from buffer strips, if used in anaerobic digestion, can, in terms of environmental performance, compete with classic silages and contribute to reduced environmental damage.",57,,31,39,Agriculture; Environmental impact assessment; Hectare; Life-cycle assessment; Biomass; Context (language use); Environmental science; Buffer strip; Environmental protection; Ecosystem services; Agronomy,,,,European Commission,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901115301155,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2015.11.014,,10.1016/j.envsci.2015.11.014,2206631347,,0,000-048-563-958-611; 006-677-293-260-300; 006-962-356-363-116; 022-193-988-588-037; 038-029-852-973-098; 038-659-320-814-260; 044-537-569-855-131; 057-123-379-343-110; 063-230-432-702-460; 064-284-235-545-136; 072-894-925-030-71X; 095-237-569-744-605; 098-004-631-148-428; 107-935-859-632-582; 122-775-267-844-083; 127-777-796-113-391; 146-579-228-656-189; 146-606-352-041-123; 179-421-498-785-260,10

Nigel R. Critchley; David Allen; J.A. Fowbert; Alison C Mole; Anna L Gundrey,"The Arable Stewardship Pilot Scheme in England provided farmers with options for creating a range of habitat types on arable land. The prescribed methods of habitat establishment were derived from previous research, but the outcomes were uncertain when applied across the two large areas encompassed by the scheme. Vegetation was sampled from 294 sites representing overwinter stubble, spring fallow, undersown cereals, grass leys, wildlife seed mixtures, conservation headlands, no-fertiliser conservation headlands, sown grass margins, naturally regenerated grass margins and uncropped cultivated margins. Vegetation characteristics and differences between habitat options were broadly as predicted. Uncontrolled environmental factors accounted for more variation than habitat option at naturally regenerated sites, but not at sites with sown cover. Creation of simple habitats on arable land appears to be achievable in agri-environment schemes because the general outcomes are predictable. At a local level, potential effects of environmental factors also need to be taken into account.",119,4,429,442,Vegetation; Habitat; Range (biology); Geography; Wildlife; Grande bretagne; Royaume uni; Environmental protection; Plant community; Agroforestry; Arable land,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320704000072,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2004.01.004,,10.1016/j.biocon.2004.01.004,1986544654,,0,007-243-303-723-240; 007-416-181-403-689; 008-662-523-399-289; 011-609-084-347-705; 012-335-108-074-344; 016-573-648-664-125; 018-028-975-115-624; 020-167-621-399-502; 020-713-758-200-58X; 022-070-333-305-083; 022-994-627-626-27X; 027-419-090-777-633; 028-917-029-117-685; 029-386-831-957-40X; 035-030-695-212-090; 044-753-610-533-30X; 047-938-543-493-423; 053-551-700-281-485; 054-603-360-219-244; 056-585-869-238-25X; 056-789-845-462-569; 064-975-099-130-640; 065-071-886-701-523; 073-010-346-426-592; 082-540-198-876-114; 083-102-813-642-755; 083-714-994-906-170; 084-387-291-870-23X; 084-712-596-962-65X; 086-098-672-045-008; 087-186-786-234-321; 093-648-619-551-654; 093-797-500-508-076; 093-835-124-539-323; 108-336-813-188-908; 113-381-321-144-128; 117-345-687-903-78X; 119-915-331-790-125; 120-514-812-606-235; 122-714-007-959-82X; 124-362-582-173-520; 125-995-631-935-63X; 128-918-101-050-930; 131-823-405-892-930; 132-380-117-709-640; 133-048-738-071-733; 134-797-888-874-528; 149-200-651-727-319; 152-856-891-760-185; 165-584-596-671-935; 165-804-108-473-473; 173-125-764-405-837; 179-048-991-295-983; 184-621-408-258-203; 186-641-191-968-95X; 197-798-610-196-806,63

Fossey; Zahra Thomas; Y. Fauvel; Philippe Merot,"In many agricultural areas, hedgerows give rise to strong expectations of reducing the inputs of excess nitrate to the groundwater and rivers. This study aims to analyse the spatial and seasonal influences of a hedgerow on nitrate dynamics in the soil and groundwater. Nitrate (NO3−) and chloride (Cl−) concentrations were measured with spatially dense sampling in the unsaturated soil and in the groundwater along a transect intersecting a bottomland oak (Quercus rubor) hedgerow after the growing season and during the dormant season. We explain NO3− dynamics by using Cl− as an index of tree-root extension and water transfer. At the end of the growing season, NO3− is entirely absorbed by the trees over a large and deep volume corresponding to the rooting zone, where, in contrast Cl− is highly concentrated due to root exclusion. However, these observed patterns in the soil have no influence on the deep groundwater composition at this season. During the dormant season, water transfer processes feeding the shallow groundwater layer are different upslope and downslope from the hedgerow in relation to the thickness of the unsaturated zone. Upslope, the shallow groundwater is fed by rainwater infiltration through the soil which favours Cl− dilution. Right under the hedge and downslope, the rapid ascent of the groundwater near the ground surface prevents rainwater input and Cl− dilution. Under the hedgerow the highest concentrations of Cl− coincide with the absence of NO3− in the shallow groundwater layer and with high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon. The absence of NO3− during the dormant season seems to be due to denitrification in the hedgerow rooting zone when it is rapidly saturated by groundwater.

Heinen; Olga A. Clevering,"In this paper the suitability of a buffer strip to reduce nitrate concentrations in the upper groundwater was tested for a sandy arable soil in The Netherlands during two consecutive leaching seasons. The bufferstrip was a 3.5 m wide unfertilised grass strip adjacent to a ditch on an arable field. In total 24 groundwater wells were installed in 4 transects perpendicular to the ditch to determine Cl, NO3 and δ15N concentrations. Piezometers were installed to assess the groundwater flow, which was in the direction of the ditch with small downward leakage across a peat layer at about 3 m depth. Nitrogen was dominantly present as nitrate (NO3). The NO3-N concentrations under the bufferstrip were significantly lower than under the adjacent arable field. The lower concentrations were due to dilution, uptake by grass and denitrification. Nitrate was actively removed in the bufferstrip, since the Cl/NO3 ratios were higher in the bufferstrip than in the remainder of the field. Furthermore, δ15N data indicated that denitrification occurred in the groundwater and increased with decreasing distance to the ditch. NO3-N loads to the ditch were estimated at 8.5 kg ha−1yr−1, which is relatively low for this area. We can, however, not determine whether these relatively low NO3-N loads were causally related to the reduced NO3-N concentrations in the bufferstrip. Nevertheless, the results of the present study are promising and justify additional research on the efficiency of bufferstrips to reduce NO3 concentrations in shallow groundwater, and subsequently reduce NO3 loading of surface water, under Dutch conditions.",79,1,81,91,Groundwater flow; Leaching (agriculture); Nitrate; Ditch; Hydrology; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Denitrification; Groundwater; Surface water,,,,,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Alibrary.wur.nl%3Awurpubs%2F362116 https://edepot.wur.nl/32321 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10705-007-9098-2.pdf https://paperity.org/p/12768530/reduced-nitrate-concentrations-in-shallow-ground-water-under-a-non-fertilised-grass https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10705-007-9098-2 http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/362116 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/29265232.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-007-9098-2,,10.1007/s10705-007-9098-2,1969281990,,0,007-826-604-298-801; 008-467-759-539-985; 009-248-758-733-184; 013-075-461-601-502; 014-675-797-942-445; 015-514-563-181-208; 016-437-799-863-096; 019-521-193-829-310; 027-749-616-959-274; 029-173-783-395-588; 029-491-286-007-883; 040-935-957-450-37X; 048-148-537-416-261; 049-377-460-200-299; 051-618-303-397-127; 061-921-656-864-362; 062-573-990-568-532; 063-536-611-593-468; 072-750-761-923-411; 083-692-916-137-156; 093-184-946-875-581; 096-931-094-587-058; 100-845-850-323-114; 104-230-077-662-702; 107-694-941-105-824; 123-258-153-354-351; 139-342-966-894-93X; 141-101-347-131-583; 146-412-667-526-365; 150-539-908-471-485; 152-517-409-039-554; 162-106-103-392-351; 168-228-690-607-508; 184-635-815-001-277; 186-231-509-533-744; 191-930-139-534-03X; 198-995-629-308-125; 199-041-193-782-166,16

Sauer; Richard Pfeiffer; John C. Tyndall,"Abstract Vegetative environmental buffers (VEB) are a potentially low cost sustainable odor mitigation strategy, but there is little to no data supporting their effectiveness. Wind tunnel experiments and field monitoring were used to determine the effect VEB had on wind flow patterns within a swine facility. Particle and odorous compound concentrations were monitored before and after the VEB. Wind tunnel experiments indicated that building orientation had about the same impact on air flow patterns as the combined buildings and VEB. Field monitoring studies revealed that air flow patterns at a swine facility were dynamic showing intense instability during the heat of the day, but stable air in the evening hours indicating that air during the day was controlled by vertical movement into the atmosphere while in the evening air patterns show a collapse mostly horizontal movement. Total particle counts before and after the vegetative buffer were reduced by over 40% and odorous compound concentrations for volatile fatty acids, phenol and indole compounds were reduced by 40–60%. Plant material taken from trees in the vegetative buffer showed no significant loading gradients between materials facing the swine facility and those opposite the swine facility. There were significantly higher loadings of odorous VFAs, phenolic, and indole compounds on plant material for samples taken from 2.7 m compared to samples taken from either 0.6 or 1.3 m indicating that vertical transport was major transport mechanism for odor at the swine facility.",149,,154,163,Wind tunnel; Airflow; Windbreak; Atmosphere; Particulates; Volatile fatty acids; Odor; Field monitoring; Environmental science; Environmental engineering,,,,National Pork Board,https://works.bepress.com/john_tyndall/20/ http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1159&context=nrem_pubs https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880911004038 https://core.ac.uk/display/38936553 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/nrem_pubs/160/ http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880911004038 https://core.ac.uk/download/38936553.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2011.12.002,,10.1016/j.agee.2011.12.002,2056772642,,0,001-611-844-031-288; 002-250-312-619-764; 005-069-019-067-406; 006-668-583-622-168; 007-055-169-362-828; 009-058-721-239-425; 009-402-278-633-881; 010-558-070-718-823; 012-374-703-836-341; 014-506-962-877-185; 015-491-067-062-446; 017-448-432-786-59X; 033-038-521-916-577; 041-437-174-092-902; 043-318-708-739-485; 051-117-594-818-431; 053-817-067-269-688; 057-329-773-596-507; 058-043-919-271-83X; 064-278-758-496-045; 065-278-663-673-199; 067-206-832-464-882; 071-529-067-648-115; 071-706-914-603-140; 071-869-085-332-975; 073-059-603-476-169; 077-678-229-055-628; 082-266-811-127-068; 084-591-923-804-387; 086-454-977-440-314; 093-665-672-173-650; 096-447-464-190-505; 097-764-337-185-864; 101-484-022-180-424; 102-974-479-278-980; 104-261-177-271-591; 105-126-027-204-726; 106-615-947-208-512; 109-253-545-970-698; 116-138-551-219-112; 124-957-165-608-485; 128-225-049-436-489; 133-617-055-382-337; 149-538-237-483-759; 164-462-371-013-42X; 172-329-563-782-554; 174-717-796-899-531; 176-200-035-516-832; 179-472-096-176-972; 192-862-999-515-829; 197-447-079-046-090; 197-587-372-119-935,27

Significantly more individuals were found in the centres (30-m position) than at the edges (3-m position). Conversely, species richness was significantly higher at the field edges than in the centres. 3 Of the ten most abundant species, Poecilus cupreus, Agonum muelleri and Pterostichus melanarius were significantly more abundant in the field centres than at the edges. Harpalus rufipes was significantly more abundant in the fields adjoining sown wildflower areas than in the fields adjoining grassy margins. 4 In conclusion, the response of carabid beetles to within-field position and adjoining habitats was species specific.

Predatory beetles are amongst the most numerous and diverse arthropods present in arable fields. The primary ecosystem services provided by predatory beetles are in biological control and food chain maintenance as they are a key resource for many higher organisms. However, to be effective biological control agents, able to respond quickly to wherever a pest infestation occurs, then they must be sufficiently abundant and widely distributed. Conservation biocontrol utilising predatory beetles has focussed on the impact of species that overwinter in adjacent field boundaries, although those overwintering within fields are often more abundant. If the abundance and distribution of predatory beetles is to be maximised then further knowledge of their spatial dynamics is required to ensure habitats are arranged appropriately. The spatio-temporal dynamics of boundary and field overwintering species was measured across 64 ha encompassing six fields and for three consecutive years using a grid of 973 pitfall traps. Boundary species were more numerous in spring (May and June) whereas more field species were captured in July. The species composition was comprised of relatively few taxa. Boundary species occurred in small patches that were distributed across the fields in spring, but were only found close to the margins in July. Patches persisted in some locations over two years. Field species occurred in larger patches, spread across particular fields and these were stable within years and to some extent between years. Game-cover strips were attractive to boundary species in the spring and summer and did not effect predator distribution in the adjacent crop.",54,1,19,33,Food chain; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Overwintering; Animal ecology; Ecosystem services; Species diversity; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093052308 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10526-008-9152-2 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20093052308.html https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10526-008-9152-2.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-008-9152-2,,10.1007/s10526-008-9152-2,2051152782,,0,001-805-510-702-358; 001-852-653-099-092; 002-840-565-989-288; 003-815-496-301-575; 006-392-660-511-361; 009-120-913-363-96X; 010-945-646-716-071; 012-604-481-033-367; 012-678-572-116-901; 014-396-882-188-748; 014-809-297-009-430; 015-159-829-255-283; 015-678-133-658-660; 015-822-368-499-370; 020-277-480-603-940; 020-284-748-634-576; 021-149-313-326-245; 021-269-960-589-638; 021-456-573-673-200; 022-070-333-305-083; 026-969-752-606-914; 027-763-966-219-752; 030-697-919-654-984; 031-114-644-626-51X; 032-197-766-209-231; 032-982-143-966-424; 033-144-145-401-770; 034-739-142-297-866; 034-985-325-044-398; 036-017-685-871-375; 039-839-177-684-866; 044-050-646-677-718; 051-889-049-410-932; 055-083-398-263-398; 056-101-024-270-22X; 056-892-041-411-85X; 057-612-922-967-628; 058-047-121-637-992; 058-098-786-154-557; 058-105-561-757-413; 058-192-427-115-768; 058-743-931-737-265; 062-036-445-726-722; 063-289-521-238-627; 064-338-086-975-394; 064-893-774-544-494; 069-379-822-515-162; 070-418-249-019-442; 072-817-046-222-302; 073-332-568-126-247; 076-310-036-021-331; 077-349-437-551-514; 082-091-227-062-603; 086-612-546-665-467; 087-186-786-234-321; 091-265-753-392-171; 091-355-794-203-313; 093-612-417-630-86X; 100-101-071-041-044; 105-822-130-588-624; 106-530-677-319-614; 109-407-548-674-770; 109-691-661-850-685; 111-528-391-156-029; 114-646-769-502-277; 119-770-186-900-96X; 121-451-598-539-06X; 131-664-900-573-480; 134-921-760-522-115; 136-144-359-225-48X; 139-370-690-432-15X; 142-547-556-180-595; 149-431-649-896-445; 155-441-042-474-752; 156-514-752-674-995; 157-847-583-216-492; 162-011-496-556-297; 163-430-104-815-820; 175-135-717-976-663; 183-044-272-459-669; 189-783-186-730-19X,53

Woody species appear to be less efficient in capturing nutrients from overland flow, at least outside the growing season. Tree seedlings prevent effective mowing and removal of hay, which may lead to an accumulation of dead hay on the zone. Therefore woody species should mainly be used in places where yearly mowing and removal of hay is not feasible.",,,,,Hay; Growing season; Nutrient; Horticulture; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Phosphorus; Agronomy,,,,,http://orgprints.org/16057/,http://orgprints.org/16057/,,,134228818,,0,,0

One aim was to test methods for increasing the amount of non-cultivated areas with high plant species diversity and at the same time suppressing the occurrence of weeds. The treatments consisted of re-establishing or broadening boundary strips, sowing a mixture of ley grasses and clover, of wild meadow species, or planting bushes. All treatments were managed by yearly mowing and taking away of the plant material. The vegetation was examined on two occasions during a 10-year period. At the second occasion, a set of untreated field boundaries (reference boundaries) in the vicinity of each experiment was examined for comparison. Sowing meadow species changed the species composition substantially compared to untreated boundaries. Out of 32 sown species, 22 remained after 10 years. These species are normally found in well-managed meadows or pastures. Species that did not establish or disappeared tended to be either adapted to moist or to dry conditions. Sowing meadow species kept the abundance of weeds on a lower level than sowing clover and grasses or free regeneration at one site and kept weed abundance lower or at least not higher than in reference boundaries.",101,1,21,29,Agriculture; Sowing; Vegetation; Ecology; Grassland; Weed; Species diversity; Agronomy; Abundance (ecology); Biology; Competition (biology),,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880903002755,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-8809(03)00275-5,,10.1016/s0167-8809(03)00275-5,2022604278,,0,000-669-594-539-024; 015-522-490-223-197; 028-572-626-271-09X; 034-200-514-640-583; 048-218-379-340-636; 059-361-082-177-816; 060-054-765-653-880; 060-086-333-706-623; 060-212-024-680-436; 069-379-822-515-162; 082-797-391-654-568; 091-415-969-356-605; 115-537-551-650-895; 121-691-035-270-645; 136-816-007-966-101; 151-368-087-827-60X; 155-735-744-555-796; 192-175-476-041-367,36

Hunt; T. A. Matheny; Kenneth C. Stone,"Riparian zones are recognized as landscape features that buffer streams from pollutants, particularly nitrogen. The objectives of this experiment were to (i) assess denitrification activity within a riparian zone and (ii) determine the influence of physical, chemical, and landscape features on denitrification. This experiment was conducted from 1994 to 1997 in North Carolina on a riparian zone contiguous to a spray field that was heavily loaded with swine lagoon wastewater. Denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) was measured on soils collected from (i) the soil surface, (ii) midway between the soil surface and water table, and (iii) above the water table. The DEA ranged from 3 to 1660 microg N(2)O-N kg(-1) soil h(-1). The DEA was highest next to the stream and lowest next to the spray field. Nitrate was found to be the limiting factor for denitrification. The DEA generally decreased with soil depth; means for the surface, middle, and bottom depths were 147, 83, and 67 microg N(2)O-N kg(-1) soil h(-1), respectively. These DEA values are higher than those reported for riparian zones adjoining cropland of the southeastern United States, but are lower than those reported for a constructed wetland used for treatment of swine wastewater. Regression analysis indicated that soil total nitrogen was the highest single factor correlated to DEA (r(2) = 0.65). The inclusion of water table depth, soil depth, and distance from the spray field improved the R(2) to 0.86. This riparian zone possessed sufficient soil area with high denitrifying conditions to be a significant factor in the removal of excess nitrogen in the ground water.",33,6,2367,2374,Riparian zone; Soil water; Denitrifying bacteria; Constructed wetland; Hydrology; Environmental science; Water table; Denitrification; Groundwater; Surface water; Environmental engineering,,"Animals; Ecosystem; Filtration; Manure; Nitrogen/analysis; Rivers; Soil; Swine; Trees; Waste Disposal, Fluid/methods; Water Pollutants/analysis; Water Pollution/prevention & control",Manure; Soil; Water Pollutants; Nitrogen,,https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/60820000/Manuscripts/2004/Man689.pdf https://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/60820000/Manuscripts/2004/Man689.pdf https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/33/6/2367 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2004.2367 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15537960,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2004.2367,15537960,10.2134/jeq2004.2367,2073530336,,0,012-899-875-361-698; 015-325-416-202-141; 016-437-799-863-096; 017-885-841-853-429; 021-187-528-186-865; 026-658-145-527-116; 030-587-602-032-688; 038-088-874-218-042; 048-513-319-982-524; 050-232-707-053-533; 053-093-567-362-36X; 054-510-754-647-273; 075-429-883-991-330; 075-731-436-057-973; 081-146-598-099-607; 083-258-693-486-102; 087-138-533-405-771; 104-993-597-055-071; 121-468-243-703-60X; 123-607-505-428-901; 137-890-167-917-845; 141-101-347-131-583; 149-173-692-977-372; 150-539-908-471-485; 168-149-351-696-563; 177-900-727-296-993,30

Park; Jeroen Minderman; Dave Goulson,"Wild bees provide a free and potentially diverse ecosystem service to farmers growing pollination-dependent crops. While many crops benefit from insect pollination, soft fruit crops, including strawberries are highly dependent on this ecosystem service to produce viable fruit. However, as a result of intensive farming practices and declining pollinator populations, farmers are increasingly turning to commercially reared bees to ensure that crops are adequately pollinated throughout the season. Wildflower strips are a commonly used measure aimed at the conservation of wild pollinators. It has been suggested that commercial crops may also benefit from the presence of noncrop flowers; however, the efficacy and economic benefits of sowing flower strips for crops remain relatively unstudied. In a study system that utilizes both wild and commercial pollinators, we test whether wildflower strips increase the number of visits to adjacent commercial strawberry crops by pollinating insects. We quantified this by experimentally sowing wildflower strips approximately 20 meters away from the crop and recording the number of pollinator visits to crops with, and without, flower strips. Between June and August 2013, we walked 292 crop transects at six farms in Scotland, recording a total of 2826 pollinators. On average, the frequency of pollinator visits was 25% higher for crops with adjacent flower strips compared to those without, with a combination of wild and commercial bumblebees (Bombus spp.) accounting for 67% of all pollinators observed. This effect was independent of other confounding effects, such as the number of flowers on the crop, date, and temperature. Synthesis and applications. This study provides evidence that soft fruit farmers can increase the number of pollinators that visit their crops by sowing inexpensive flower seed mixes nearby. By investing in this management option, farmers have the potential to increase and sustain pollinator populations over time.",5,16,3523,3530,Pollinator; Agriculture; Crop; Pollination; Sowing; Ecology; Wildflower; Intensive farming; Ecosystem services; Agronomy; Biology,Agriculture; Bombus; commercial pollinators; ecosystem service; management; sustainability; wild bees,,,Natural Environment Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council,https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/10023/7183/1/Feltham_et_al_2015_Ecology_and_Evolution.pdf http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/54227/ https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/7183 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26380683 https://www.scilit.net/article/5b06f29745b8353426ee7ce9278a8479 https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/22130/1/Feltham_et_al-2015-Ecology_and_Evolution.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/147236908 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ece3.1444 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4569045 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153351616 http://dspace.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/22130 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.1444,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.1444,26380683,10.1002/ece3.1444,1931753730,PMC4569045,0,002-133-948-308-90X; 002-247-521-796-364; 002-901-091-066-33X; 003-460-280-575-85X; 003-832-217-521-204; 004-000-691-683-651; 007-200-824-851-635; 009-361-087-991-944; 009-753-603-941-509; 013-197-273-238-561; 013-953-094-252-318; 016-802-784-506-937; 018-442-796-237-224; 025-292-651-091-431; 026-061-345-636-737; 027-050-207-007-409; 031-216-949-664-784; 032-075-244-114-803; 032-195-371-347-85X; 034-333-107-858-752; 034-814-822-756-779; 034-971-739-771-379; 034-980-495-883-757; 035-775-229-294-961; 037-649-247-809-59X; 041-009-101-656-681; 049-567-584-028-555; 050-789-646-565-700; 051-974-835-303-946; 053-134-204-213-603; 054-715-078-148-813; 056-019-593-378-596; 072-238-981-858-823; 080-552-327-769-530; 083-810-224-480-214; 085-873-692-684-50X; 088-610-508-506-59X; 089-820-647-773-411; 094-542-264-880-862; 111-875-984-295-231; 116-020-569-491-620; 119-463-734-275-473; 131-918-615-284-062; 145-554-749-752-451; 153-513-858-008-911; 155-691-175-864-748; 169-938-531-431-077,74

Parkyn; R. J. Davies-Colley; N. Jane Halliday; Kerry J. Costley; Glenys F. Croker,"Abstract River and stream rehabilitation projects are increasing in number, but the success or failure of these projects has rarely been evaluated, and the extent to which buffers can restore riparian and stream function and species composition is not well understood. In New Zealand the widespread conversion of forest to agricultural land has caused degradation of streams and riparian ecosystems. We assessed nine riparian buffer zone schemes in North Island, New Zealand that had been fenced and planted (age range from 2 to 24 years) and compared them with unbuffered control reaches upstream or nearby. Macroinvertebrate community composition was our prime indicator of water and habitat quality and ecological functioning, but we also assessed a range of physical and water quality variables within the stream and in the riparian zone. Generally, streams within buffer zones showed rapid improvements in visual water clarity and channel stability, but nutrient and fecal contamination responses were variable. Significant changes in macroinvertebrate communities toward “clean water” or native forest communities did not occur at most of the study sites. Improvement in invertebrate communities appeared to be most strongly linked to decreases in water temperature, suggesting that restoration of in-stream communities would only be achieved after canopy closure, with long buffer lengths, and protection of headwater tributaries. Expectations of riparian restoration efforts should be tempered by (1) time scales and (2) spatial arrangement of planted reaches, either within a catchment or with consideration of their proximity to source areas of recolonists.",11,4,436,447,Riparian zone; Riparian forest; Tributary; Habitat; Ecology; Riparian buffer; Buffer zone; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science; Channel (geography),,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1526-100X.2003.rec0260.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1526-100x.2003.rec0260.x,,10.1046/j.1526-100x.2003.rec0260.x,1998163051,,0,005-067-865-619-004; 010-083-294-693-008; 012-216-983-643-697; 012-899-875-361-698; 014-051-521-444-503; 015-392-083-515-819; 017-406-073-751-479; 020-421-029-056-317; 024-562-486-961-974; 025-193-868-192-213; 028-128-711-639-046; 031-876-327-508-182; 032-514-448-851-196; 034-209-921-490-245; 040-198-568-662-726; 041-657-106-846-13X; 049-063-096-858-446; 050-358-608-073-575; 052-261-353-347-416; 053-093-567-362-36X; 054-370-205-436-017; 057-191-112-701-980; 057-727-962-585-077; 060-161-134-849-717; 061-196-720-313-479; 061-886-185-960-41X; 066-343-136-026-197; 068-898-246-905-91X; 076-516-213-885-952; 086-271-674-363-76X; 086-674-928-003-809; 087-428-281-813-837; 089-146-819-032-993; 092-511-254-871-204; 095-483-804-128-84X; 116-392-527-740-93X; 121-178-085-490-606; 122-420-168-066-607; 125-701-593-400-995; 125-859-662-791-556; 129-936-583-203-260; 141-546-505-257-723; 149-977-108-300-826; 169-607-559-923-667; 171-527-705-287-307; 185-225-958-247-607,174

Neary; Philip J. Smethurst; Brenda R. Baillie; Kevin C. Petrone; WE Cotching; Craig Baillie,"Purpose; In Australia, farmers and natural resource managers are striving to enhance environmental outcomes at farm and catchment scales by planting streamside management zones (SMZs) on farms with trees and other perennial vegetation. Lack of sound information on and funding for establishing and managing trees in SMZs is hindering wide-scale adoption of this practice. Australian Codes of Forest Practice discourage or prevent harvesting of trees in SMZs of perennial streams. One concern is the potential effect of tree harvesting in SMZs on delivery of sediment to adjacent streams. The aims of this paper were to summarize the literature relevant to this concern and, in one case study in an agricultural context, to determine the effects on turbidity of harvesting a SMZ plantation.",10,4,652,670,Riparian zone; Agriculture; Felling; Vegetation; Perennial stream; Context (language use); Natural resource; Environmental science; STREAMS; Agroforestry,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103223402 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11368-010-0234-2.pdf https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2010_neary_d001.pdf https://paperity.org/p/4955915/does-tree-harvesting-in-streamside-management-zones-adversely-affect-stream-turbidity https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103223402.html https://core.ac.uk/display/81715238 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11368-010-0234-2 http://ecite.utas.edu.au/63593 https://srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/35212 https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/35212,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-010-0234-2,,10.1007/s11368-010-0234-2,1967809361,,0,001-699-479-136-901; 002-862-233-040-612; 009-787-401-945-339; 012-830-214-628-345; 013-813-785-216-370; 013-907-235-810-284; 014-581-695-995-848; 015-479-063-624-470; 017-406-073-751-479; 017-853-254-273-968; 018-103-292-961-116; 019-554-697-989-028; 023-763-308-962-047; 029-294-447-653-235; 030-309-671-032-737; 031-204-198-958-192; 033-740-830-599-472; 033-937-795-558-171; 037-335-508-675-330; 037-655-906-160-749; 039-411-986-930-265; 040-168-084-243-413; 040-806-887-128-56X; 043-671-986-514-46X; 044-053-368-372-714; 044-401-317-828-273; 044-623-657-378-698; 045-514-363-644-720; 047-315-074-139-26X; 056-448-774-024-709; 056-860-626-311-276; 059-596-777-486-785; 060-624-992-124-120; 060-669-015-145-853; 064-318-710-836-745; 066-727-776-146-130; 080-812-176-152-098; 083-315-055-561-014; 095-454-715-614-050; 101-423-370-113-771; 106-284-569-265-355; 106-677-487-924-932; 111-435-647-398-863; 113-995-876-995-002; 115-853-469-980-427; 120-522-014-726-902; 126-051-201-417-566; 130-109-547-751-32X; 131-532-176-733-767; 134-515-444-500-017; 137-629-682-229-802; 142-050-496-110-793; 143-426-449-305-124; 143-857-918-860-126; 146-070-288-231-287; 147-171-523-241-426; 147-741-755-073-240; 152-271-946-958-209; 165-689-655-317-292; 165-953-604-215-165; 172-114-718-462-46X; 180-227-895-723-203; 194-582-265-554-446; 198-721-303-385-835,22

Ney; Troy A. Meyers; Africa A. Espina; Jerald L. Schnoor,"A model is developed to predict annual and total above-ground carbon storage within a hybrid poplar stream buffer. The regression model predicts tree wet weight based upon circumference at breast-height (137 cm) with an r-square value of 0.9922. Carbon storage in above-ground biomass is estimated to be 3.57 to 3.71 metric tons per hectare, with a measured annual increment of 0.92 to 1.37 metric ton per hectare per year. The variability of carbon storage within this biological system, including soil organic matter, is explored, and the number of samples required to achieve a desired level of statistical certainty are predicted. As has been investigated previously for other biological systems (Garten and Wullschleger, 1999), the study shows that a prohibitively large number of samples must be taken in order to achieve high degrees of certainty about mean carbon storage values. The study also shows, however, that mean values with somewhat greater uncertainties can easily be achieved with much smaller sample sizes. Thus carbon sequestration verification might be accomplished cost-effectively if the degree of certainty required is not unrealistically high for highly variable natural systems.",102,1,375,388,Soil science; Soil organic matter; Hectare; Carbon sequestration; Biomass; Environmental science; Greenhouse gas; Carbon; Carbon cycle; Tonne; Environmental engineering,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/61028468 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15869197 http://ir.uiowa.edu/cee_pubs/225/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10661-005-6393-8,https://core.ac.uk/display/61028468,,,1989375562,,0,022-582-828-625-600; 024-555-323-629-816; 052-982-715-371-625; 054-769-809-715-919; 063-697-141-689-04X; 078-948-075-960-847; 110-189-439-861-756; 118-244-426-247-474; 169-607-559-923-667,2

Best,"Abstract The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) under its Continuous Enrollment Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has actively promoted establishment of conservation buffers. Although these programs are intended to benefit wildlife in addition to protecting soil and water resources, benefits to grassland birds may be compromised by narrow widths, presence of woody vegetation, and high predation pressure. During 2001 and 2002, we surveyed breeding grassland birds and searched for nests in 33 CRP filter strips that varied in planting mixture (cool-season vs. warm-season grasses) and adjacent edge type (non-wooded vs. wooded). The most abundant species in filter strips were red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), dickcissel (Spiza americana), song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), and common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas). Relative abundances of birds and nests were similar between cool-season and warm-season planting mixtures.

The study sites were a field margin totally dominated by couch grass, Elytrigia repens (L.) Nevski, a serious weed, and a field margin with a naturally diverse flora. The couch-grass dominated margin was in part ploughed and sown with leguminous plants, or left as fallow for natural succession of vegetation. The field margin with a naturally diverse flora harboured the highest abundance and diversity of all studied arthropod groups. However, couch grass, especially the dense vegetation and deep sod layer, appeared to be an important refuge for many groups, particularly predatory insects. Both the created leguminous and the weed-dominated natural successions were frequently visited by pollen- and nectar-feeding insects, while arthropods hibernating in the soil in late autumn were scarce.

C. Reberg-Horton; J. P. Mueller; S. J. Mellage; Nancy G. Creamer; Cavell Brownie; M. Bell; Michael G. Burton,"Natural vegetation occurring on farms in field margins, fallow fields, ditch systems and neighboring forests, provides increased biodiversity, structural diversity, habitat for wildlife and beneficial insects, and can act as a protective buffer against agrochemical drift. Nevertheless, farmers frequently view these areas as non-productive and as potential sources of weeds, insect pests and diseases. Weed species richness and abundance were examined in crop fields in 2002–2003 at the Center for Environmental Farming Systems near Goldsboro, NC to determine if crop field weed infestation was associated with field margin management (managed versus unmanaged). Weed species abundance and richness were measured over two growing seasons on four occasions in crop fields along permanent transects that extended from the field edge toward the center of the field. The presence/absence of data for all plant species in the field margin was also recorded. For both margin types, managed and unmanaged, more weeds were found near the field edge than in the center of the field. Weed species richness was slightly higher in cropland bordering managed margins than in cropland along unmanaged margins. Several significant interactions led to an examination of nine dominant weed species in each field margin type and their distribution in crop fields. When all sampling dates were pooled, only 42 (40%) of 105 species identified in the field margins were observed in the crop field. Managed margins had lower species richness than unmanaged field margins—less than half the mean number of species (15 versus 6 species, respectively). Contingency table analysis did not reveal any association between plant species occurring in the margin and those found in the crop field. Furthermore, margin type and weed presence in the field margin were not effective predictors of weed occurrence in the crop field as determined by logistic regression.",26,2,127,136,Relative species abundance; Biodiversity; Growing season; Habitat; Global biodiversity; Weed; Species richness; Agroforestry; Agronomy; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/renewable-agriculture-and-food-systems/article/influence-of-field-margin-type-on-weed-species-richness-and-abundance-in-conventional-crop-fields/262FF7211467195F6B134B48E1469804 https://bearworks.missouristate.edu/articles-coa/240/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1742170510000451,,10.1017/s1742170510000451,1990148149,,0,006-218-904-166-709; 007-243-303-723-240; 012-335-108-074-344; 025-285-299-216-809; 031-712-522-366-166; 056-789-845-462-569; 060-212-024-680-436; 065-071-886-701-523; 083-758-286-373-216; 088-934-637-295-013; 091-458-426-757-031; 095-219-675-979-046; 108-007-092-968-56X; 117-345-687-903-78X; 125-512-608-629-475; 162-892-009-096-821; 179-268-492-785-894,5

Udawatta; Stephen H. Anderson; Ashish Mudgal,"Buffers have been found to reduce non-point source pollution (NPSP) from watersheds. Hydrologic simulation models assist in predicting the effects of buffers on runoff and sediment losses from small watersheds. The objective of this study was to calibrate, validate and simulate runoff and sediment losses and compare buffer effects on NPSP losses relative to control watersheds (no buffer) for seven years. The experimental design consists of four watersheds under pasture management which were monitored from 2002 through 2008; two with agroforestry buffers (AgB 100 and AgB 300) and two control watersheds (CW 400 and CW 600). Pasture areas included red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) and lespedeza (Kummerowia stipulacea Maxim.) planted into fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) while the agroforestry buffer area included Eastern cottonwood trees (Populus deltoids Bortr. ex Marsh.) planted into fescue. The APEX model was calibrated from 2002 to 2005 and was validated from 2006 to 2008. The r2 and NSE values for the calibration and validation periods of the runoff varied from 0.52 to 0.78 and 0.50 to 0.74, respectively. The model did not predict sediment loss very well probably due to insufficient number of measured events and low measured sediment loss. The measured runoff was 57% higher for CW watersheds compared to AgB watersheds. The measured sediment loss was 95% higher for CW watersheds compared to AgB watersheds. After calibrating and validating the model, it was run for long-term scenario analyses for 10 years from 1999 to 2008. Simulated buffer width had a significant influence on runoff. Simulated runoff decreased by 24% when the buffer width was doubled compared to losses associated with the measured buffer width. Simulated runoff from the CW watersheds was 11% higher with double stocking density (relative to measured density) compared to AgB watersheds with double stocking density. With half stocking density (relative to measured density), the AgB watershed had 18% lower runoff compared to CW. Results from this study imply that establishment of agroforestry buffers on grazed pasture watersheds reduce runoff and sediment losses compared to control watersheds without buffers.",83,1,51,62,Simulation modeling; Watershed; Stocking; Pasture; Eastern Cottonwood; Sediment; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Pollution; Agroforestry,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-010-9350-7/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10457-010-9350-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-010-9350-7,,10.1007/s10457-010-9350-7,1969875840,,0,001-622-064-959-791; 004-771-960-697-150; 005-235-828-092-362; 006-190-003-301-107; 008-380-052-396-94X; 013-962-017-892-957; 019-622-915-734-27X; 021-981-714-885-895; 026-802-370-774-790; 028-802-252-344-012; 031-431-985-525-652; 034-468-599-710-065; 039-075-642-251-226; 054-070-224-919-941; 054-779-623-720-76X; 055-486-051-386-205; 055-488-793-301-441; 056-444-102-079-143; 062-528-990-554-138; 063-488-818-272-529; 064-864-423-263-276; 066-947-210-171-825; 074-364-009-770-32X; 081-088-522-178-170; 082-797-391-654-568; 088-017-310-971-747; 092-375-275-782-901; 092-843-881-158-062; 105-944-246-057-441; 137-129-103-379-099; 143-762-546-959-86X; 146-564-233-748-350; 153-472-582-944-670; 159-491-143-715-990; 161-900-120-826-037; 175-196-769-643-19X; 178-569-929-323-960; 180-269-022-208-11X,18

Permanent vegetation strips on cul- tivated slopes could be an effective soil conservation technique to reduce erosion. Previous studies showed that cultivated Mahonia aquifolium can be an effective plant for water erosion control. However, no detailed studies have been carried out to evaluate the efficiency of M. aquifolium as a permanent vegetation strip. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of M. aquifolium strips on soil erosion control under various bio-physical conditions with the use of the Revised Morgan-Morgan-Finney model (RMMF). The RMMF model was first calibrated by using measured quantities of surface runoff and validated against soil loss data from M. aquifolium plots. After calibration the model showed erosion to be transport limited process for all M. aquifolium plots and a detachment limited for the bare soil control plot. The model was then used to predict surface runoff and soil loss for various soil types, slope angles and cultivations with and without M. aquifolium strips. The study indicated that the presence of M. aquifolium strips substantially reduced the soil loss rate on all studied crop fields. For steeper slopes with M. aquifolium strips the model predicted a lower soil loss rate than for gentle slopes without strips.",122,,159,169,Soil conservation; Erosion; Soil classification; Vegetation; Soil stabilization; Mahonia aquifolium; Transport limited; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff,,,,,http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/301953 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0341816214001933 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0341816214001933 https://core.ac.uk/display/39794535 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Steven_De_Jong2/publication/264161019_Modelling_soil_erosion_reduction_by_Mahonia_aquifolium_on_hillslopes_in_Hungary_The_impact_of_soil_stabilization_by_roots/links/54897be40cf289302e32a27b.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2014.06.017,,10.1016/j.catena.2014.06.017,2067259934,,0,002-093-694-200-435; 002-399-289-995-985; 002-967-588-995-064; 004-255-817-831-088; 009-579-957-478-522; 010-837-591-226-017; 012-152-844-161-292; 013-640-580-059-161; 014-512-992-631-873; 014-587-187-537-530; 015-417-195-593-799; 015-423-301-659-458; 016-442-324-728-364; 016-939-598-893-491; 018-148-119-375-825; 018-450-252-501-023; 019-249-912-225-434; 020-270-264-950-700; 020-330-129-711-346; 022-756-889-241-165; 024-940-804-415-350; 027-106-252-180-614; 028-088-622-742-195; 029-409-261-468-418; 035-525-573-465-879; 036-454-863-195-177; 038-761-685-281-55X; 039-158-063-544-546; 039-843-811-708-610; 040-830-079-512-854; 042-299-549-819-519; 049-953-430-519-744; 051-534-545-116-297; 052-084-833-010-690; 053-668-626-056-528; 058-555-746-979-598; 060-998-500-698-926; 063-933-264-945-957; 073-350-933-007-342; 077-995-908-564-423; 086-812-760-777-597; 091-837-932-273-742; 093-157-000-935-703; 093-616-146-771-772; 097-401-631-797-922; 102-523-543-879-105; 106-996-115-166-622; 107-276-822-272-53X; 114-870-593-945-811; 117-095-370-385-460; 123-744-584-778-133; 141-080-718-351-72X; 142-317-792-078-177; 166-004-109-190-230; 175-843-619-559-572; 176-961-483-594-048; 187-517-325-725-004; 194-280-945-767-353,4

Shaw; Paul J. Johnson; David W. Macdonald; Ruth E. Feber,"Drainage ditches, either seasonally flooded or permanent, are commonly found on intensively managed lowland farmland in the UK. They are potentially important for wetland biodiversity but, despite their ubiquity, information on their biodiversity and management in the wider countryside is scarce. We surveyed 175 ditches for their physical and chemical characteristics, spatial connectivity, plant communities and aquatic invertebrates in an area of intensively managed farmland in Oxfordshire, UK and collected information on ditch management from farmer interviews. Water depth and shade had a small impact on the diversity of plant and invertebrate communities in ditches. Increased shade over the ditch channel resulted in reduced taxonomic richness of both channel vegetation and aquatic invertebrates and channel vegetation cover was lower at shaded sites. Invertebrate taxonomic richness was higher when water was deeper. Spatial connectivity had no detectable impact on the aquatic invertebrate or plant communities found in ditches. The number of families within the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT), which contain many pollution-sensitive species, declined with decreasing pH of ditch water. As time since dredging increased, the number of EPT families increased in permanent ditches but decreased in temporary ditches. Whether or not a ditch was in an agri-environment scheme had little impact on the reported management regime or biodiversity value of the ditch. Measures for increasing the amount of water in ditches, by increasing the water depth or promoting retention of water in ditches, could increase the biodiversity value of ditches in agricultural land. Some temporary ditches for specialised species should be retained. Reducing the amount of shade over narrow ditches by managing adjacent hedgerows is also likely to increase the species diversity of plant and invertebrate communities within the ditch. We recommend that to preserve or enhance the biodiversity value of ditches, and improve their ecosystem service delivery, management prescriptions for hedgerows adjacent to ditches should differ from those aimed at hedgerows only.",10,10,e0138306,,Biodiversity; Vegetation; Geography; Ditch; Environmental pollution; Plant community; Species richness; Agroforestry; Species diversity; Wetland,,"Agriculture/methods; Animals; Biodiversity; Environmental Pollution/adverse effects; Invertebrates/drug effects; Plants; United Kingdom; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical/adverse effects; Wetlands","Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26445146 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26445146/ https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0138306 https://paperity.org/p/73983660/enhancing-the-biodiversity-of-ditches-in-intensively-managed-uk-farmland https://core.ac.uk/display/150124009 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PLoSO..1038306S/abstract http://europepmc.org/article/MED/26445146,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0138306,26445146,10.1371/journal.pone.0138306,2141000027,PMC4596843,0,001-457-135-894-766; 001-667-505-805-181; 003-461-880-854-275; 005-769-046-282-205; 007-748-151-849-680; 008-073-690-711-246; 008-524-220-939-553; 013-143-342-453-561; 015-276-662-838-876; 015-825-410-503-104; 016-421-756-148-512; 017-581-076-486-349; 017-991-432-760-300; 018-797-363-505-484; 018-920-871-093-237; 019-234-857-538-507; 022-438-869-235-426; 023-150-755-367-408; 025-990-754-410-325; 030-523-500-067-676; 031-434-972-081-136; 032-494-612-708-485; 032-502-062-020-869; 032-509-462-591-048; 039-270-311-852-944; 039-314-331-841-400; 040-054-642-273-583; 040-532-664-803-091; 042-034-223-767-372; 042-746-580-549-408; 043-900-591-870-482; 046-922-146-668-557; 053-024-791-968-164; 053-509-798-892-145; 062-689-906-867-519; 064-636-600-002-276; 070-861-776-373-714; 073-247-449-875-839; 082-714-080-755-584; 083-000-721-653-361; 084-200-224-780-91X; 085-408-776-824-254; 098-086-187-871-16X; 100-211-964-096-496; 101-656-029-176-741; 106-009-107-218-603; 106-184-521-213-152; 109-802-423-459-241; 122-154-985-613-384; 124-193-767-897-678; 129-692-017-031-224; 130-042-670-727-110; 131-210-994-753-610; 139-002-674-261-62X; 149-219-444-648-167; 157-952-466-995-882; 159-938-497-832-818; 179-402-327-063-059; 179-517-966-221-279; 183-502-124-756-149,11

J. Ducros; Christopher Joyce,"Riparian buffer zones can improve water quality and enhance habitat, but a comprehensive yet rapid method that can assist the resource manager in assessing the effectiveness of buffers is not available. The aim of this paper is to describe and illustrate the use of a newly developed field-based evaluation tool for riparian buffer zones in agricultural catchments. The Buffer Zone Inventory and Evaluation Form (BZIEF) incorporates criteria-based scoring systems developed from literature review, subsequent peer-review, and then a pilot field study. Use of the BZIEF is demonstrated by comparing buffer zones in three catchments established for water quality and habitat improvement under the Water Fringe Option agrienvironment scheme in England in order to assess whether the buffers were likely to provide environmental enhancement. Results among the three catchments were generally similar; buffer zones scored highly for their abundant vegetation cover, lack of erosion, stream habitat quality, and sufficient width. Furthermore, previous grassland or arable land use did not substantially affect buffer zone ratings. However, the BZIEF indicated that inappropriate soil characteristics in one catchment were likely to constrain buffer zone effectiveness for improving water quality. In another catchment, poor riparian vegetation diversity and structure may yield ineffective habitat enhancement, according to the BZIEF. It was concluded that the BZIEF might be a useful tool for buffer zone comparison and monitoring, even though more work is needed to test and validate the method. For example, the BZIEF could be used to target appropriate locations for buffer zones and is flexible, so could be adapted for different policies, objectives and regions.",32,2,252,267,Riparian zone; Erosion; Habitat; Plant cover; Riparian buffer; Buffer zone; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science; Arable land,,Agriculture; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring/methods; Poaceae; Quality Control; Rivers; Trees; Water Movements; Water Pollution/prevention & control,,,https://research.brighton.ac.uk/en/publications/field-base-evaluation-tool-for-riparian-buffer-zones-in-agricultu https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-003-2913-x https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14753650/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/14753650 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14753650,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-003-2913-x,14753650,10.1007/s00267-003-2913-x,1988763464,,0,010-193-923-056-157; 013-837-754-758-309; 015-342-032-824-51X; 016-327-566-425-434; 024-178-088-841-823; 025-193-868-192-213; 031-308-300-948-57X; 035-093-656-083-327; 037-315-124-217-631; 038-052-133-910-360; 038-659-320-814-260; 042-293-727-219-763; 044-401-317-828-273; 044-686-280-596-043; 049-377-460-200-299; 053-093-567-362-36X; 060-161-134-849-717; 066-343-136-026-197; 066-360-222-781-695; 068-997-932-046-194; 072-045-503-834-551; 072-782-954-705-847; 079-006-018-469-602; 087-369-280-042-754; 088-526-158-902-16X; 090-091-668-943-545; 098-004-631-148-428; 104-230-077-662-702; 108-227-856-010-154; 111-435-647-398-863; 115-642-860-718-878; 116-065-618-368-696; 116-154-736-226-300; 141-101-347-131-583; 169-637-192-822-911; 172-304-497-701-670; 172-729-211-137-618,27

The Island has one of the highest percentages of land (about 48%) devoted to crop production and pasture in all of Canada. Therefore, identifying the landscape elements that can mitigate the effects of habitat fragmentation resulting from agricultural practices is essential to preserve the biodiversity of Prince Edward Island. We quantified species richness, abundance and diversity of small mammals in 13 hedgerows and 13 attached forest patches. Although all the species detected in forest patches were also found in hedgerows, significant differences in species diversity and abundance suggest that not all species benefit equally from hedgerows. The abundance of small mammals other than the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) increased in hedgerows longer than about 225–250 m, but was independent of hedgerow's length in hedgerows smaller than 225–250 m.

They are among the most threatened agricultural landscapes of western Europe. Intensification of agriculture with the conversion of permanent grassland into ploughed land and the use of new machinery leads to the enlargement of fields and the removal of hedgerows surrounding them. There is a growing concern among conservationists, rural managers and the public to maintain these greenways as a framework for landscape sustainability. In France, hedgerow removal may be planned within reallotment programmes that take into account all the land of a municipality. In this planning process, criteria for keeping or clearing woody elements are based on agronomic properties of soil, environmental quality of elements and of the network, and property boundaries. Aesthetic aspects are rarely assessed. As rural landscapes are shifting from an almost unique function of agricultural production toward a multifunction of nature conservation, environmental protection, amenity and production, the conservation of hedgerow networks becomes of greater importance. The goal is now the protection of these greenways to provide not only ecological but also recreational and cultural benefits. In a case study in Brittany, we tried to link these different aspects. Our work is based on interviews and a landscape ecological survey. We found contrasting opinions between farmers and non-farmers concerning the density of the network. Nevertheless, the two groups agree on the necessity to keep greenways as part of their cultural landscape. Most of the people were not aware of the ecological role of hedgerow networks, and perceive them only by their visual properties. We proposed various scenarios based on ecological and aesthetic principles, and defined general guidelines for the design of new landscapes during reallotment programmes. The integration of different points of view by landscape planners is the only way to link visual values to productive or ecological processes, and must be effective in the case of the management of greenways such as hedgerows.",33,1-3,327,340,Recreation; Cultural landscape; Agricultural productivity; Ecology; Geography; Hedgerow removal; Amenity; Sustainability; Environmental quality; Landscape ecology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016920469402026C,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0169-2046(94)02026-c,,10.1016/0169-2046(94)02026-c,1972278488,,0,009-064-884-569-067; 024-501-736-867-747; 024-639-748-064-02X; 029-105-025-347-654; 040-438-307-576-758; 044-307-523-708-239; 049-055-298-294-941; 057-216-974-134-105; 060-342-609-139-480; 073-991-527-323-833; 089-120-143-077-562; 090-241-745-097-057; 099-275-474-038-647; 110-250-911-763-923; 111-333-657-300-13X; 112-148-110-351-322; 115-818-187-214-915; 122-176-999-824-374; 126-903-252-358-903; 134-475-232-519-759; 150-494-637-604-381; 153-404-848-965-512; 153-542-156-060-937; 165-325-555-425-125; 187-050-769-304-212,100

Shaw; Joel Douglas,"Recent research at Mississippi State has shown that eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, and tall fescue grown as filter strips reduce herbicide losses in runoff from cotton. Field experiments were conducted in 1997 and 1998 to evaluate the response of these perennial grasses to postemergence drift and registered rates of glyphosate and paraquat in mid-April and clethodim, fluazifop-P, glyphosate, MSMA, pyrithiobac, quizalofop-P, and sethoxydim in early June. Results indicate that filter strip implementation will not simply involve establishment and maintenance. In most instances, reductions in harvested biomass were as high or higher than visual injury assessments in mid-June. This finding suggests an inability of these perennial grasses to recover from an accidental overspray or drift, within the year of the event. Management decisions must be made to protect the filter strips from contact with herbicides used in the production system to ensure filter strip integrity and survival.

Paudel; Ranjith P. Udawatta; Stephen H. Anderson,"Abstract Establishment of buffers and incorporation of trees and shrubs are believed to improve soil quality and thereby improve water quality from grazed pasture systems. Although enzyme activities and water stable aggregates have been identified as measurable soil quality parameters for early responses to changes in soil management, the literature lacks information on those parameters for grazing systems with agroforestry buffers. The objective of this study was to examine the activities of fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolase, dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase and β-glucosaminidase, the percentage of water stable aggregates (WSA) and soil organic carbon and nitrogen as soil quality parameters for grazed pasture and row-crop systems. The study consisted of four management treatments: grazed pasture (GP), agroforestry buffer (AgB), grass buffer (GB) and row-crop (RC). The WSA was determined by wet sieving method while the enzyme activities were colorimetrically quantified using a spectrophotometer in laboratory assays. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents were also determined. Two soil depths (0–10 and 10–20 cm) were analyzed for all treatments. The row-crop treatment showed significantly lower activities compared to all other treatments for β-glucosidase and β-glucosaminidase enzymes along with lower WSA. The dehydrogenase activities were significantly higher in GP treatment compared to RC treatment. The FDA hydrolase activities were not significantly different among treatments. Surface soil revealed higher enzyme activities and higher WSA than the sub-surface soil. The treatment by depth interaction was significant for β-glucosidase and β-glucosaminidase enzymes. The soil organic carbon and total nitrogen data strongly supported the results of enzyme activities and WSA. Implications can be made that perennial vegetation enhances organic matter accumulation in the soil, has minimum disturbance to the soil and will have positive impacts on the ecosystem.",48,2,125,132,Ecosystem; Perennial plant; Soil quality; Grazing; Water quality; Environmental science; Soil carbon; Organic matter; Agroforestry; Agronomy; Soil management,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139311000771,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2011.04.004,,10.1016/j.apsoil.2011.04.004,1998295918,,0,000-201-907-509-86X; 002-271-389-418-63X; 004-771-960-697-150; 005-215-659-380-778; 006-083-800-428-238; 008-380-052-396-94X; 013-547-662-323-089; 014-026-509-704-03X; 015-620-073-261-95X; 016-725-382-309-766; 017-494-030-235-928; 019-622-915-734-27X; 019-697-614-617-578; 027-429-199-805-844; 028-106-711-394-010; 028-146-838-004-688; 028-330-817-487-676; 031-017-179-874-053; 036-315-734-250-926; 036-625-376-116-797; 044-214-456-182-827; 044-623-657-378-698; 049-660-923-994-771; 049-972-522-559-229; 054-162-047-302-972; 054-245-802-372-063; 055-486-051-386-205; 056-908-848-757-783; 057-283-555-498-270; 057-798-446-166-229; 062-253-039-022-413; 064-872-788-307-008; 065-234-881-061-065; 066-597-669-362-855; 074-409-624-022-848; 074-623-587-956-103; 075-239-776-800-503; 077-842-859-435-846; 081-347-358-673-391; 083-172-644-867-956; 088-017-310-971-747; 089-267-416-283-668; 092-410-436-114-594; 092-804-670-514-23X; 092-941-160-711-170; 093-233-075-589-296; 096-499-726-729-908; 096-658-417-036-927; 097-162-808-147-613; 098-786-514-202-615; 100-352-856-504-930; 100-679-216-297-456; 114-634-177-859-258; 114-713-454-502-122; 121-177-129-261-350; 128-187-888-119-092; 129-995-958-647-803; 137-649-591-574-609; 138-121-533-037-654; 139-114-598-021-152; 147-428-454-235-823; 149-633-039-918-024; 150-026-070-813-336; 152-157-521-163-436; 159-237-134-366-844; 161-671-403-526-169; 173-208-888-012-406; 181-950-948-397-544; 185-116-269-568-509,54

Hill; Dave Goulson,"In recent years, an intense debate about the environmental risks posed by neonicotinoids, a group of widely used, neurotoxic insecticides, has been joined. When these systemic compounds are applied to seeds, low concentrations are subsequently found in the nectar and pollen of the crop, which are then collected and consumed by bees. Here we demonstrate that the current focus on exposure to pesticides via the crop overlooks an important factor: throughout spring and summer, mixtures of neonicotinoids are also found in the pollen and nectar of wildflowers growing in arable field margins, at concentrations that are sometimes even higher than those found in the crop. Indeed, the large majority (97%) of neonicotinoids brought back in pollen to honey bee hives in arable landscapes was from wildflowers, not crops. Both previous and ongoing field studies have been based on the premise that exposure to neonicotinoids would occur only during the blooming period of flowering crops and that it may be diluted by bees also foraging on untreated wildflowers. Here, we show that exposure is likely to be higher and more prolonged than currently recognized because of widespread contamination of wild plants growing near treated crops.",49,21,12731,12740,Crop; Nectar; Pesticide; Neonicotinoid; Honey bee; Pollen; Plant Nectar; Environmental exposure; Agronomy; Biology,,"Anabasine/toxicity; Animals; Bees/metabolism; Brassica rapa/chemistry; Crops, Agricultural/chemistry; Environmental Exposure/analysis; Flowers/chemistry; Hordeum/chemistry; Insecticides/analysis; Plant Nectar/chemistry; Pollen/chemistry; Seeds/chemistry; Soil/chemistry; Triticum/chemistry",Insecticides; Plant Nectar; Soil; Anabasine,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/K014498/1) United Kingdom,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015EnST...4912731B/abstract https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26439915 http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.5b03459 https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.5b03459 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26439915 http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/57496/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26439915/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5b03459,26439915,10.1021/acs.est.5b03459,1948629506,,0,000-703-795-047-209; 002-363-145-800-97X; 003-709-929-067-376; 004-331-144-071-054; 006-045-872-975-671; 006-873-793-603-769; 008-370-950-529-303; 009-155-014-918-79X; 011-485-642-832-317; 011-594-952-070-795; 012-395-928-592-846; 016-037-383-642-107; 017-243-000-537-232; 018-293-771-552-395; 018-728-558-339-819; 024-204-497-979-352; 025-872-520-407-089; 028-403-131-717-566; 028-755-857-787-220; 031-862-039-493-29X; 033-459-762-518-620; 035-053-831-571-832; 037-142-583-684-543; 040-974-261-953-640; 043-262-767-141-352; 046-965-254-832-764; 051-623-164-446-502; 055-592-500-673-007; 056-892-630-404-500; 062-232-690-176-857; 063-903-729-213-426; 076-961-298-168-965; 079-543-425-039-89X; 080-264-084-827-372; 083-515-091-865-45X; 090-723-396-427-514; 090-981-119-231-267; 091-872-139-039-313; 095-147-409-690-266; 109-059-019-425-105; 114-793-580-658-606; 128-980-820-958-694; 129-921-120-667-526; 143-336-650-577-384; 147-644-604-994-187; 164-543-304-152-512,223

J. Williard; Sara G. Baer; Jon E. Schoonover; James J. Zaczek,"Abstract Forest and grass riparian buffers are a common conservation practice to control nonpoint source pollution. In the lower midwestern United States, there is significant interest in incorporating a once common native riparian species, giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea) in riparian restoration designs. Thus, assessing the water quality benefits of giant cane buffers is warranted. Ground water nitrate and ammonium concentrations were measured at the field edge (0 m), and 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, 9.0, and 12.0 m from the field edge through giant cane and forest riparian buffers adjacent to agricultural fields along three streams in southern Illinois. Ground water nitrate and ammonium were not different between the giant cane and forest riparian buffers, nor were there significant reductions in these nutrients through the riparian zones when all three sites were considered. However, site-specific regressions of nutrient concentration vs. distance showed significant reductions (>80%) in nitrate through two forest a...",74,3,259,270,Riparian zone; Riparian forest; Nonpoint source pollution; Eutrophication; Nitrate; Arundinaria gigantea; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science; Agroforestry; Restoration ecology,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/27742911.pdf https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093315805 https://bioone.org/journals/castanea/volume-74/issue-3/08-037R2.1/Ground-Water-Nitrogen-Dynamics-in-Giant-Cane-and-Forest-Riparian/10.2179/08-037R2.1.short https://bioone.org/journals/castanea/volume-74/issue-3/08-037R2.1/Ground-Water-Nitrogen-Dynamics-in-Giant-Cane-and-Forest-Riparian/10.2179/08-037R2.1.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2179/08-037r2.1,,10.2179/08-037r2.1,1925598987,,0,000-142-952-017-146; 003-451-422-132-663; 005-362-279-630-448; 005-448-995-003-661; 007-751-667-195-881; 008-467-759-539-985; 012-529-474-262-279; 021-187-528-186-865; 023-617-712-421-298; 029-294-447-653-235; 030-265-661-058-499; 035-949-078-774-024; 038-659-320-814-260; 039-010-174-687-899; 039-360-124-379-134; 040-935-957-450-37X; 044-401-317-828-273; 044-948-727-495-773; 044-982-906-041-039; 046-568-769-714-434; 048-148-537-416-261; 053-093-567-362-36X; 072-750-761-923-411; 077-354-829-416-449; 079-789-931-625-023; 080-589-148-600-106; 086-998-165-612-358; 087-138-533-405-771; 089-340-644-881-887; 098-004-631-148-428; 101-774-056-400-814; 103-989-366-241-549; 108-531-822-357-682; 113-057-949-435-76X; 115-864-182-852-341; 116-886-192-455-802; 131-482-047-635-703; 132-186-585-542-192; 141-101-347-131-583; 142-124-709-800-413; 150-539-908-471-485; 162-785-491-509-909; 164-350-768-837-199; 164-890-850-952-468; 169-607-559-923-667,10

To safeguard this conservation function, insight in the basic organizing principles of hedgerow plant communities is needed. The vegetation composition of 511 individual hedgerows situated within an ancient hedgerow network landscape in Flanders, Belgium was recorded, in combination with a wide range of explanatory variables, including a selection of spatial variables. Non-parametric statistics in combination with multivariate data analysis techniques were used to study the effect of individual explanatory variables. Next, variables were grouped in five distinct subsets and the relative importance of these variable groups was assessed by two related variation partitioning techniques, partial regression and partial canonical correspondence analysis, taking into account explicitly the existence of intercorrelations between variables of different factor groups. Most explanatory variables affected significantly hedgerow species richness and composition. Multivariate analysis showed that, besides adjacent land use, hedgerow management, soil conditions, hedgerow type and origin, the role of other factors such as hedge dimensions, intactness, etc., could certainly not be neglected. Furthermore, both methods revealed the same overall ranking of the five distinct factor groups. Besides a predominant impact of abiotic environmental conditions, it was found that management variables and structural aspects have a relatively larger influence on the distribution of plant species in hedgerows than their historical background or spatial configuration.",26,1,23,37,Canonical correspondence analysis; Biodiversity; Correspondence analysis; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Multivariate analysis; Plant community; Species richness; Canonical analysis,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004AcO....26...23D/abstract http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1146609X04000256 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1146609X04000256 https://core.ac.uk/display/34349849 https://www.biw.kuleuven.be/lbh/lbnl/ecology/pdf-files/pdf-art/bartd/actaoecologica2004.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2004.03.002,,10.1016/j.actao.2004.03.002,2121461770,,0,002-890-902-512-882; 006-926-721-254-631; 007-243-303-723-240; 007-361-282-044-640; 009-104-527-591-059; 010-250-877-529-926; 015-842-651-381-018; 020-713-595-267-906; 024-608-779-166-000; 028-917-029-117-685; 029-264-530-643-997; 029-386-831-957-40X; 031-712-522-366-166; 032-961-767-789-531; 041-161-807-605-997; 047-130-476-878-70X; 051-197-969-663-775; 052-363-993-930-092; 053-643-073-503-138; 057-001-477-328-971; 058-767-657-165-968; 060-093-061-735-556; 063-003-550-683-547; 064-975-099-130-640; 068-143-605-669-192; 071-601-864-758-089; 073-798-803-161-275; 074-793-529-288-006; 080-357-443-253-546; 083-714-994-906-170; 084-101-049-675-878; 086-838-473-034-93X; 091-329-166-565-795; 091-707-812-404-482; 092-500-679-636-986; 095-877-317-702-391; 108-370-770-776-601; 117-605-074-857-133; 124-946-190-161-386; 128-033-881-987-944; 130-698-554-759-854; 134-077-810-366-536; 138-864-654-742-242; 150-494-637-604-381; 154-750-119-428-838; 156-624-196-949-616; 165-991-284-285-988; 176-506-367-701-104; 187-050-769-304-212; 192-921-888-301-833,100

M. Kelly; J. L. Kovar; R. Sokolowsky; T. B. Moorman,"Vegetative buffers have been shown to reduce nutrient loss associated with the transport of detached soil particles and may through plant uptake offer a means to capture dissolved nutrients moving to surface waters through the soil solution. The objective of this 4-year study was to evaluate changes in the biomass and P content of the roots and shoots of plants growing in a multi-species versus a single species riparian buffer as an index of P capture potential. Periodic harvests of above ground vegetation were combined with root cores to estimate the total standing biomass and the pool of P in plant tissue in three vegetative cover types dominated by either switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), an alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-smooth bromegrass (Bromis inermis Leyss) mix, or a fast growing superior cottonwood (Populus deltoids Bartr., clone 42-7). An existing stand of smooth brome served as the single species control. Standing biomass increased in all three cover types during the 4 years of study, with the greatest increases observed in the cottonwood (2345 g m−2) and switchgrass (1818 g m−2). Biomass production in the smooth brome control did not change during the study period. Based on the 4th-year samples, standing pools of P closely paralleled total plant biomass and root surface area with cottonwood accumulating the greatest amount of P at 19.4 g m−2 compared to 4.3 g m−2 for the smooth brome control. Estimates of potential P export via biomass harvest from a mixed buffer over a 4-year interval were 101 kg ha−1 compared to 62 kg ha−1 for the smooth brome control; a 63% increase in export capacity due largely to the inclusion of cottonwood. Addition of a fast growing woody species combined with periodic biomass harvests has the potential to reduce P movement to surface waters.",78,3,239,251,Riparian zone; Woody plant; Eutrophication; Shoot; Riparian buffer; Biomass; Panicum virgatum; Phosphorus; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,http://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND43940253 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10705-007-9088-4 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20073151788 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10705-007-9088-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-007-9088-4,,10.1007/s10705-007-9088-4,2042915662,,0,002-937-270-631-538; 004-376-749-415-824; 008-679-847-035-300; 010-812-686-060-661; 012-497-428-341-538; 013-595-468-389-611; 021-844-470-829-932; 027-397-118-867-40X; 029-294-447-653-235; 032-858-534-937-26X; 037-205-411-011-719; 045-911-529-688-897; 046-104-331-252-268; 049-582-960-065-890; 052-950-627-235-061; 056-580-414-502-20X; 057-586-835-109-493; 068-600-446-358-813; 074-088-259-080-980; 081-139-408-185-999; 087-396-559-360-77X; 090-572-305-875-544; 092-237-347-990-852; 105-059-613-706-684; 105-270-727-269-180; 105-326-312-066-744; 122-215-324-073-68X; 127-716-913-098-399; 129-489-943-197-772; 146-014-119-361-420; 154-645-916-502-450; 162-322-767-842-77X; 169-607-559-923-667; 180-524-585-737-168; 183-621-826-466-404,48

In the South-Western France, the evolution of agricultural practices occurs in two opposite ways. On one hand, the intensification of agriculture leads to simplify the landscape by hedgerows removal, grasslands ploughing and drainage for corn cultivation. On the other hand, the decreasing numbers of cattle and sheep conduct the less fertile parts of the territory to evolve into fallow. These two processes are closely linked on a same territory and important interactions exist between intensive agricultural areas and semi-natural communities. To understand the importance of these interactions and their role in ecological stability of landscapes, we use passerine bird communities as an ecological indicator. We modelized the relationships between birds and landscape structure from 256 releves. Each releve includes a bird count point of 20 mn and a description of the landscape feature on the surrounding 6.25 ha. An ordination of the releves along the main ecological gradients was realized using Correspondence Analysis. Then, these ordinations where related to the landscape structure with Stepwise and Multiple Regression Analysis. The rate of woody area, the hedgerow network complexity and the rate of fallow land are the main ecological gradients. We have used this model to measure the importance of the changes induced on landscape by a range of management practices differing in intensity. To achieve this aim we compare the displacement of 116 releves along the ecological gradients between 1983 and 1988. The changes occurring both in bird composition and landscape structure reveal the ecological impacts of the different management practices (hedgerow removal, drainage, ploughing, decreasing grazing pressure). We examine the behaviour of ecological diversity of landscape units differing in structure and use.",6,3,195,211,Agriculture; Ecological indicator; Ordination; Ecosystem diversity; Ecology; Geography; Hedgerow removal; Grazing pressure; Ecological stability; Landscape ecology,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00130031 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00130031,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00130031,,10.1007/bf00130031,2153846274,,0,002-817-587-407-853; 015-351-611-682-557; 021-933-813-475-043; 034-718-009-214-643; 051-897-445-047-338; 058-511-186-746-520; 064-468-840-588-413; 068-985-051-096-126; 071-445-234-673-708; 075-474-380-039-308; 085-372-195-731-912; 089-620-933-912-041; 089-846-981-804-872; 094-565-155-161-326; 104-929-055-646-348; 110-766-047-364-379; 111-628-243-264-528; 115-082-450-395-073; 125-520-693-427-113; 157-128-290-187-295; 189-910-785-921-288,52

Winter is a season of highest concentration of birds and hunting pressure but woodcock precise habitat requirements are poorly known. It is crucial to assess threats and to develop sustainable management options for the conservation of woodcock populations. During three consecutive winters, we monitored 65 individual woodcocks fitted with radio-tags in Brittany, France. Habitat selection was analysed using GIS and compositional analysis, in relation to vegetation types, soil variables (humus types) and the abundance of their main prey (earthworms). Woodcocks used different habitats diurnally and nocturnally, generally preferring areas with high earthworm biomass. Diurnal habitat selection in forests was associated with humus type (preference for mulls, rich in earthworms) and dense shrub strata (better protection). Hedges with a high density of trees and shrub were also important habitat. At night, grazed meadows were the preferred habitat, containing five times higher biomass of earthworms compared to cultivated fields. Sustainable management of populations requires protection and management of habitats that incorporates food and cover. Forestry practices should preserve rich humus types and coppices by choosing tree species that ameliorate the soil and soil tilling. Changes in landscapes and intensive agricultural practices are current threats to woodcock populations: destruction of hedges, decrease of permanent grazed meadows, impoverishment of soils fauna biomasses from ploughing and chemical applications. However, woodcocks may benefit from the recent development of set-asides, grass field-borders and simplified farm practices (no-tillage and direct sowing).",122,3,479,490,Biomass (ecology); Fauna; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Shrub; Conservation status; Woodcock; Eurasian woodcock; Humus; Agroforestry,,,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00187876 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320704004033 http://centrostudinatura.it/public2/documenti/54-89839.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2004.08.011,,10.1016/j.biocon.2004.08.011,2036230514,,0,003-251-732-418-644; 004-252-761-377-336; 005-748-037-104-033; 008-688-290-389-623; 014-692-952-418-083; 015-522-041-159-134; 018-133-062-485-158; 020-131-452-110-549; 020-457-500-141-156; 022-721-184-238-409; 025-803-220-333-090; 025-867-015-724-116; 026-891-213-952-431; 034-922-021-577-840; 045-579-409-179-295; 046-449-544-451-037; 047-294-564-965-302; 057-841-120-726-514; 061-401-711-406-024; 064-641-412-673-036; 068-624-903-053-676; 072-595-505-644-184; 072-635-809-451-975; 074-623-606-398-822; 074-793-529-288-006; 078-116-977-303-676; 088-462-063-897-61X; 091-553-303-858-460; 092-595-088-242-701; 093-794-609-105-373; 095-126-463-863-444; 107-445-112-678-396; 113-619-894-693-826; 117-751-764-490-696; 120-203-561-573-441; 121-691-035-270-645; 129-506-863-843-860; 132-048-390-996-279; 136-816-007-966-101; 146-915-991-259-726; 149-200-651-727-319; 151-585-907-143-715; 156-066-906-763-397; 157-084-304-601-097; 160-397-778-425-713; 162-483-831-467-36X; 162-916-722-972-077; 164-457-910-994-823; 179-048-991-295-983; 181-180-948-145-621; 184-505-614-035-07X; 185-265-231-534-37X; 190-958-094-312-334; 194-487-262-497-006,37

Tate,"A survey of storm runoff fecal coliform bacteria (FCB) from working farm and ranch pastures is presented in conjunction with a survey of FCB in manure management systems (MMS). The cross-sectional survey of pasture runoff was conducted on 34 pastures on five different dairies over 2 yr under varying conditions of precipitation, slope, manure management, and use of conservation practices such as vegetative filter strips. The MMS cross-sectional survey consisted of samples collected during 1 yr on nine different dairies from six loafing barns, nine primary lagoons, 12 secondary lagoons, and six irrigation sample points. Pasture runoff samples were additionally analyzed for Cryptosporidium sp. and Giardia duodenalis, whereby detectable concentrations occurred sporadically at higher FCB concentrations resulting in poor correlations with FCB. Prevalence of both parasites was lower relative to high-use areas studied simultaneously on these same farms. Application of manure to pastures more than 2 wk in advance of storm-associated runoff was related to a > or =80% reduction in FCB concentration and load compared to applications within 2 wk before a runoff event. For every 10 m of buffer length, a 24% reduction in FCB concentration was documented. A one-half (75%), one (90%), and two (99%) log10 reduction in manure FCB concentration was observed for manure holding times in MMS of approximately 20, 66, and 133 d, respectively. These results suggest that there are several management and conservation practices for working farms that may result in reduced FCB fluxes from agricultural operations.",39,5,1782,1789,Agriculture; Fecal coliform; Pasture; Coliform bacteria; Manure management; Manure; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Agronomy; Irrigation,,Animals; California; Dairying; Manure; Water Microbiology,Manure,Marin Community Foundation; California Sea Grant Program,https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103340661.html https://ucdavis.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/management-of-microbial-contamination-in-storm-runoff-from-califo https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103340661 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth_Tate/publication/47659303_Management_of_Microbial_Contamination_in_Storm_Runoff_from_California_Coastal_Dairy_Pastures/links/0046351b726cb216aa000000.pdf https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2009.0464 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21043283 http://lshs.tamu.edu/docs/lshs/end-notes/management%20of%20microbial%20contamination%20in%20storm%20runoff%20fro-0225609548/management%20of%20microbial%20contamination%20in%20storm%20runoff%20from%20ca%20dairy%20pastures.pdf https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/21043283,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2009.0464,21043283,10.2134/jeq2009.0464,2031115349,,0,002-150-511-763-98X; 003-710-370-045-27X; 008-404-996-745-311; 008-985-146-954-457; 009-948-652-874-197; 011-648-696-888-176; 014-801-153-938-525; 015-617-377-595-003; 016-100-591-389-600; 021-824-107-956-621; 028-822-124-866-172; 038-088-296-969-193; 043-220-974-649-508; 047-858-222-781-90X; 051-285-296-375-882; 051-814-821-041-364; 062-427-769-001-566; 064-321-476-382-42X; 071-940-275-142-733; 077-543-727-367-378; 079-547-335-144-379; 091-130-971-427-143; 110-261-673-897-11X; 110-273-471-720-293; 110-726-387-282-875; 114-798-386-232-524; 139-686-152-452-357; 140-402-720-483-193; 177-517-070-183-860,9

Jia; Robert O. Evans; J. T. Smith,"Lagoon effluent is routinely applied to agricultural fields as fertilizer to utilize nutrients derived from animal manures. In humid regions, effluent is also applied to fields in order to manage the lagoon stage within acceptable levels. To minimize the risk of applied nutrients being transported to surface waters, best management practices such as vegetative buffers and controlled drainage are often recommended. This paper presents the results of a field study to evaluate the effectiveness of controlled drainage and vegetative buffers in reducing the transport of wastewater nutrients from land application fields. Swine lagoon effluent was spray irrigated to Bermudagrass fields drained by a parallel ditch system. Drainage outflow was monitored continuously for a 3 year period. Vegetative buffers reduced the average concentration of phosphorus by about 30%, but the average concentration of nitrogen was not affected.

Martin; S. Cook; J.W. Nduhiu; N.K. Kaushik; H. R. Whiteley,"In this study we investigated the nitrate (NO3−–N) attenuating capabilities of two headwater stream riparian zones in southern Ontario. Peak concentrations of groundwater NO3−–N at sites adjacent the Speed River and Carroll Creek occurred in spring. Both study areas showed a capacity to deplete essentially 100% of NO3−–N from subsurface waters. Attenuation was concentrated in the leading 20 – 30 m of the riparian zones, suggesting the sites had a significant, unused potential for NO3−–N depletion. At Carroll Creek, a comparative study of NO3−–N concentrations from differently vegetated riparian zones was performed. Both woody and grassy riparian areas demonstrated a decrease in NO3−–N concentrations below the limits of detection (<0.02 mg/L). However, the woody riparian zone depleted NO3−–N over a shorter distance than the grassy riparian zone, suggesting it had a greater unused potential for attenuation.",24,2,125,138,Riparian zone; Geology; Riparian forest; Nitrate; Spring (hydrology); Groundwater nitrate; Hydrology; STREAMS; Groundwater,,,,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6934893 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.4296/cwrj2402125 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4296/cwrj2402125,http://dx.doi.org/10.4296/cwrj2402125,,10.4296/cwrj2402125,1984385480,,0,005-290-449-929-902; 005-362-279-630-448; 018-219-566-672-229; 021-187-528-186-865; 038-659-320-814-260; 040-198-568-662-726; 040-935-957-450-37X; 041-559-307-895-617; 068-997-932-046-194; 073-927-313-505-491; 076-826-572-086-275; 078-146-066-944-787; 079-041-458-901-327; 087-138-533-405-771; 116-392-527-740-93X; 119-725-206-462-264; 121-468-243-703-60X; 132-186-585-542-192; 150-539-908-471-485,13

Results indicated that, in typical Italian agricultural conditions, spray drift in vineyards occurs at a distance of more than 24 m and adequate buffer zones are required to protect surface water bodies from direct contamination. The presence of tree rows in front of the water body inside the agricultural field, against the main wind direction, resulted in a very high reduction of the spray drift and of the ecotoxicological risk for aquatic ecosystem. In addition, a comparison between the data obtained in the experiment and the Drift Calculator procedure showed that the model failed when the procedure is used for short distances.

In this study, we examinedenitrification in four riparian ecosystems common to the Valley and Ridgephysiographic province in Pennsylvania, USA. The sites exhibit differentvegetation, are underlain by different rock types, and are downgradient offarm fields. Mean site denitrification rates ranging from 0.6 to 1.9 mgN/kg soil/day were measured using intact core incubation techniques. Thethree riparian sites covered with grass each exhibited greaterdenitrification rates than the wooded site. Denitrification rate wascorrelated with moisture content but not with nitrate-N or organic carboncontents. Denitrification rates were greatest near the soil surface and atpositions nearest the stream. Rates decreased uniformly with distance awayfrom the stream and also with depth in the soil for each site. While patternsof nitrate-N, moisture, and organic carbon content differ among the sites,their combined effects on denitrification support the observed, consistentdenitrification rate pattern.KEY WORDS: Denitrification; Riparian ecosystems",21,2,283,290,Ecosystem; Riparian zone; Total organic carbon; Soil science; Moisture; Water content; Ridge; Hydrology; Environmental science; STREAMS; Denitrification,,,,,https://eurekamag.com/research/008/429/008429493.php https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs002679900027 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9008079 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/9008079,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002679900027,9008079,10.1007/s002679900027,2087631202,,0,000-142-952-017-146; 009-379-307-440-518; 015-514-563-181-208; 018-219-566-672-229; 021-187-528-186-865; 023-889-860-756-398; 024-209-120-607-316; 035-485-421-334-091; 038-659-320-814-260; 040-665-244-257-257; 049-789-764-785-282; 053-093-567-362-36X; 080-589-148-600-106; 087-511-807-375-462; 136-598-205-806-683; 141-101-347-131-583; 150-539-908-471-485; 165-303-507-116-988,18

However, it is little known how the interaction of these local variables (amount of hedges and organic management) with landscape scale variables affects birds. We selected paired conventional and organic winter wheat fields and meadows in each of 10 landscapes in Germany. Birds were surveyed in the fields and in the adjoining hedges. More bird species occurred in organic than in conventional fields regardless of land-use type (wheat fields and meadows). However, hedge length had a much stronger effect on bird richness than organic farmland management. We found an interaction of landscape complexity and hedge length in that hedge length enhanced bird richness only in case of simple landscapes (<17% semi-natural areas within a 500 m radius around the centre of bird survey plots). In more complex landscapes the local effect of hedge length levelled off because bird richness was high even without local hedges. Therefore, adding hedges or introducing organic farming practices should be primarily promoted in simple landscapes, where it really makes a difference for biodiversity.",143,9,2020,2027,Organic farming; Biodiversity; Wildlife conservation; Ecology; Geography; Grassland; Land use; Species richness; Agroforestry; Agroecosystem; Arable land,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320710002193 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103257215,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2010.05.005,,10.1016/j.biocon.2010.05.005,2118562479,,0,000-140-507-815-44X; 001-770-159-081-488; 002-234-862-186-238; 003-251-732-418-644; 005-789-241-565-890; 007-416-181-403-689; 008-225-619-668-580; 009-158-373-166-597; 009-380-286-784-968; 011-984-573-942-606; 013-746-156-265-893; 014-373-326-060-805; 016-421-756-148-512; 020-385-309-424-588; 020-681-006-847-192; 023-103-648-255-011; 023-310-699-181-261; 027-529-492-407-907; 030-831-977-852-027; 031-592-787-048-258; 032-245-730-539-873; 032-926-424-493-946; 034-922-021-577-840; 036-224-006-435-531; 037-866-621-012-697; 037-882-648-829-701; 044-307-871-990-779; 044-365-740-612-108; 044-531-648-558-840; 045-077-143-858-513; 047-032-573-228-291; 047-570-945-634-927; 053-787-579-034-941; 054-154-620-382-507; 055-208-871-302-118; 056-099-523-856-735; 057-720-330-037-206; 057-941-074-733-032; 058-416-961-649-911; 060-114-103-966-089; 060-190-757-297-843; 061-594-202-158-089; 062-417-263-153-926; 062-501-527-775-318; 063-317-520-026-847; 064-454-510-982-621; 065-357-116-922-518; 068-452-604-669-157; 070-807-130-928-517; 073-798-803-161-275; 074-197-517-203-385; 074-225-773-604-407; 075-592-090-478-123; 076-278-055-254-459; 076-863-055-982-955; 077-537-180-667-797; 078-179-226-288-223; 081-187-254-788-856; 082-139-829-269-53X; 084-658-793-481-471; 086-063-765-305-77X; 086-525-130-009-786; 086-560-114-271-630; 091-415-969-356-605; 094-746-201-098-704; 097-540-703-901-873; 098-035-451-831-547; 104-575-396-419-535; 105-145-742-902-746; 113-464-996-560-182; 115-606-139-771-296; 118-277-118-567-565; 119-209-557-350-650; 124-803-241-350-796; 133-858-248-195-498; 145-728-200-767-581; 147-069-899-966-299; 147-888-609-293-647; 149-200-651-727-319; 150-827-413-891-88X; 151-297-685-517-366; 163-015-818-947-376; 166-826-142-461-007; 179-048-991-295-983; 190-124-623-460-164; 197-392-866-862-614,126

Declining populations of UK grassland flora and fauna have been attributed to intensification of agricultural management practices, including changes in cutting, fertilizer, grazing and drainage regimes. We aimed to develop field margin management practices that could reverse declines in intensively managed grassland biodiversity that would have application in the UK and Europe. Here we focus on one aspect of grassland biodiversity, the beetles. 2. In four intensively managed livestock farms in south-west England, 10-m wide field margins in existing grasslands were managed to create seven treatments of increasing sward architectural complexity. This was achieved through combinations of inorganic (NPK) fertilizer, cattle grazing, and timing and height of cutting. To examine the potential influence of complexity on faunal diversity, beetles were identified to species level from suction samples taken between 2003 and 2005, and their assemblage structure was related to margin management, floral assemblages and sward architecture. 3. Beetle abundance, and species richness and evenness were influenced by margin management treatment and its interaction with year. Correlations with sward architecture and the percentage cover of dominant forbs and grasses were also found. Functional groups of the beetles showed different responses to the management treatments. In particular, higher proportional abundances of seed/flower-feeding guilds were found in treatments not receiving NPK fertilizer. 4. The assemblage structure was shown to respond to margin management treatments, sward architecture and the percentage cover of dominant forbs and grasses. The most extensively managed treatments were characterized by distinct successional trajectories from the control treatment. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study provides management options suitable for use within agri-environment schemes intended to improve faunal diversity associated with intensively managed lowland grasslands. Field margins receiving either no management or a single July silage cut were shown to support greater abundances and species richness of beetles, although subtler modifications of conventional management may also be beneficial, for example the absence of NPK fertilizer while maintaining grazing and silage cutting systems.",44,1,60,69,Fauna; Species evenness; Biodiversity; Forb; Grassland; Grazing; Species richness; Agroforestry; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01258.x https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01258.x https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01258.x/abstract http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/9399/ http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01258.x/full https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01258.x https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/162122168.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01258.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01258.x,1588048306,,0,003-251-732-418-644; 007-827-850-871-938; 014-162-369-478-70X; 014-591-903-776-324; 016-421-756-148-512; 019-750-716-538-504; 030-453-266-652-445; 032-192-970-524-05X; 056-585-869-238-25X; 056-789-845-462-569; 058-743-931-737-265; 059-863-891-880-237; 065-161-518-246-802; 065-565-421-487-993; 071-363-274-178-219; 073-010-346-426-592; 076-425-702-964-164; 078-068-143-214-104; 082-407-432-481-039; 084-454-852-806-033; 089-253-154-997-777; 092-387-691-527-318; 097-940-408-467-683; 101-987-905-557-98X; 104-461-793-224-947; 110-673-327-117-273; 117-345-687-903-78X; 119-085-349-431-446; 127-029-369-930-692; 149-796-121-127-05X; 150-451-331-765-852; 179-939-285-820-217,80

A study of the seedbank and standing vegetation in 10 soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] fields, their adjacent boundaries, and adjoining woody hedgerows was undertaken in Ontario. The objective was to examine the composition of plants of conservation value and weedy species in these habitats. The seedbank of each habitat was determined from soil cores in quadrats located at regular intervals along transects, using the seedling emergence method in the greenhouse. The vegetation was surveyed in plots adjacent to the seedbank sampling areas. There was no significant difference in total species richness of vegetation or the seedbank among habitat types. However, there was a marked difference in species composition. In the seedbank, no difference in weed species richness among habitats was observed. In vegetation, however, fields harboured significantly more weedy species than adjacent boundaries and hedgerows.

One of the management options for this set-aside land was to leave it as an over-winter fallow with a naturally regenerated green cover. This study was designed to test whether such land was used by seed-eating bird species, populations of many of which have undergone recent severe declines. Five out of six declining species recorded in the study were found in significantly greater numbers on this habitat than would be expected if the birds were randomly distributed over the farmland landscape. The results of this study, covering a wide geographical area, reinforce previous findings of the importance of winter food sources, particularly over-winter stubble fields, to declining farmland seed-eaters. Proposed changes to the CAP under Agenda 2000 include the reduction of the obligatory set-aside rate to zero.

Sullivan; Druscilla S. Sullivan; H.M.A. Thistlewood,"Abstract We investigated the influence of linear habitats, three types of hedgerows and two types of field margins, on the small mammal community within a semi-arid agricultural landscape in south-central British Columbia, Canada. We examined whether abundance, species richness, and species diversity of small mammals in tree fruit orchards differed from linear, edge habitats along orchard margins. Our five edges spanned grassy to wooded habitats. Linear habitats were intensively sampled for vascular plants in 2003 and small mammal communities from 2003 to 2007. Vegetation and total abundance of small mammal species among three types of hedgerows were similar and population changes followed those within nearby apple orchards. Species richness and diversity of small mammals, however, were significantly higher in hedgerows than orchards. Fewer mammals occupied hedgerows with high volumes of herb and shrub biomass, but richness and diversity of mammals did increase with shrub volume. All seven species of small mammals were represented in the hedgerow communities, including two species at risk: the Great Basin pocket mouse Perognathus parvus and the western harvest mouse ( Reithrodontomys megalotis ). Two types of field margins (orchard-sagebrush and orchard-old field) along fencerows provided habitat for P . parvus . Field margins managed for herbaceous plant species along fencerows and other such linear configurations provided habitat for R. megalotis . Linear non-crop habitats should maintain the overall small mammal community, as well as the two species at risk, within this semi-arid agricultural landscape.",83,,54,61,Biodiversity; Habitat; Ecology; Alpha diversity; Shrub; Population; Species richness; Species diversity; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140196312001036 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140196312001036 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012JArEn..83...54S/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2012.03.003,,10.1016/j.jaridenv.2012.03.003,2034124477,,0,004-623-287-312-083; 006-999-936-124-604; 008-225-619-668-580; 012-115-765-872-472; 017-011-497-062-46X; 025-009-993-658-497; 026-162-389-848-750; 026-931-939-363-170; 028-786-603-965-607; 033-597-612-507-059; 034-024-620-732-510; 037-883-795-788-801; 039-270-311-852-944; 040-572-453-396-234; 043-062-864-287-955; 043-819-346-205-923; 044-787-040-138-476; 046-706-622-716-331; 047-800-573-929-302; 049-869-993-442-064; 061-401-711-406-024; 067-070-378-841-691; 068-452-604-669-157; 068-488-271-134-879; 071-112-182-713-097; 071-192-821-815-608; 071-604-253-914-381; 074-793-529-288-006; 080-727-692-222-199; 081-405-018-000-37X; 085-082-365-838-486; 093-818-216-109-633; 095-738-165-675-661; 095-877-317-702-391; 100-508-649-512-362; 101-150-316-380-050; 105-260-567-087-257; 111-928-690-137-058; 125-707-880-940-115; 135-649-556-815-160; 139-236-139-870-281; 142-238-278-183-673; 147-553-127-849-679; 149-637-084-258-22X; 161-425-757-559-60X; 171-939-686-679-559; 190-122-359-774-236; 191-606-159-560-281,13

J. P. Marshall,"Field margins are refugia for many species in arable landscapes, but are also affected by adjacent farming operations and by margin management. Botanical diversity in 117 hedge-bottoms on two neighbouring farms in Yatesbury, Wiltshire, UK, were studied in relation to boundary structure, hedge management practices and adjacent features on the farm to which they belong. The farms differed with regard to field margin and hedge management practices, but soil type and cropping patterns were very similar. Attention was also paid to effects of sown grass strips, coppicing and gapping-up of hedges and different approaches towards field margin management. Results indicated that there were no significant differences in woody species richness between the two farms, with hedges of similar composition. There was significantly higher herbaceous species diversity on the farm with grass strips. Multivariate analyses indicated that community differences were present, with a number of annual and biennial plant species predominating on the farm without grass margins. Principal components analysis (PCA), redundancy analysis (RDA) with forward selection and associated Monte-Carlo permutation tests, and stepwise linear regression showed the following. (1) Sown grass and/or wildflower strips adjacent to the hedge-bottom have a positive effect on species richness of the hedge-bottom vegetation. They also reduce the abundance in the hedge-bottom of Anisantha sterilis, Galium aparine, Poa trivialis and Urtica dioica, all four considered to be pernicious weed species. (2) Coppicing in combination with gapping-up of hedges increases species richness of the hedge-bottom vegetation and has a positive effect on floral diversity in the landscape. (3) Diversity in management, boundary structure and adjacent features within one farm increases the floral diversity at the farm scale.

There are indications that small mammal populations in Europe are declining due to the intensification of agriculture. According to national legislation, farmers in Switzerland have to cultivate at least 7% of their land as ecological compensation areas and, thus, some alternative habitats that are possibly beneficial for small mammals have been created. In this study, we estimated the diversity and density of small mammals on two types of conventional farmland field types (artificial grassland and autumn-sown wheat) and three types of ecological compensation areas (wild-flower strips, herbaceous strips and low-intensity meadows) by use of capture-recapture in March, May and July 2003. The common vole Microtus arvalis was the most abundant and predominant species in all habitat types except in herbaceous strips, which harboured the highest diversity with six species caught. In March the density of sma...",13,2,150,158,Agriculture; Food chain; Habitat; Ecology; Grassland; Vole; Microtus; Intensive farming; Agroforestry; Biology; Predator,,,,,https://www.bioone.org/doi/10.2981/0909-6396%282007%2913%5B150%3AIOECAF%5D2.0.CO%3B2 http://dx.doi.org/10.2981/0909-6396(2007)13[150:ioecaf]2.0.co;2 https://www.bioone.org/doi/pdf/10.2981/0909-6396(2007)13[150:IOECAF]2.0.CO;2 https://bioone.org/journals/wildlife-biology/volume-13/issue-2/0909-6396(2007)13%5b150%3aIOECAF%5d2.0.CO%3b2/Importance-of-ecological-compensation-areas-for-small-mammals-in-intensively/10.2981/0909-6396(2007)13%5B150:IOECAF%5D2.0.CO;2.full,http://dx.doi.org/10.2981/0909-6396(2007)13[150:ioecaf]2.0.co;2,,10.2981/0909-6396(2007)13[150:ioecaf]2.0.co;2,2110658298,,0,001-577-088-583-16X; 004-133-951-421-172; 008-702-225-317-314; 013-270-209-241-22X; 015-984-246-082-878; 016-421-756-148-512; 019-288-633-084-597; 022-299-568-450-790; 023-127-912-580-646; 031-178-344-744-314; 048-381-262-701-215; 050-224-806-567-10X; 051-027-714-551-243; 059-572-625-611-27X; 066-484-494-196-179; 068-488-271-134-879; 070-582-747-582-275; 071-192-821-815-608; 086-009-552-460-111; 110-932-132-476-771; 117-274-614-921-471; 128-240-773-965-619; 187-274-321-545-969; 188-284-638-752-718,83

Stevens; John Quinton; Alison Bailey; C. Deasy; Martyn Silgram; D. R. Jackson,"Runoff, sediment, total phosphorus and total dissolved phosphorus losses in overland flow were measured for two years on unbounded plots cropped with wheat and oats.; ; Half of the field was cultivated with minimum tillage (shallow tillage with a tine cultivator) and half was conventionally ploughed. Within each cultivation treatment there were different treatment areas (TAs). In the first year of the experiment, one TA was cultivated up and down the slope, one TA was cultivated on the contour, with a beetle bank acting as a vegetative barrier partway up the slope, and one had a mixed direction cultivation treatment, with cultivation and drilling conducted up and down the slope and all subsequent operations conducted on the contour. In the second year, this mixed treatment was replaced with contour cultivation.; ; Results showed no significant reduction in runoff, sediment losses or total phosphorus losses from minimum tillage when compared to the conventional plough treatment, but there were increased losses of total dissolved phosphorus with minimum tillage.; ; The mixed direction cultivation treatment increased surface runoff and losses of sediment and phosphorus. Increasing surface roughness with contour cultivation reduced surface runoff compared to up and down slope cultivation in both the plough and minimum tillage treatment areas, but this trend was not significant. Sediment and phosphorus losses in the contour cultivation treatment followed a very similar pattern to runoff. Combining contour cultivation with a vegetative barrier in the form of a beetle bank to reduce slope length resulted in a non-significant reduction in surface runoff, sediment and total phosphorus when compared to up and down slope cultivation, but there was a clear trend towards reduced losses. However, the addition of a beetle bank did not provide a significant reduction in runoff, sediment losses or total phosphorus losses when compared to contour cultivation, suggesting only a marginal additional benefit. The economic implications for farmers of the different treatment options are investigated in order to assess their suitability for implementation at a field scale.",106,1,145,151,Erosion; Tillage; Minimum tillage; Plough; Sediment; Environmental science; Beetle bank; Surface runoff; Phosphorus; Agronomy,,,,,http://oro.open.ac.uk/19065/ https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103033742 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103033742.html https://core.ac.uk/display/82911763 http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/9215/ https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/20028/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167198709001007 https://core.ac.uk/download/82911763.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2009.04.009,,10.1016/j.still.2009.04.009,1988580523,,0,000-614-931-902-640; 007-802-276-658-487; 020-507-352-968-233; 032-482-587-227-015; 035-608-978-609-635; 042-765-344-128-744; 057-586-835-109-493; 061-403-908-682-398; 072-899-814-675-85X; 080-034-207-145-58X; 080-581-329-922-191; 087-012-594-389-011; 099-961-620-642-456; 122-747-683-839-066; 130-460-674-953-07X; 142-638-284-402-935; 145-628-223-693-935; 153-368-929-556-854,60

Adams; L. Wes Burger; Samuel K. Riffell,"We studied the effects of periodic disturbance (prescribed burning and light disking) and landscape composition on nest density and success for grassland birds in agricultural conservation buffers in southeastern United States agroecosystems. During the 2007-2009 breeding seasons, we located 387 nests in buffers of a northeast Mississippi agroecosystem. Dickcissel (Spiza americana) and red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) were the most common nesting species. Time since disturbance influenced nest densities of dickcissels and red-winged blackbirds; densities were lesser during the first growing season post- disturbance but increased during the second growing season post-burn. Nest densities for both species were least in buffers adjacent to woodland. Inclusion of disturbance did not improve models of dickcissel and red- winged blackbird nest survival, suggesting that disturbance influenced nesting density, but not nesting outcomes. Amount of grassland surrounding dickcissel nests was positively associated with nest survival, but confidence intervals included zero indicating effects were not strong. Although distance to nearest crop or developed edge were included in competing models of red-winged blackbird nest survival, their effects were negligible. Agricultural conservation buffers will best serve breeding grassland bird populations if they are established in areas with minimal woodland cover, maximize total grassland in the landscape, and are maintained with prescribed burning. These results will help characterize the contribution of agricultural conservation buffers in agroecosystems of the southeastern United States. 2013 The Wildlife Society.",77,6,1213,1220,Growing season; Nest; Ecology; Woodland; Geography; Grassland; Disturbance (geology); Agelaius; Agroecosystem; Prescribed burn,,,,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jwmg.568 https://www.cavs.msstate.edu/publications/docs/2013/07/12570Adams_et_al_2013_Disturbance_and_landscape_effects_on_nests_in_buffers.pdf http://www.gri.msstate.edu/publications/docs/2013/07/12570Adams_et_al_2013_Disturbance_and_landscape_effects_on_nests_in_buffers.pdf http://www.cavs.msstate.edu/publications/docs/2013/07/12570Adams_et_al_2013_Disturbance_and_landscape_effects_on_nests_in_buffers.pdf https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jwmg.568 https://works.bepress.com/heidi-adams/3/ https://www.gri.msstate.edu/publications/docs/2013/07/12570Adams_et_al_2013_Disturbance_and_landscape_effects_on_nests_in_buffers.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.568,,10.1002/jwmg.568,2168378335,,0,000-788-024-098-732; 007-289-445-927-744; 011-287-863-694-168; 019-561-810-281-087; 019-622-915-734-27X; 020-831-220-848-824; 027-126-332-563-55X; 029-067-159-542-004; 035-482-611-431-868; 039-638-041-216-835; 063-872-742-080-972; 067-318-393-532-05X; 068-811-888-710-634; 071-829-242-397-54X; 080-295-502-998-134; 089-483-582-783-963; 093-501-924-946-904; 095-104-916-898-838; 107-234-149-704-009; 107-258-912-245-333; 111-637-517-388-46X; 111-770-649-109-293; 128-130-250-855-94X; 133-025-020-758-454; 136-446-153-249-957; 139-645-597-883-642; 145-460-316-879-599; 157-980-673-029-212; 160-534-378-242-887; 164-686-630-818-824; 172-791-396-044-246; 173-117-656-524-396; 179-633-672-328-204; 186-762-055-197-346; 191-508-311-193-465,21

Conner; Sarah N. Heiss; Linda Berlin,"Climate change impacts local agricultural systems in detectable and distinguishable ways from large-scale shifts in water, land, and weather patterns to regionally specific distributions of weeds, pests, and diseases. Best management practices for adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change include modifications to farm production through adjusted intensity and product types and changing land use through crop siting and tillage practices. Farmer perceptions of risk and profitability of best management practices are key determinants of adoption, which traditional incentive programs like the Environmental Quality Incentive Program attempt to address by providing financial and technical support. To ensure that payments offered through these programs that maximize adoption, regional incentive payments must be based upon locally established costs. This paper focuses on the cost of implementing and maintaining climate change specific best management practices (CCBMPs) for twelve diverse farms in Vermont. Specifically, three CCBMPs for Vermont are examined: cover cropping, management intensive rotational grazing (MIRG), and riparian buffer strips. Results show the average cost for cover cropping is $129.24/acre, MIRG is $79.82/acre, and a tree based riparian buffer strip cost $807.33/acre. We conclude that existing incentive payments for cover cropping and MIRG are below costs, likely resulting in under-adoption.",5,3,879,900,Environmental resource management; Effects of global warming; Agriculture; Business; Natural resource economics; Riparian buffer; Average cost; Incentive; Incentive program; Land use; Environmental quality,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jagris/v5y2015i3p879-900d56040.html https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/5/3/879 https://core.ac.uk/display/89243015 https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/5/3/879/pdf https://doaj.org/article/f7c58091789c43c7af94f14985d5b2a3 https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:gam:jagris:v:5:y:2015:i:3:p:879-900:d:56040 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6468335,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture5030879,,10.3390/agriculture5030879,1944378831,,0,002-406-419-873-533; 003-077-098-980-099; 003-609-815-536-842; 003-782-698-824-034; 008-727-802-749-514; 009-442-779-260-039; 009-498-895-083-319; 009-794-028-892-958; 013-247-947-978-121; 013-529-545-392-457; 018-860-399-233-790; 019-759-269-996-36X; 024-172-866-029-173; 026-434-593-766-468; 027-059-338-389-006; 035-457-925-343-620; 044-963-851-868-27X; 048-089-320-614-155; 058-129-332-299-304; 066-347-475-088-729; 066-362-550-364-355; 072-885-932-203-020; 074-929-589-983-940; 076-109-279-034-853; 081-593-940-760-857; 087-885-941-739-147; 100-303-885-689-988; 100-630-892-255-035; 102-787-977-282-794; 113-126-008-240-529; 115-712-533-687-104; 117-444-085-501-63X; 119-231-549-527-314; 122-685-438-917-488; 127-482-000-217-227; 128-682-045-763-662; 133-023-994-855-974; 148-283-091-056-309; 148-763-016-584-112; 159-418-585-694-903; 161-625-592-498-103; 163-499-763-436-029; 167-817-775-800-285; 174-815-971-870-103; 178-143-333-549-901; 196-040-050-917-656,7

Glyphosate was applied to a randomised block design field experiment comprising 360, 720 and 1440 g glyphosate AE ha-1 treatments and an unsprayed control. Spiders were sampled in each month from June to October 1998. Spider abundance was significantly lower in all the treatments than in the unsprayed control. Abundance was also significantly lower in the 720 and 1440 g treatments than in the 360 g treatment. No significant difference could be detected between the 720 and 1440 g treatments. Poisson regression models showed that patterns of decline in L tenuis were related to increasing dead vegetation and decreasing vegetation height.

The creation and sympathetic management of edges could improve abundance, diversity, and functional composition of farmland communities. Moreover, many species of arthropods inhabiting these habitats are natural enemies of crop pests and could play a valuable role in biological control. The aim of this research was to investigate the response of ground beetle assemblages to different management regimes in the rice field banks of an intensive agricultural area of northern Italy. Between May and November 2010, we collected carabids in 13 paddy banks (5 uncut, 4 mown twice, 4 cut monthly during June–September) by means of pitfall traps. Frequent cutting operations favoured assemblages dominated by generalist, mobile species, while more specialized ground beetles, such as predatory and short-winged ones, were associated with an absence or low levels of human disturbance. Our results suggest that environmentally friendly managed banks could help to ameliorate the persistence of species with poor dispersal ability and predator populations.

Feber; David W. Macdonald,"Improving the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes is essential for reversing declines in farmland biodiversity. Crucial to achieving this is identifying management options that are practical and beneficial to biodiversity, and understanding the influence of the surrounding landscape. We used data on abundance and species richness of farmland macro-moths, many of which are declining, and trait-based analyses on their feeding guild, mobility and conservation status, to explore local- and landscape-scale effects of two farmland features (extended-width field margins and hedgerow trees) and surrounding farmland intensification. Macro-moths were light trapped at 48 fixed sites on 16 farms, over 4 years, within a 1200-km2 area of lowland UK farmland. Sites belonged to one of four experimental groups that differed in their combinations of hedgerow tree presence and field margin width. Hedgerow trees and extended-width field margins locally increased species richness, but not abundance, of macro-moths, irrespective of each other's presence. Overall, species richness and abundance were not affected by agricultural intensification, as measured by the amount of arable land in the surrounding landscape. Sedentary moths showed double the species richness, but were half as abundant as mobile moths. Both groups responded positively to extended-width margin and hedgerow tree presence. The effect of hedgerow trees was particularly strong for shrub- and/or tree-feeding species. Analyses based on the conservation status of moths demonstrated that agricultural intensification lowered the species richness of nationally severely declining UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species and the abundance of both nationally moderately declining and priority species. These effects were most pronounced at the 0·8-km radius scale. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the presence of extended-width field margins and hedgerow trees, possibly promoted by agri-environment schemes targeting their implementation at relatively small spatial scales (0·8 km), may help mitigate negative effects of agricultural intensification on macro-moths. A wide range of other taxa feed on macro-moths and may therefore indirectly benefit from these features. Nevertheless, taxa differ widely in their mobility and measures mitigating biodiversity loss may need to be targeted at multiple spatial scales to maximize their effectiveness for multiple taxa.",49,6,1396,1404,Biodiversity; Ecology; Geography; Shrub; Conservation status; Species richness; Agroforestry; Guild; Arable land; Biodiversity action plan; Abundance (ecology),,,,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02211.x https://core.ac.uk/display/34107466 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02211.x/abstract https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02211.x https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02211.x https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02211.x https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:142438 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02211.x%4010.1111/%28ISSN%291365-2656.INTERNATIONAL,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02211.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02211.x,2046891995,,0,001-563-107-875-364; 003-374-061-631-590; 007-159-731-641-426; 008-225-619-668-580; 009-350-570-544-69X; 010-777-820-136-567; 013-146-093-850-278; 014-474-574-603-445; 020-024-935-817-641; 022-507-131-733-994; 023-935-502-746-047; 025-582-508-690-146; 027-876-348-257-824; 028-339-428-035-968; 030-285-119-895-818; 034-662-603-831-951; 045-445-063-674-649; 050-170-086-535-191; 050-907-802-597-89X; 051-373-433-178-608; 051-685-596-945-405; 052-663-214-319-062; 055-139-003-028-896; 055-946-607-021-418; 056-099-523-856-735; 056-285-214-746-742; 056-526-760-182-619; 059-060-434-104-479; 059-502-071-789-055; 062-017-038-838-512; 063-614-772-363-816; 064-175-619-696-408; 065-687-321-113-981; 073-092-957-256-475; 074-793-529-288-006; 078-318-665-214-047; 080-568-587-872-709; 083-787-056-866-149; 084-662-423-262-089; 085-728-583-688-914; 090-175-098-524-004; 095-350-099-081-855; 102-366-533-082-155; 102-432-685-707-874; 108-632-928-694-196; 111-095-683-961-870; 114-480-653-531-829; 119-645-603-733-953; 120-032-310-180-623; 122-339-404-455-420; 124-319-214-482-940; 124-407-129-963-803; 131-432-458-569-848; 150-260-537-510-335; 173-190-727-399-715; 181-602-781-774-289; 191-655-657-500-549,71

This is of particular concern in agricultural landscapes, which combine increased levels of fragmentation with larger numbers of endangered species than other landscapes. Corridors (e.g. linear landscape elements) are a popular conservation strategy to counteract fragmentation effects. Grassy field margins (GFMs) have been established throughout Europe as part of agri-environmental schemes. The primary goal of these measures is to protect water quality, but it is suggested biodiversity may benefit via a corridor function. Being set up along watercourses, GFMs may spontaneously form a coherent network of corridors in agricultural landscapes. We tested this hypothesis by monitoring movement strategies of Meadow brown butterflies (Maniola jurtina L.) in GFMs. Results indicated that butterfly movement was facilitated by this new landscape element, supporting its corridor function. Mechanistically, dispersal occurred through foraging movements rather than movements adapted to dispersal. Spatial configurations of GFMs were also explored in a large agricultural area and demonstrated that the GFM policy is adequate to provide a corridor function.",166,1,102,109,Habitat fragmentation; Biodiversity; Foraging; Endangered species; Ecology; Fragmentation (computing); Geography; Butterfly; Buffer strip; Biological dispersal,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016788091100209X https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00826994 https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND500630281 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016788091100209X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2011.06.018,,10.1016/j.agee.2011.06.018,2037166098,,0,002-731-043-544-617; 004-355-918-923-334; 004-872-167-482-720; 005-924-843-721-378; 006-314-244-124-537; 007-351-842-611-246; 008-225-619-668-580; 008-790-802-053-113; 009-798-888-154-531; 012-338-039-886-640; 012-696-439-318-327; 012-829-257-381-049; 014-204-563-886-62X; 018-028-975-115-624; 018-860-777-046-547; 019-844-798-384-39X; 020-024-935-817-641; 022-042-304-889-392; 024-802-810-540-46X; 024-965-001-450-903; 025-374-575-728-38X; 026-174-115-285-450; 026-524-247-263-808; 027-926-257-471-473; 031-022-800-035-714; 032-502-062-020-869; 038-591-972-424-171; 041-472-282-203-343; 041-616-757-175-973; 041-730-915-398-953; 042-303-914-852-499; 043-455-371-359-823; 044-445-829-636-966; 044-972-594-158-502; 049-461-410-363-614; 050-137-130-449-043; 051-750-139-155-449; 056-064-713-708-207; 056-244-188-471-763; 058-965-130-329-871; 060-072-186-453-728; 060-679-385-902-62X; 064-299-112-132-157; 071-000-612-789-205; 072-547-204-496-863; 073-256-571-154-968; 075-182-328-430-399; 075-774-949-566-343; 077-063-381-537-524; 084-168-759-738-323; 089-157-774-673-124; 094-228-604-585-435; 097-335-920-738-491; 109-286-048-134-980; 111-886-353-360-176; 117-471-179-191-082; 121-009-467-056-402; 126-209-006-871-875; 128-033-881-987-944; 132-653-145-372-847; 135-051-503-044-44X; 138-892-897-078-698; 140-646-074-090-571; 148-654-609-558-558; 149-692-542-021-839; 150-325-162-873-23X; 156-547-582-169-232; 174-932-284-758-200,30

Dover; Tim H. Sparks; J.N. Greatorex-Davies,"In Britain, much emphasis has been placed on conserving butterfly species in specialized habitats, since this is where most of it‘s threatened butterflies exist, whilst the wider countryside has been largely overlooked. However, there is increasing awareness that small improvements to the dominant landscape could potentially reap huge benefits to the populations of many of Britain‘s butterfly species. Recent studies have also stressed the importance of the landscape scale in the conservation of butterflies in small fragmented habitats. In this paper, we examine data from a variety of sources and conclude that the importance of shelter in open landscapes may be underestimated since recording is often restricted to the optimum conditions suggested by the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme. In less favourable conditions, butterflies may place greater reliance on those components of the landscape offering shelter. In light of the current policy of agricultural de-intensification we discuss how modifications to our current landscapes could benefit a wide range of species.",1,2,89,97,Agriculture; Biodiversity; Entomology; Habitat; Ecology; Range (biology); Geography; Threatened species; Butterfly; Animal ecology; Agroforestry,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1018487127174,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1018487127174,,10.1023/a:1018487127174,74130017,,0,044-445-829-636-966; 073-256-571-154-968; 075-638-674-736-334; 081-254-087-368-80X; 082-389-624-773-160; 120-686-576-642-154; 156-312-302-958-776; 171-352-683-438-394,133

A two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) of the vegetation types in 785 boundaries of study fields as well as surrounding fields resulted in five groups. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was built to investigate the effects of field boundary vegetation types on the abundance of S. rubrovittatus.

T. Moore; Robert Kröger; Martin A. Locke; Richard E. Lizotte; Sam Testa; Charles M. Cooper,"Vegetated buffers of different designs are often used as edge-of-field treatment practices to remove pesticides that may be entrained in agricultural runoff. However, buffer system efficacy in pesticide runoff mitigation varies widely due to a multitude of factors including, but not limited to, pesticide chemistry, vegetation composition, and hydrology. Two experimental systems, a control (no vegetation) and a grass–wetland buffer system, were evaluated for their ability to retain diazinon and permethrin associated with a simulated storm runoff. The two systems were equally inefficient at retaining diazinon (mean 9.6 % retention for control and buffer). Grass–wetland buffers retained 83 % and 85 % of cis- and trans-permethrin masses, respectively, while the control only retained 39 % and 44 % of cis- and trans-permethrin masses, respectively. Half-distances (the distance required to decrease pesticide concentration by one-half) for both permethrin isomers were 26 %–30 % shorter in grass buffers (22–23 m) than in the control (32 m). The current study demonstrates treatment efficacy was a function of pesticide properties with the more strongly sorbing permethrin retained to a greater degree. The study also demonstrates challenges in remediating multiple pesticides with a single management practice. By using suites of management practices, especially those employing vegetation, better mitigation of pesticide impacts may be accomplished.",93,5,574,579,Environmental chemistry; Pesticide; Vegetation; Pyrethroid; Permethrin; Diazinon; Toxicology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Wetland; Hydrology (agriculture),,"Agriculture; Biodegradation, Environmental; Diazinon/isolation & purification; Half-Life; Permethrin/isolation & purification; Poaceae/metabolism; Water Pollutants, Chemical/isolation & purification; Wetlands","Water Pollutants, Chemical; Permethrin; Diazinon",,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25145638 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/62056 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00128-014-1357-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-014-1357-8,25145638,10.1007/s00128-014-1357-8,1970728635,,0,002-650-706-842-54X; 005-036-416-261-092; 007-813-795-246-840; 008-008-047-908-516; 012-982-138-387-721; 016-084-115-518-996; 018-860-085-768-59X; 019-057-578-554-139; 019-441-740-247-409; 019-681-556-926-447; 026-148-929-344-676; 026-380-587-288-286; 028-458-024-589-093; 034-678-503-527-14X; 038-029-852-973-098; 042-068-205-134-729; 062-164-086-141-605; 064-675-402-941-338; 077-265-856-061-247; 086-496-072-727-834; 090-693-598-926-384; 097-986-438-425-365; 101-139-719-491-970; 103-588-191-891-891; 110-077-789-733-299; 111-288-588-656-115; 114-040-630-292-408; 166-604-449-988-782,9

An understanding of how farming practices in adjacent fields and the dimensions of the hedge and other components of the boundary affect birds is essential for efficient conservation management of field boundaries. This paper is based upon surveys of field boundary transects at two sites in eastern England. 2. The first study, near Huntingdon (1983-85), was based upon a range of field boundaries, from small ditches to tall hedges. The boundaries were between small pasture, small arable or large arable fields. 3. The second study, at Swavesey (1985-87), covered the various permutations of boundary structure, and adjacent cropping, available within a catchment of a tributary of the River Great Ouse. This study also included a range of drainage regimes. 4. Regression models were used to relate measures of bird species richness, in both winter and summer over several years, to field boundary attributes, including adjacent land use. 5. Bird variables were positively correlated with the physical size of the hedge, the number and height of trees and adjacent permanent pasture. These attributes accounted for most of the observed variation in bird variables. Ditch and verge dimensions played a statistically significant but relatively less important role. 6.

Leib; Cristoti A. Redulla; R. G. Stevens; G. R. Matthews; D. A. Strausz,"In the Lower Yakima River Basin of Washington, surface irrigators need to reduce sediment loads exiting their; fields in order to comply with newly established water quality standards. The goal of this research was to assess methods for; improving the water quality of return flow from furrow irrigation by combining a patch application of polyacrylamide (PAM); with an additional erosion control practice in the tailwater ditch. A study was conducted in 2001 and 2002 that combined; PAM with: 1) surge irrigation, 2) grass filter strips, 3) check dams, and 4) surface drains. In order to test the treatments under; different cultural practices and slopes, the study was conducted at three site: two vineyards with silt loam soils at 1.2% slope; in both the furrows and the tailwater ditch, and a cornfield with silt loam and sandy loam soil at 0.2% slope in both the furrows; and the tailwater ditch. During irrigation events, sediment samples were taken and outflow rates were recorded at periodic; intervals to determine sediment concentration, run-off volume, and sediment load from each treatment. At all sites and at all; monitored irrigations, the control plot, which had only the patch application of PAM, produced sediment concentrations; greater than the total maximum daily load standard of 56 mg.L-1 for the Lower Yakima River. All four erosion control; practices in combination with PAM were more effective in reducing sediment load at the vineyards as compared to the; cornfield. Only the grass treatment with PAM was consistent in reducing sediment concentrations below 56 mg.L-1 in both; the vineyards and the cornfield.",21,4,595,603,Loam; Tailwater; Check dam; Ditch; Return flow; Erosion control; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface irrigation,,,,,https://elibrary.asabe.org/abstract.asp??JID=3&AID=18567 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=1266231,http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/2013.18567,,10.13031/2013.18567,2060980685,,0,,17

Many herbivorous species are crop pests, while predatory insects have the potential to act as biological controls against pests. Overall insect diversity has declined as a result of intensified agricultural practices. Riparian buffers may support insect populations in intensively cultivated areas, but their actual impact on the balance between harmful pests and beneficial predators is not known. It can be postulated that this impact may vary depending on the characteristics and location of the riparian buffer itself. We investigated the possibility that the biotic and abiotic attributes of agricultural riparian buffers adjoining crop fields and watercourses can explain the species composition of hemipteran assemblages. In particular, we were interested in the abundances of species belonging to the genus Nabis (generalist predators) and recognized and potential pests of cereal crops. Riparian buffer width and the presence or absence of woody plants were not associated with hemipteran species turnover among riparian buffers. In contrast, differences in the degree of dominance by grasses, in plant species turnover, and in which crop plant was cultivated in the adjacent field, explained a significant proportion of the variance in hemipteran species turnover. The abundance of predatory Nabis species increased with increasing riparian buffer width, whereas the abundance of recognized and potential crop pests decreased. The reverse patterns in the predatory and herbivorous Heteroptera suggest that increasing riparian buffer width might enhance biological control by Nabis predators.",139,7,539,552,Riparian zone; Biodiversity; Abiotic component; Predation; Ecology; Riparian buffer; Generalist and specialist species; Herbivore; Agronomy; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,Academy of Finland; Alfred Kordelinin Säätiö,https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jen.12166 http://jukuri.luke.fi/handle/10024/485162,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jen.12166,,10.1111/jen.12166,2027841811,,0,006-476-271-169-687; 010-640-663-195-282; 013-473-732-004-51X; 014-648-561-664-967; 015-905-951-111-509; 016-421-756-148-512; 018-183-914-264-896; 020-831-252-589-740; 022-533-692-229-72X; 025-443-063-345-314; 027-116-596-605-531; 029-386-831-957-40X; 030-285-119-895-818; 030-766-878-238-058; 032-277-157-507-794; 034-656-684-601-494; 034-918-544-940-977; 036-245-909-592-258; 039-112-596-230-618; 040-449-873-182-757; 043-717-872-951-304; 044-629-783-838-349; 048-773-876-623-381; 049-346-208-924-920; 052-363-993-930-092; 055-055-819-201-710; 056-355-062-016-724; 056-789-845-462-569; 056-892-630-404-500; 059-502-614-601-929; 062-036-445-726-722; 063-465-479-536-275; 066-292-210-522-512; 067-278-208-817-958; 070-194-102-378-889; 074-721-711-958-181; 079-938-300-794-257; 080-139-567-968-521; 080-926-421-489-176; 087-779-919-702-867; 088-710-088-449-565; 089-820-647-773-411; 094-065-266-769-528; 095-091-186-927-456; 096-998-330-366-748; 098-939-648-476-800; 101-886-830-004-383; 103-800-435-940-553; 104-709-909-156-47X; 109-987-925-229-271; 115-162-803-612-505; 117-345-687-903-78X; 117-865-407-856-990; 121-954-134-376-260; 124-407-129-963-803; 124-771-585-809-587; 128-569-652-424-254; 154-386-144-197-99X; 166-167-543-032-020; 185-374-982-166-638,6

Noij; Marius Heinen; Hanneke I. M. Heesmans; Jac T. N. M. Thissen; Piet Groenendijk,"Unfertilized buffer strips (BS) are widely accepted to reduce nitrogen (N) loads from agricultural land to surface water. However, the relative reduction of N load or concentration (BS effectiveness, BSE), varies with management and local conditions, especially hydrogeology. We present novel experimental evidence on BSE for 5-m-wide grass BS on intensively drained and managed plain agricultural lowland with varying hydrogeology. We selected characteristic sites for five major hydrogeological classes of the Netherlands and installed paired 5-m-wide unfertilized grass (BS) and reference (REF) treatments along the ditch. The REF was managed like the adjacent field, and BS was only harvested. Treatments were equipped with reservoirs in the ditch to collect and measure discharge and flow proportional N concentration for 3 or 4 yr. In addition, N concentration in upper groundwater was measured. We found a statistically significant BSE of 10% on the peat site. At the other sites, BSE for N was low and statistically insignificant. Low BSE was explained by denitrification between adjacent field and ditch, as well as by the site-specific hydrologic factors including low proportion of shallow groundwater flow, downward seepage, low residence time in the BS, and surface runoff away from the ditch. We emphasize that a REF treatment is needed to evaluate BSE in agriculture and recommend reservoirs if drainage patterns are unknown. Introduction of a 5-m-wide BS is ineffective for mitigating N loads from lowland agriculture to surface waters. We expect more from BS specifically designed to abate surface runoff.",41,2,322,333,Groundwater flow; Ditch; Hydrology; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Peat; Denitrification; Groundwater; Surface water,,Agriculture/methods; Conservation of Natural Resources/methods; Nitrogen/analysis; Poaceae; Water/chemistry,Water; Nitrogen,"Dutch Ministry of Economy, Agriculture and Innovation; Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment",https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/articles/41/2/322 http://edepot.wur.nl/191383 http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/416920 https://edepot.wur.nl/191383 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Alibrary.wur.nl%3Awurpubs%2F416920 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22370394 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2134/jeq2010.0545 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2134/jeq2010.0545 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22370394,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2010.0545,22370394,10.2134/jeq2010.0545,2154095890,,0,002-144-120-393-650; 002-916-363-298-786; 008-467-759-539-985; 009-248-758-733-184; 009-911-694-040-108; 010-605-301-765-58X; 010-815-347-288-18X; 015-385-795-850-37X; 019-293-917-776-188; 022-561-650-298-223; 027-089-714-082-495; 032-178-061-523-825; 033-418-655-488-357; 035-333-104-712-949; 036-177-171-687-91X; 036-180-871-084-631; 040-198-568-662-726; 044-948-727-495-773; 051-607-714-466-701; 055-290-465-789-317; 058-305-580-152-790; 065-155-302-631-794; 066-008-497-105-394; 068-991-112-456-561; 070-686-985-257-87X; 070-955-276-847-909; 072-270-293-804-645; 072-750-761-923-411; 076-551-861-300-215; 076-648-465-506-220; 082-098-218-310-849; 083-692-916-137-156; 092-699-730-760-490; 097-856-436-465-210; 100-845-850-323-114; 104-230-077-662-702; 104-494-518-145-022; 121-468-243-703-60X; 130-940-780-158-38X; 132-703-534-988-824; 142-981-849-869-363; 159-694-679-272-93X; 168-228-690-607-508; 186-231-509-533-744; 193-665-714-529-631,19

Davis; Stephen M. Griffith; William R. Horwath; Jeffrey J. Steiner; David D. Myrold,"Riparian ecosystems, through their unique position in the agricultural landscape and ability to influence nutrient cycles, can potentially reduce NO3 loading to surface and ground waters. The purpose of this study was to determine the fate of NO3 in shallow groundwater moving along a lateral flowpath from a grass seed cropping system through an undisturbed mixed-species herbaceous riparian area. Soil A (30-45 cm) and C horizon (135-150 cm) NO3, dissolved oxygen, and nitrous oxide concentrations were significantly higher in the cropping system than the adjacent riparian area. Nitrate concentrations in both horizons of the riparian soil were consistently at or below 0.05 mg N L(-1) while cropping system concentrations ranged from 1 to 12 mg N L(-1). Chloride data suggested that NO3 dilution occurred from recharge by precipitation. However, a sharp decrease in NO3/Cl ratios as water moved into the riparian area indicated that additional dilution of NO3 concentrations was unlikely. Riparian area A horizon soil water had higher dissolved organic carbon than the cropping system and when the riparian soil became saturated, available electron acceptors (O2, NO3) were rapidly reduced. Dissolved inorganic carbon was significantly higher in the riparian area than the cropping system for both horizons indicating high biological activity. Carbon limitation in the cropping system may have led to microbial respiration using primarily O2 and to a lesser degree NO3.

However, the experimental evidence on their effectiveness (BSE) has been from sloping locations with shallow flow and surface runoff. The aim of this experimental study was to quantify BSE for P on flat agricultural lowland, predominantly with deep flow. We selected sites characteristic of five major hydrogeological classes in the Netherlands and in each experimental field installed paired 5-m-wide unfertilized grass (BS) and reference treatments (REF) that abutted the ditch. The REF treatments were managed similar to the adjacent grass or maize field, but BS treatments were only harvested. Each treatment had a reservoir in the ditch to collect and measure discharge and flowproportional P concentration for 3 or 4 yr. We also measured net P withdrawal, the P status of the soil and P concentration in upper groundwater. We found a significant BSE for P of 61% on the site with the shallowest flow and steepest slope (2%). At the other sites, BSE was low and statistically insignificant. We conclude that harvested unfertilized buffer strips reduce P loads from flat fields only in specific areas with high surface runoff and ⁄ or shallow flow, especially in combination with a high original soil P status.",29,,162,174,Ditch; Fertilizer; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Phosphorus; Groundwater; Surface water,,,,,https://baeredygtigtlandbrug.dk/media/187182/hollandsk-randzoneforsoeg.pdf http://core.ac.uk/display/29220099 http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/439249 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1475-2743.2012.00443.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-2743.2012.00443.x,,10.1111/j.1475-2743.2012.00443.x,1493096678,,0,004-542-673-682-563; 021-263-614-020-476; 022-561-650-298-223; 023-617-088-267-054; 031-476-765-490-944; 036-180-871-084-631; 044-948-727-495-773; 047-470-673-142-233; 049-428-818-490-786; 050-192-580-951-948; 065-155-302-631-794; 066-008-497-105-394; 070-686-985-257-87X; 074-708-701-760-132; 081-797-255-967-635; 085-054-907-981-634; 097-856-436-465-210; 119-537-209-793-749; 121-468-243-703-60X; 132-703-534-988-824; 148-468-520-956-729; 159-694-679-272-93X; 167-652-578-388-575; 186-915-764-682-509,11

Two rectangular enclosures were installed over a succession of habitats with a decreasing prey availability: a hedge, a mixed crop strip and an adjacent crop culture. Marked starved and satiated individuals were released in the enclosures and recaptured during 8 days. Initial satiation state had a significant effect on activity. Also, the initial displacements of beetles depended both on the habitat and on the initial satiation state. P. melanarius appeared to have flexible habitat-use, depending mainly on three factors: the satiation state, the habitat preference of the species, and the prey availability in the habitat.",89,3,253,259,Biological pest control; Integrated pest management; Ecological succession; Foraging; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Crop (anatomy); Mark and recapture; Biology,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016788090100216X http://www.cbtm-moulis.com/fichiers_site/a2992ctm/contenu_pages/fournier_loreau_agric_ecosyst_environ_2002.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016788090100216X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-8809(01)00216-x,,10.1016/s0167-8809(01)00216-x,2133953481,,0,019-957-290-510-077; 020-837-897-719-052; 023-851-975-669-59X; 026-969-752-606-914; 029-986-346-215-671; 030-966-936-658-509; 047-468-655-755-164; 053-830-117-088-153; 068-404-335-294-29X; 076-355-879-729-476; 078-272-079-532-367; 080-139-567-968-521; 084-387-070-806-39X; 087-286-707-662-159; 110-684-291-574-379; 112-148-110-351-322; 128-109-919-761-712; 132-569-724-005-273; 134-797-888-874-528; 140-484-169-852-410; 180-433-921-201-722; 189-086-207-766-711,33

Anderson; Ranjith P. Udawatta; Tshepiso Seobi; Harold E. Garrett,"Agroforestry practices are receiving increased attention in temperate zones due to their environmental and economic benefits. To test the hypothesis that agroforestry buffers reduce runoff by increased infiltration, water use, and water storage; profile water content and soil water infiltration were measured for a Putnam soil (fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Albaqualf). The watershed was under no-till management with a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation since 1991. Agroforestry buffer strips, 4.5 m wide and 36.5 m apart, were planted with redtop (Agrostis gigantea Roth), brome (Bromus spp.), and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.). Pin oak (Quercus palustris Muenchh.), swamp white oak (Q. bicolor Willd.) and bur oak (Q. macrocarpa Michx.) trees were planted at 3-m intervals in the center of the agroforestry buffers in 1997. Ponded water infiltration was measured in agroforestry and grass buffers and row crop areas. Water content in agroforestry and row crop areas at 5, 10, 20, and 40 cm depths were measured throughout the year. Quasi-steady infiltration rates were not different (P > 0.05) among the treatments. Agroforestry had lower soil water content than row crop areas (P < 0.05) during the growing season. Higher water content after the principal recharge event in the agroforestry treatment was attributed to better infiltration through the root system. Results show that agroforestry buffer strips reduce soil water content during critical times such as fallow periods, and increase water infiltration and water storage. Therefore, adoption of agroforestry buffer practices may reduce runoff and soil loss from watersheds in row crop management.",75,1,5,16,Infiltration (hydrology); Water use; Soil classification; Soil water; Water content; Bur Oak; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Agroforestry; Agronomy,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-008-9128-3 http://www.cinram.umn.edu/sites/cinram.umn.edu/files/udawatta-soilwater.pdf https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093035593,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-008-9128-3,,10.1007/s10457-008-9128-3,2098566028,,0,000-138-906-927-729; 002-430-400-638-330; 003-232-594-172-08X; 003-728-899-949-75X; 005-489-558-984-378; 005-742-835-423-082; 010-444-920-504-739; 011-481-629-990-195; 017-164-188-141-313; 018-885-734-779-223; 019-622-915-734-27X; 021-772-319-606-63X; 029-063-620-353-079; 029-386-528-575-804; 031-747-316-283-79X; 031-827-932-510-159; 036-466-585-417-013; 037-513-929-028-173; 038-439-180-047-201; 039-563-348-061-272; 040-292-160-017-257; 045-348-219-847-047; 054-619-304-992-861; 056-367-934-468-09X; 057-131-240-501-938; 062-143-711-138-127; 062-573-990-568-532; 064-239-686-824-334; 064-541-994-321-015; 068-894-738-846-815; 070-377-273-331-446; 070-581-741-328-503; 072-164-353-760-56X; 072-296-667-465-701; 073-295-711-323-455; 076-826-572-086-275; 084-692-472-527-650; 088-017-310-971-747; 090-146-229-314-179; 092-151-860-414-648; 095-341-098-849-127; 098-849-871-898-660; 108-938-515-566-470; 111-288-588-656-115; 123-334-480-318-27X; 129-248-686-843-501; 130-451-837-086-456; 140-621-286-192-86X; 142-912-781-466-437; 151-801-588-352-010; 152-588-862-912-313; 165-388-551-938-802; 176-609-806-702-013; 178-431-280-312-340; 187-916-991-523-04X,100

Smiley; Kevin W. King; Norman R. Fausey,"a b s t r a c t Herbaceous riparian buffers (CP 21 grass filter strips) are a widely used agricultural conservation practice in the United States for reducing nutrient, pesticide, and sediment loadings to agricultural streams. The ecological impacts of herbaceous riparian buffers on the channelized agricultural headwater streams that are common throughout the midwestern United States have not been evaluated. We sampled riparian habitat, geomorphology, instream habitat, water chemistry, fishes, and amphibians for 4 years from three channelized agricultural headwater streams without herbaceous riparian buffers and three channelized streams with herbaceous riparian buffers in central Ohio. Only seven of 55 response variables exhibited differences between buffer types. Riparian widths were greater in channelized headwater streams with herbaceous riparian buffers than streams without herbaceous riparian buffers. Percent insectivores and minnows were greater in channelized streams without herbaceous riparian buffers than streams with herbaceous riparian buffers. Percent clay, turbidity, specific conductance, and pH differed between buffer types only during one sampling period. No differences in geomorphology and amphibian communities occurred between buffer types. Our results suggest channelized agricultural headwater streams with and without herbaceous riparian buffers are similar physically, chemically, and biologically. Installation of herbaceous riparian buffers alone adjacent to channelized agricultural headwater streams in central Ohio and other parts of the midwestern United States may only provide limited environmental benefits for these stream ecosystems in the first 4–6 years after establishment. Alternative implementation designs combining the use of herbaceous riparian buffers with other practices capable of altering nutrient and pesticide loads, riparian hydrology, and instream habitat are needed.

Conover; Stephen J. Dinsmore; L. Wes Burger,"Creating and restoring patches of noncrop early-succession vegetation within agricultural landscapes may mitigate grassland bird population declines caused by agricultural land use and intensification. Achieving this goal requires an ability to balance avian benefits with agronomics, which may be facilitated by understanding how bird communities respond to various conservation practices. We evaluated bird richness, abundance, Shannon diversity, and Total Avian Conservation Value in 20 replicates of four Conservation Reserve Program practices in an intensive rowcrop agricultural landscape in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley from May–Jul., 2005–2007. Conservation practices included: (1) large blocks of structurally-diverse early-succession vegetation (6–8 y old trees) and three buffer types; (2) 30 m wide monotypic filter strips with tall dense switchgrass (Panicum virgatum); (3) 30 m wide diverse filter strips with a forb-native warm season grass mixture; and (4) 60 m wide early-succession riparian forest buffers (1–3 y old trees). The breeding bird community was dominated by red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus; 43% of total) and dickcissels (Spiza americana; 42% of total) but commonly included eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea), mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). We observed ≥1.8 × more dickcissels in large blocks and diverse filter strips than other buffers and greater Shannon diversity in large blocks than any buffers (P < 0.05). Diverse filter strips had ≥1.6 × greater overall bird density (7.2 birds/0.6 ha), on average, than all other practices. Based on these data, we conclude that buffers are attractive to farmland breeding birds and may provide important ecological benefits to supplement a conservation management system founded on large blocks of early-succession vegetation.",172,1,61,75,Riparian forest; Conservation Reserve Program; Vegetation; Ecology; Geography; Agelaius; Panicum virgatum; Set-aside; Population; Species richness; Agroforestry,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/38936467 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/nrem_pubs/132/ https://works.bepress.com/stephen_dinsmore/71/ https://bioone.org/journals/the-american-midland-naturalist/volume-172/issue-1/0003-0031-172.1.61/Effects-of-Set-aside-Conservation-Practices-on-Bird-Community-Structure/10.1674/0003-0031-172.1.61.pdf https://www.gri.msstate.edu/publications/docs/2014/02/12568Conover_et_al__2014.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ross_Conover/publication/264416995_Effects_of_Set-aside_Conservation_Practices_on_Bird_Community_Structure_within_an_Intensive_Agricultural_Landscape/links/53dbf2790cf216e4210c0437.pdf https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1132&context=nrem_pubs http://www.erc.msstate.edu/publications/docs/2014/02/12568Conover_et_al__2014.pdf https://bioone.org/journals/the-american-midland-naturalist/volume-172/issue-1/0003-0031-172.1.61/Effects-of-Set-aside-Conservation-Practices-on-Bird-Community-Structure/10.1674/0003-0031-172.1.61.full https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/1247701 https://core.ac.uk/download/38936467.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031-172.1.61,,10.1674/0003-0031-172.1.61,2116269780,,0,000-006-765-483-604; 000-281-554-875-962; 000-587-003-041-373; 001-714-225-412-729; 003-510-625-031-181; 006-160-602-569-108; 007-345-255-242-473; 007-416-181-403-689; 011-287-863-694-168; 012-786-800-731-307; 015-373-969-372-614; 017-298-227-855-778; 020-808-060-559-98X; 024-603-870-603-934; 024-930-458-999-226; 027-356-962-068-696; 029-067-159-542-004; 029-966-525-517-693; 031-592-787-048-258; 031-938-563-126-363; 033-989-874-629-980; 034-379-611-675-940; 038-390-191-870-442; 039-800-551-937-475; 044-307-871-990-779; 047-000-620-546-182; 049-268-547-921-07X; 051-865-427-302-095; 056-789-845-462-569; 064-524-534-627-895; 068-811-888-710-634; 079-261-909-912-581; 083-817-276-818-506; 084-250-234-469-178; 089-432-459-576-010; 093-959-883-434-80X; 094-080-626-106-361; 095-014-169-963-827; 102-623-180-647-37X; 111-685-276-532-817; 115-123-313-615-824; 117-345-687-903-78X; 118-607-171-279-166; 124-362-582-173-520; 125-512-608-629-475; 128-222-836-109-002; 132-380-117-709-640; 133-025-020-758-454; 133-199-519-838-349; 135-665-245-647-307; 143-454-151-968-118; 162-932-673-062-383; 167-634-641-169-828; 169-398-551-622-968; 173-117-656-524-396; 183-033-307-001-620; 195-618-519-387-640,7

Sorenson; J. R. Bradley,"The influence, if any, of 5m wide, feral, herbaceous field borders on pest and beneficial arthropods in commercial cotton, Gossypium hirsutum (L.) (Malvales: Malvaceae), fields was measured through a variety of sampling techniques over three years. In each year, 5 fields with managed, feral vegetation borders and five fields without such borders were examined. Sampling was stratified from the field border or edge in each field in an attempt to elucidate any edge effects that might have occurred. Early season thrips populations appeared to be unaffected by the presence of a border. Pitfall sampling disclosed no differences in ground-dwelling predaceous arthropods but did detect increased populations of crickets around fields with borders. Cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii Glover) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) populations were too low during the study to adequately assess border effects. Heliothines, Heliothis virescens (F.) and Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), egg numbers and damage rates were largely unaffected by the presence or absence of a border, although in one instance egg numbers were significantly lower in fields with borders. Overall, foliage-dwelling predaceous arthropods were somewhat more abundant in fields with borders than in fields without borders. Tarnished plant bugs, Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois) (Heteroptera: Miridae) were significantly more abundant in fields with borders, but stink bugs, Acrosternum hilare (Say), and Euschistus servus (Say) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) numbers appeared to be largely unaffected by border treatment. Few taxa clearly exhibited distributional edge effects relative to the presence or absence of border vegetation.

The results showed that hedgerows and woodlands with bushes and coppice are key foraging habitats. They also highlight the importance of the presence of a network of wooded elements connecting the maternity roost with the foraging areas. To assure long-term protection of this colony, strong habitat conservation measures should be taken in a radius of up to 1-2 km around the roost.",132,1,49,54,Foraging; Endangered species; Habitat; Ecology; Woodland; Bat detector; Horseshoe bat; Rhinolophus hipposideros; Habitat conservation; Biology,,,,,https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/111778 https://orbi.ulg.ac.be/bitstream/2268/111778/1/Rh%20hippo%20conservation.pdf http://centrostudinatura.it/public2/documenti/478-81135.pdf,https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/111778,,,2125724639,,0,008-345-865-998-784; 011-863-428-551-368; 021-408-404-134-285; 030-574-164-676-834; 044-509-591-427-311; 063-190-107-767-195; 064-944-144-468-13X; 138-885-880-273-002,19

Differences in the parameters studied were significant between filter and no filter strips, regardless of filter strip width. Two days after treatment, metribuzin concentration in runoff from the unfiltered treatment was 231 ng ml-'; filter strips reduced this amount to 119 ng ml-' or less. Similar trends were observed with metolachlor, with concentrations of 1,009 ng ml-' from the unfiltered, whereas filter strips of any width reduced this to 523 ng ml-' or less. Metribuzin loss during the growing season was 41 g ai ha-', or 9.8% of the amount applied when no filter strip was present. The addition of a filter strip, regardless of width, reduced cumulative metribuzin losses to 11 g ha-I or less. Similar results were noted with metolachlor.

Macdonald; Fiona Mathews,"Linear habitats are becoming increasingly common as a consequence of habitat fragmentation, and may provide the sole habitat for some species. Hedgerows are linear features that can vary substantially in structure and quality. Having surveyed 180 hedgerows, in four locations, and sampled their small mammal communities we examined the effect of physical hedgerow attributes on the abundance of small mammal species. Using three elements of landscape structure, we explored whether variation was best explained by the Random Sample Hypothesis (that small islands represent a random sample of those species populating larger areas), or by the Fragmentation Hypothesis (that species abundance will decrease with a loss of habitat area). We tested the relationship between the relative abundance of small mammals and 1. hedgerow connectivity; 2. total habitat availability and 3. local habitat complexity. We then explored the predictive power of combinations of these habitat variables. Connectivity was a positive predictor of wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus, and hedgerow gappiness was a negative predictor of bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus. The total amount of habitat available (hedgerow width, height and length) was a positive indicator of total small mammal biomass. These results support the Fragmentation Hypothesis that species abundance and distribution decrease with a loss of habitat area. The preservation of linear and associated habitats may therefore be important in maintaining metapopulations of the species we studied.",22,7,1019,1032,Biomass (ecology); Relative species abundance; Habitat fragmentation; Habitat; Ecology; Metapopulation; Wildlife corridor; Abundance (ecology); Biology; Landscape ecology,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-007-9088-4 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/4398610 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fiona_Mathews/publication/225696642_Are_hedgerows_the_route_to_increased_farmland_small_mammal_density_Use_of_hedgerows_in_British_pastoral_habitats/links/0912f50d05e428959a000000.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10980-007-9088-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-007-9088-4,,10.1007/s10980-007-9088-4,2000738661,,0,002-234-862-186-238; 002-481-178-498-479; 005-608-429-136-435; 011-321-509-203-051; 013-242-441-405-876; 014-311-157-701-734; 023-554-522-298-713; 027-476-225-601-16X; 033-472-727-409-564; 035-051-432-999-701; 037-138-831-910-49X; 038-618-402-954-434; 039-035-517-623-370; 041-412-958-194-244; 046-706-622-716-331; 049-797-143-512-935; 055-107-013-670-19X; 058-159-233-872-010; 061-439-681-885-75X; 071-601-656-233-384; 071-604-253-914-381; 073-335-262-644-942; 073-798-803-161-275; 074-584-699-614-045; 075-182-328-430-399; 088-470-568-990-908; 094-650-742-773-622; 095-877-317-702-391; 097-854-286-595-124; 132-898-566-034-905; 144-463-043-294-25X; 147-490-702-686-71X; 158-310-130-207-979; 162-900-077-924-892; 164-187-601-168-344; 169-297-520-424-667; 172-657-788-299-89X,72

Only farmers with game and conservation interests claimed to adopt field-boundary management that would benefit Whitethroats, but across all farms, intended and actual herbaceous strips were too narrow, and their management too imprecise, for Whitethroats and other wildlife.

Shaw; Michele Boyette,"Abstract Field studies were conducted in 1996, 1997, and 1998 to determine the effectiveness of several grasses as filter strips for reducing sediment and herbicide losses in runoff. Big bluestem, eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, and tall fescue reduced total runoff volume by at least 55, 76, 49, and 46%, respectively. Within the 127-d sampling period, each perennial grass filter strip investigated reduced total sediment loss in surface runoff by at least 66%.

Sovell; Bruce Vondracek; Julia A. Frost; Karen G. Mumford,"We assessed the relationship between riparian management and stream quality along five southeastern Minnesota streams in 1995 and 1996. Specifically, we examined the effect of rotationally and continuously grazed pastures and different types of riparian buffer strips on water chemistry, physical habitat, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish as indicators of stream quality. We collected data at 17 sites under different combinations of grazing and riparian management, using a longitudinal design on three streams and a paired watershed design on two others. Continuous and rotational grazing were compared along one longitudinal study stream and at the paired watershed. Riparian buffer management, fenced trees (wood buffer), fenced grass, and unfenced rotationally grazed areas were the focus along the two remaining longitudinal streams. Principal components analysis (PCA) of water chemistry, physical habitat, and biotic data indicated a local management effect. The ordinations separated continuous grazing from sites with rotational grazing and sites with wood buffers from those with grass buffers or rotationally grazed areas. Fecal coliform and turbidity were consistently higher at continuously grazed than rotationally grazed sites. Percent fines in the streambed were significantly higher at sites with wood buffers than grass and rotationally grazed areas, and canopy cover was similar at sites with wood and grass buffers. Benthic macroinvertebrate metrics were significant but were not consistent across grazing and riparian buffer management types. Fish density and abundance were related to riparian buffer type, rather than grazing practices. Our study has potentially important implications for stream restoration programs in the midwestern United States. Our comparisons suggest further consideration and study of a combination of grass and wood riparian buffer strips as midwestern stream management options, rather than universally installing wood buffers in every instance.

Roberts; Paul T.W. Rosier; David J. Gowing,"Gross rainfall (PG), net rainfall and stemflow were measured for nearly 3 years in two hedgerows in southern England. The width of the zone where net rainfall was affected by the hedgerows was equivalent to about two hedgerow heights. Rainfall interception was calculated as the difference between the volume of water, from gross rainfall, that would have reached the ground of the sampling area (which also included areas outside the canopy) without the presence of a hedgerow and the actual amount of net rainfall plus stemflow. Averaged over both hedgerows the interception loss during the period of full leaf cover was 57% of PG if related to the ground area covered by the hedgerow canopies or 24% of PG if related to the total ground area affected by the presence of the hedgerows. For the leafless period, the respective values were 49 and 19%. Stemflow constituted a small part in the water balance of the hedgerows and equalled 0.2% of PG in the summer and 0.5% of PG in the winter. Interception storage capacity, if related to projected canopy area, was 2.6 mm during the growing season and 1.2 mm in the leafless hedgerows. During many small rainstorms, which were often associated with high windspeeds, the hedgerows intercepted more rainwater than the amount that would have fallen on the ground covered by them without their presence. This caused the coefficient of free throughfall, when calculated per unit projected canopy area, to be negative. The original Gash [Gash, J.H.C., 1979. An analytical model of rainfall interception by forests. Quart. J. R. Meteorol. Soc. 105, 43–55] analytical model of rainfall interception was parameterised for the hedgerows and tested using data that had not been included in the parameterisation process. The Gash model predicted the interception loss of hedgerows from daily rainfall data with reasonable accuracy",141,2-4,244,256,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2006.10.012,,10.1016/j.agrformet.2006.10.012,,,0,000-385-686-505-898; 015-223-217-000-275; 019-392-812-453-896; 019-955-611-468-318; 024-397-401-767-800; 027-508-322-472-615; 031-701-170-338-669; 031-874-654-065-500; 040-324-883-066-187; 042-660-969-184-235; 047-949-455-932-004; 051-703-524-010-535; 052-599-960-412-708; 069-817-771-418-457; 076-132-372-639-537; 078-084-121-881-280; 084-483-831-709-149; 086-628-818-920-553; 095-262-261-152-659; 107-791-704-689-461; 122-485-027-252-358; 125-564-609-352-214; 127-393-635-700-381; 129-626-313-859-266; 130-109-751-983-048; 132-725-106-208-833; 134-598-232-626-634; 143-675-330-135-030; 147-835-255-816-092; 151-132-653-467-645; 151-874-864-905-759; 151-923-803-853-551; 153-427-856-924-405; 183-366-099-166-134; 191-797-833-235-531; 197-854-782-764-519; 198-774-640-872-545,34

Smiley; Jonathan D. Maul; Charles M. Cooper,"Abstract Riparian zones and agricultural fields adjacent to incised streams in northwestern Mississippi are impacted by gully erosion initiated by runoff flowing over unstable streambanks. Currently, installation of erosion control structures (drop pipes) at the riparian zone—agricultural field interface halts gully erosion and simultaneously establishes one of four riparian habitat types. Avian communities were compared among four types of restored habitats and among four seasonal periods in northwestern Mississippi from June 1994 to May 1996. Fifty-seven species were observed among riparian habitats, of which 49% were neotropical migrants. Habitat type and season significantly affected species richness, abundance, and diversity. Species richness, abundance, and diversity increased as habitat area, pool volume, and vertical structure of woody vegetation increased among riparian habitat types. Additionally, species richness, abundance, and diversity increased during spring and fall. The influence of habitat type on avian species richness, abundance, and diversity did not differ among seasons. Present drop pipe installation practices focus on erosion control without consideration of habitat creation. Installation practices can be altered to more effectively incorporate habitat creation to provide the greatest ecological benefits for avian communities within impacted riparian zones.",122,2,149,156,Riparian zone; Community structure; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Erosion control; STREAMS; Surface runoff; Species richness; Restoration ecology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880907000230,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2006.12.028,,10.1016/j.agee.2006.12.028,2142929496,,0,006-993-035-097-664; 015-373-969-372-614; 015-972-530-795-981; 018-398-977-970-251; 026-825-605-796-532; 047-000-620-546-182; 047-767-489-896-673; 059-008-276-434-748; 062-018-456-407-701; 066-308-155-157-535; 075-781-408-578-136; 085-372-195-731-912; 086-083-393-802-502; 094-504-188-201-508; 107-605-939-075-788; 119-209-557-350-650; 129-795-413-211-042; 133-652-315-317-982; 156-342-165-494-721; 159-096-015-460-479; 168-153-013-773-783; 170-230-483-322-002; 179-085-721-200-81X; 191-508-311-193-465,11

Debinski,"Summary; ; ; 1; The behaviour of two butterfly species, a habitat specialist (Speyeria idalia) and a habitat generalist (Danaus plexippus), was tracked at four prairie edges to determine the extent to which edges act as a barrier to emigration. The four edge types studied were crop, road, field and treeline. The edges differed in structure ranging from high-contrast (treeline) to low-contrast (field).; ; 2; S. idalia, the habitat specialist, responded strongly to all edges, even those with low structural contrast. However, S. idalia’s response was strongly affected by conspecific density at crop and field edges; individuals were less likely to exit from high density plots. S. idalia responded to edges both by turning to avoid crossing them, and returning to the plot if they had crossed.; ; 3; D. plexippus responded strongly only to treeline edges. Wind direction and time of year were important factors influencing behaviour at edges for this species. Conspecific density was not a significant factor affecting their behaviour. D. plexippus responded to edges by not crossing them, but rarely returned once they had crossed.; ; 4; In highly fragmented landscapes, such as the one in which this study occurred, butterflies which show little or no response to edges may exhibit high emigration rates because of the high probability of encountering an edge in small habitat patches. Butterflies may respond strongly to even subtle habitat boundaries, but those responses may be modified by the edge structure, local environment or other conditions. Therefore, modifying edge structure may be a way to influence emigration rates, making it a useful tool for conservation.",70,5,840,852,Habitat fragmentation; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Regal fritillary; Danaus; Butterfly; Speyeria; Nymphalidae; Generalist and specialist species,,,,,https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.0021-8790.2001.00546.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.0021-8790.2001.00546.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.0021-8790.2001.00546.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.0021-8790.2001.00546.x/full https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.0021-8790.2001.00546.x/full?scrollTo=references,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0021-8790.2001.00546.x,,10.1046/j.0021-8790.2001.00546.x,1535841963,,0,000-271-857-070-759; 007-351-842-611-246; 009-812-617-939-431; 015-218-134-012-477; 022-053-523-518-499; 022-440-670-281-663; 025-541-387-485-048; 035-010-410-713-572; 037-060-768-711-537; 038-591-972-424-171; 043-930-938-740-351; 049-672-924-935-368; 057-490-943-271-475; 057-524-883-211-51X; 058-039-935-485-908; 067-277-473-537-389; 077-518-596-975-597; 078-517-244-526-52X; 081-999-833-456-550; 087-226-670-725-181; 095-104-916-898-838; 095-219-668-939-329; 095-522-959-685-498; 095-730-453-974-686; 102-078-797-361-055; 104-509-449-072-200; 109-335-442-828-436; 110-055-869-277-580; 145-112-646-303-735; 146-977-228-707-912; 149-107-018-154-280; 153-573-077-211-153; 159-992-062-101-765; 183-353-234-599-811; 190-059-152-207-526; 198-555-686-356-757,227

An opportunity for innovation is offered by the growing success of chip-fed boilers, since the production of chips is simpler than that of logs and has a higher potential for cost reduction. Within this context, a study was conducted in Italy with the goals of: (a) designing three alternative chip harvesting methods for buffer strips, (b) field-testing the performance of each alternative, and (c) developing a model for estimating the cost of these methods under varying operational and economic conditions. The three harvesting methods reflected different mechanization levels, with escalating investment requirements. Overall, the study demonstrated that frequent maintenance of young, single row buffer strips generates profits only when thoroughly mechanized. Using a dedicated feller-buncher, a front-end loader for extraction and an industrial truck-mounted chipper brought the delivered cost below the 14 €/m3 loose chips (approximately 4 €/GJ) presently paid by the district heating stations. However, the intermediate-mechanization system showed the highest potential for improvements.

Ings; Will Manley,"Abstract Field margin plots, sown with either a simple grass mix, a complex grass mix with or without forbs or allowed to regenerate naturally were established around four fields on the Royal Agricultural College’s Harnhill farm in the west of England. Two of the fields were managed conventionally and two were managed organically. Plants and invertebrates were recorded on the margin plots over a 2 year period to test the influence of the different mixtures on the community assemblages. There was no difference in the seed bank of the different plot types, however the organically managed margins contained more unsown species than the conventionally managed margins. The simple mix plots had significantly fewer plant species than the other plots. The naturally regenerating plots had significantly lower grass cover and grass species diversity than the other plots. In the second year perennial grass and perennial forb cover increased in all mixtures. Both the cover and numbers of unsown species were reduced in the sown plots in the second year. Percentage cover and species richness of forbs were significantly higher in the complex grass with forbs and naturally regenerating plots. Auchenorrhyncha, Heteroptera and Araneae abundance were significantly correlated with plant species richness. Also, both plant species richness and total plant cover significantly influenced the Auchenorrhyncha community. Invertebrate abundance was greater in the organically managed plots than in the conventional ones, except larval Coleoptera. In the second year significantly more predatory Coleoptera species were trapped in the natural regeneration plots.

Morgan; J. Edward Gates,"Bird populations in Japanese multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) plantings and forest edge habitats adjacent to cultivated fields were examined. Bird species richness, abundance, and diversity were calculated for 6 management situations-forest edge, forest edge with a rose hedgerow, tall fescue waterway, rose hedgerow waterway, rose hedgerow with an unmowed tall fescue strip, and rose hedgerow with a mowed fescue strip. The hedgerow-forest edges had higher bird species richness, abundance, and diversity than the open forest edges. Differences between sites were greatest in winter and early spring. In late spring/summer, several mixed habitat or edge bird species were detected in the hedgerow-forest edges that were absent or seldom observed in the open forest edges. The addition of edge species was also responsible for the fall, winter, and early spring differences. Avian use of the tall fescue waterways was low in all seasons and much lower than the rose hedgerow waterways. Avian use of rose hedgerows with grass borders was not greatly affected by mowing the 7-9-m wide tall fescue border. Wintering birds concentrated in rose hedgerows apparently as a result of the lack of dense shrub cover in other habitats. J. WILDL.

Ludy; A. Lang,"Abstract Concerns have been raised that genetically modified Bt maize may harm non-target organisms, and there is a general call and need for a risk assessment of Bt maize. Spiders are important pest predators in agroecosystems and in maize, and can be exposed to the Bt toxin by herbivorous or pollen-collecting prey, by active Bt maize pollen feeding, and by ingesting their pollen-dusted webs. The foliage-dwelling spider fauna of Bt maize fields and adjacent margins was monitored and compared to non-transgenic maize fields. The study took place during the vegetation seasons of 2001–2003 in Bavaria, South Germany. Maize fields and adjacent nettle field margins were colonized by a typical spider assemblage, dominated by space-web spiders (Theridiidae and Linyphiidae). Abundance and species richness of spiders was higher in nettle margins than in maize fields. The proportion of hunting spiders tended to be higher in nettle margins, whereas space-web spiders tended to be more frequent in maize fields. Bt maize showed no consistent effect on individual numbers, species richness and guild structure of spiders in maize fields and adjacent nettle field margin strips. The spider abundance was higher in Bt treatments in 2003, whereas in 2001 and 2002 no significant differences were found. The results provide an important contribution for the implementation of case-specific and general surveillance of transgenic plants to be employed due to the regulations of the European Community.",38,3,314,324,Predation; Ecology; PEST analysis; Theridiidae; Linyphiidae; Spider; Herbivore; Species richness; Guild; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049964406001617 https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND43832167,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2006.05.010,,10.1016/j.biocontrol.2006.05.010,2100812812,,0,001-563-402-223-078; 004-563-023-073-419; 007-694-065-943-477; 008-309-802-131-720; 009-999-710-482-889; 012-357-805-545-268; 016-047-920-055-848; 017-940-835-738-976; 018-094-911-479-125; 018-573-577-914-221; 019-342-360-513-88X; 019-711-184-333-388; 020-082-792-983-196; 028-280-508-885-141; 028-817-390-372-005; 029-305-519-440-53X; 032-290-926-163-76X; 032-544-266-365-960; 033-322-808-294-208; 033-718-547-875-987; 048-636-936-576-804; 050-597-055-875-946; 050-749-698-945-338; 052-759-248-178-030; 056-995-316-009-838; 058-386-110-542-169; 060-201-639-645-254; 060-266-351-389-607; 060-391-113-919-919; 061-065-282-348-70X; 064-406-747-850-970; 064-856-641-171-767; 070-567-980-011-860; 070-703-492-655-943; 073-710-680-501-997; 073-797-947-467-295; 083-000-534-455-511; 086-419-085-554-996; 090-316-896-986-744; 092-132-204-004-778; 094-385-655-628-051; 098-555-162-345-55X; 109-133-869-515-118; 114-385-239-299-862; 118-409-347-010-789; 123-390-496-795-691; 124-401-261-113-85X; 132-566-485-988-343; 137-637-923-794-571; 141-452-852-502-431; 149-027-017-028-450; 149-454-732-753-762; 154-143-746-540-082; 157-004-358-576-445; 158-410-477-692-924; 162-206-053-615-649; 168-458-339-894-814,33

The study aims were to compare soil oribatid mite diversity at sites within agricultural land and to assess the role of different land components as potential diversity sources. An arable field was sampled weekly on 12 sampling occasions at five sites along a transect line from a drainage ditch with a willow tree belt (hedgerow at field margin) and across the field, which had a terrain depression without water outflow. A spring-time investigation period was chosen when the field depression and the drainage ditch would have been waterlogged. Oribatid abundances at the uncultivated willow hedgerow and the depression were significantly different, not only from the rest of field sites but also from each other. The euryvalent species Oppiella nova , Oppiella obsoleta and Tectocepheus velatus dominated in the arable soils beyond the depression. The community species spectrum at the bottom of the depression, which had considerably higher soil moisture was similar to other field sites but hygro- and halotolerant Oxyoppia europaea , Microppia minus prevailed in this community. Low competitive ability and wide tolerance to environmental changes is probably the reason for the distribution pattern of these species. In the hedgerow a different community was established, with the dominant species Dissorhina ornata , Ramusella insculpta and Hermaniella dolosa being abundant usually in forest and meadow habitats rich in organic matter. Distinct environmental conditions at this site (no cultivation, leaf litter layer on the soil surface) enabled a more diverse oribatid community to establish itself, which was comprised of more specialized (less tolerant) species. We observed a high turnover rate of accidental species in field sites and more stable communities in hedgerow and depression sites. The results document that even small landscape units may serve as important diversity sources (corridors) for restitution of local microarthropod communities in arable fields (α-diversity), provided that management practices avoid drastic changes leading to the disturbance and degradation of arable soils.",50,,97,105,Community structure; Floodplain; Soil water; Habitat; Ecology; Willow; Environmental science; Plant litter; Transect; Arable land,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1164556311001403 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1164556311001403,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2011.12.008,,10.1016/j.ejsobi.2011.12.008,1977787056,,0,000-926-058-767-220; 005-508-343-969-868; 020-766-049-601-136; 022-631-176-571-333; 024-841-804-252-519; 025-307-718-158-485; 026-117-130-875-060; 032-678-634-633-804; 046-134-886-900-385; 049-346-208-924-920; 051-012-131-501-111; 052-951-584-268-481; 055-931-322-921-824; 057-024-061-124-467; 060-997-589-015-33X; 068-605-066-391-163; 070-943-268-802-331; 079-518-122-392-480; 084-071-004-966-167; 085-593-237-988-046; 086-504-897-125-43X; 114-443-037-294-791; 121-959-034-158-146; 123-876-378-485-641; 124-864-994-652-376; 130-434-238-167-911; 135-055-655-791-637; 158-498-105-839-226; 164-038-293-892-058; 189-705-231-003-183; 194-102-381-028-720,15

Finn; Laura Kirwan; Daire Ó hUallacháin,"P>1. Increased intensification in agricultural grasslands has led to well-documented declines in the associated flora. Manipulation of field margins for biodiversity enhancement in arable systems has been extensively investigated. However, there is a paucity of corresponding long-term research within intensively managed grasslands. 2. We investigated a combination of establishment and management methods to enhance botanical diversity of newly established field margins in intensively managed grasslands. Three methods of field margin establishment were investigated including fencing, natural regeneration by rotavation, or seeding with a wildflower mixture. Subsequent sward management by either grazing or mowing was tested at three margin widths. Success of establishment was addressed in terms of persistence of species richness, plant community composition and incidence of noxious weeds. 3. Seeding with a wildflower mixture was the most successful establishment method to enhance plant species richness and this effect persisted throughout the 7 years of the experiment ( = 16 center dot 4 +/- 0 center dot 43 SE plant species richness per 1 x 3 m2 quadrat). Mown ( = 6 center dot 01 +/- 0 center dot 30 SE) and rotavated ( = 9 center dot 7 +/- 0 center dot 34 SE) treatments contained significantly fewer plant species; grazed controls contained 9 center dot 83 +/- 0 center dot 24 species. 4. Grazing led to a significant, but modest increase in species richness in fenced and rotavated plots compared to the mowing treatment, but had no effect in seeded plots. Grazing also led to an increased frequency and cover of competitive grasses in the seeded treatment. 5. Although margin width was not found to significantly influence species richness, there was increased herb cover and reduced abundance of noxious weeds in the wider seeded margins. 6.Synthesis and applications. The choice of establishment method and subsequent management of grassland field margins significantly affected their conservation value. The botanical diversity of margins within intensively managed pasture can be enhanced by sowing wildflower seed mixtures. This diversity can be maintained over time through appropriate management, i.e. either the reduction of high grazing pressure by seasonal fencing, or annual mowing. Management approaches that involve minimal change are currently adopted in many agri-environment schemes (such as fencing and/or the cessation of nutrient inputs) but did not produce swards of conservation value in this study.",48,3,551,560,Noxious weed; Grassland; Wildflower; Grazing; Pasture; Grazing pressure; Fencing; Species richness; Agroforestry; Biology,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20113186803.html https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01951.x https://core.ac.uk/display/58828162 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01951.x/abstract https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01951.x https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20113186803,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01951.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01951.x,1511826457,,0,000-271-857-070-759; 002-016-799-105-785; 003-251-732-418-644; 008-292-810-248-496; 011-749-985-776-165; 018-426-147-707-10X; 018-640-896-090-749; 020-549-193-345-308; 022-914-244-424-002; 023-103-648-255-011; 025-983-895-963-761; 026-162-389-848-750; 026-672-810-037-223; 031-862-039-493-29X; 036-882-579-432-228; 043-940-041-145-856; 044-351-103-625-865; 047-946-954-821-823; 055-236-476-487-210; 056-789-845-462-569; 060-190-757-297-843; 061-875-467-468-761; 063-574-629-144-561; 063-617-276-329-073; 065-565-421-487-993; 067-912-727-549-225; 075-376-170-994-818; 075-844-306-800-635; 080-139-567-968-521; 086-371-510-806-278; 093-151-276-890-967; 093-861-925-204-733; 095-014-169-963-827; 097-691-909-747-128; 097-940-408-467-683; 102-307-069-255-349; 106-891-114-899-41X; 115-507-657-132-984; 117-345-687-903-78X; 118-418-614-389-661; 120-262-642-164-869; 121-171-332-057-120; 129-154-893-686-206; 132-432-149-294-20X; 143-664-921-134-562; 144-915-982-059-308; 158-315-323-825-426; 171-465-178-732-227; 171-723-833-352-554; 197-392-866-862-614,30

Musters; Jerry van Dijk; Geert R. de Snoo,"Sown, temporary field margins are a common agri-environment scheme (AES) in the Netherlands. Despite their wide application, though, there has been scarcely any long-term monitoring of the succession of invertebrates. In the field margins of 40 farms, invertebrate diversity and the abundance of three functional groups were assessed in relation to age. The diversity in terms of number of species groups was found to increase with the age of the margins. The abundance of herbivores and detritivores also showed a positive correlation with the age of the margins. However, the abundance of predators decreased with increasing age. Older margins showed a higher total vegetation cover and fewer plant species, also resulting in lower plant species evenness. We suggest several changes to the current AES regulations. For the conservation of invertebrate diversity, longer-lasting field margins are desirable. In addition, old margins are favoured by detritivores, a group that has particular difficulty finding suitable habitats in agricultural landscapes. However, such margins are less favourable from an agricultural perspective, as they appear unsuitable for high abundances of potentially useful predators and the high vegetation cover attracts many potentially harmful herbivores. To circumvent this, the AES might be extended by incorporating hay-making, which would reduce standing biomass and might lead to more predators and fewer herbivores.",19,11,3255,3268,Species evenness; Biodiversity; Ecological succession; Detritivore; Habitat; Global biodiversity; Predation; Ecology; Herbivore; Biology,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-010-9890-1/fulltext.html https://edepot.wur.nl/350460 http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/186819 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103300582.html http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/402837 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103300582 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-010-9890-1 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10531-010-9890-1.pdf http://edepot.wur.nl/350460,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-010-9890-1,,10.1007/s10531-010-9890-1,2129602914,,0,002-941-996-041-459; 003-223-037-571-948; 003-460-280-575-85X; 005-769-046-282-205; 006-545-720-817-552; 006-610-037-754-129; 010-435-720-029-617; 012-187-317-384-830; 012-357-805-545-268; 012-996-740-466-059; 013-267-478-338-997; 015-472-264-399-650; 018-028-975-115-624; 020-564-612-156-583; 025-149-893-113-195; 025-983-895-963-761; 031-579-378-413-334; 032-683-791-612-712; 032-991-953-185-288; 036-869-496-663-040; 039-208-787-164-04X; 042-303-914-852-499; 046-922-146-668-557; 049-088-413-362-630; 051-685-596-945-405; 052-363-993-930-092; 052-683-414-660-01X; 054-715-078-148-813; 056-099-523-856-735; 056-585-869-238-25X; 056-789-845-462-569; 057-186-934-575-091; 060-626-812-234-007; 062-862-594-534-518; 063-482-802-144-699; 068-123-496-822-558; 068-339-344-971-039; 070-052-126-358-336; 070-239-213-610-528; 070-314-903-562-073; 070-703-492-655-943; 071-245-262-326-969; 073-359-404-037-66X; 074-793-529-288-006; 075-276-217-181-614; 076-307-235-228-944; 076-729-975-056-738; 079-892-551-731-823; 080-139-567-968-521; 080-348-794-816-190; 082-052-461-611-277; 084-060-537-067-160; 091-355-794-203-313; 093-275-781-286-407; 096-960-066-363-762; 097-135-941-783-666; 100-038-531-979-078; 101-656-029-176-741; 108-606-742-009-569; 109-691-661-850-685; 111-528-391-156-029; 115-507-657-132-984; 117-319-504-327-830; 117-345-687-903-78X; 124-362-582-173-520; 126-785-052-582-631; 127-887-135-040-882; 131-060-331-668-772; 132-380-117-709-640; 135-233-059-071-616; 137-714-153-495-730; 142-702-627-936-466; 145-653-851-729-665; 149-200-651-727-319; 152-174-341-381-190; 155-691-175-864-748; 161-300-804-429-199; 163-430-104-815-820; 167-175-414-731-307; 175-927-412-841-616; 178-411-469-458-660; 179-048-991-295-983; 184-899-964-527-087; 186-514-899-659-616; 186-739-979-596-835; 187-603-367-498-373; 188-468-956-254-948; 188-485-343-828-456; 194-464-477-426-158,28

Bragan; J. L. Starr; T. B. Parkin,"We field tested a short term, in situ method for measuring highly variable shallow groundwater denitrification rates using a methodology developed in an earlier, laboratory phase of this study. A pulse of tracer solution was injected and subsequently sampled within well clusters 50 cm in radius. The injectate contained dissolved acetylene (C 2 H 2 ) to block denitrification at the nitrous oxide (N 2 O) stage of reduction. Six well clusters were established at two depths along a riparian area transect through field, grass, and woodland ecotypes. Bromide tracer, C 2 H 2 , and accumulated N 2 O were monitored at sample wells downgradient from each injection well. Adequate C 2 H 2 concentrations (0.43 mM) to block N 2 O reduction between injection and sample wells were attained in five of the six well clusters tested. Acetylene peak concentrations moved laterally an average of 19% more slowly than the Br peak, N 2 O peak concentrations an average of 8% after C 2 H 2 peaks. Highest denitrification rates of 2.8 and 3.3 mg N L -1 d -1 were observed near the surface of the water table within the grass buffer and riparian forest. Shallow groundwater denitrification rates in the adjoining field and 2 m deep into the saturated zone at all three ecotypes were <25% of the highest rates. Acetylene block procedures were thus used to determine in situ denitrification rates within a few days time with little disruption of soil structure or associated microbial communities.

026-689-206-139-259,Water body and riparian buffer strip characteristics in a vineyard area to support aquatic pesticide exposure assessment,2010-10-15,2010,journal article,The Science of the total environment,18791026; 00489697,Elsevier,Netherlands,Renja Ohliger; Ralf Schulz,"Abstract The implementation of a geodata-based probabilistic pesticide exposure assessment for surface waters in Germany offers the opportunity to base the exposure estimation on more differentiated assumptions including detailed landscape characteristics. Since these characteristics can only be estimated using field surveys, water body width and depth, hydrology, riparian buffer strip width, ground vegetation cover, existence of concentrated flow paths, and riparian vegetation were characterised at 104 water body segments in the vineyard region Palatinate (south-west Germany). Water body segments classified as permanent (n = 43) had median values of water body width and depth of 0.9 m and 0.06 m, respectively, and the determined median width:depth ratio was 15. Thus, the deterministic water body model (width = 1 m; depth = 0.3 m) assumed in regulatory exposure assessment seems unsuitable for small water bodies in the study area. Only 25% of investigated buffer strips had a dense vegetation cover (> 70%) and allow a laminar sheet flow as required to include them as an effective pesticide runoff reduction landscape characteristic. At 77 buffer strips, bordering field paths and erosion rills leading into the water body were present, concentrating pesticide runoff and consequently decreasing buffer strip efficiency. The vegetation type shrubbery (height > 1.5 m) was present at 57 (29%) investigated riparian buffer strips. According to their median optical vegetation density of 75%, shrubberies may provide a spray drift reduction of 72 ± 29%. Implementing detailed knowledge in an overall assessment revealed that exposure via drift might be 2.4 and via runoff up to 1.6 fold higher than assumed by the deterministic approach. Furthermore, considering vegetated buffer strips only by their width leads to an underestimation of exposure by a factor of as much as four. Our data highlight that the deterministic model assumptions neither represent worst-case nor median values and therefore cannot simply be adopted in a probabilistic approach.",408,22,5405,5413,Riparian zone; Riparian buffer; Buffer zone; Vegetation type; Hydrology; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Surface water; Water pollution,,"Crops, Agricultural/growth & development; Environmental Exposure/analysis; Environmental Monitoring; Fresh Water/chemistry; Pesticides/analysis; Vitis/growth & development; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis; Water Pollution, Chemical/prevention & control; Wine","Pesticides; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ScTEn.408.5405O/abstract https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969710008582 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20817261 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103315031 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103315031.html http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969710008582,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.08.025,20817261,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.08.025,2159730062,,0,001-021-964-543-19X; 002-192-170-153-563; 002-948-953-603-150; 003-148-094-786-550; 005-046-617-641-306; 007-345-463-652-047; 008-380-052-396-94X; 009-742-460-635-737; 010-818-332-920-449; 012-661-878-658-884; 019-057-578-554-139; 021-655-763-861-159; 027-700-674-628-978; 028-982-276-079-365; 036-456-610-975-852; 046-258-994-971-855; 052-320-986-023-291; 052-589-530-283-548; 055-928-057-358-040; 056-444-102-079-143; 102-602-517-987-677; 104-230-077-662-702; 154-084-103-526-669; 161-603-632-608-913; 175-950-958-362-911; 181-090-792-931-175,27

The objective of this study was to investigate the temporal evolution of dissolved atrazine, metolachlor, and deethylatrazine (DEA) concentrations as well as the DEA to atrazine ratio (DAR) values in runoff from grass filter strips for the first (four to five) rain events occurring after annual herbicide application over four seasons (1998 to 2001) under natural rain conditions. The 16 plots (65 m long by 3 m wide [213 ft long by 10 ft wide]) were laid in a completely randomized block design with four treatments: 0 m filter strip and grass filter strips of 3, 6, or 9 m (10, 20, or 30 ft). The soil texture was 42% silt, 38% sand, and 20% clay with 3.1% of organic matter; the pH was 6.3; and the slope was 2% to 3%. Runoff-generating plots were left bare in order to maximize runoff. The strips were composed of 45% creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra L.), 45% bent grass (Agrostis alba L.), and 10% perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Grass filter strips reduced exported dissolved herbicide concentrations at least by half for the first two rainfalls of each study year. By the end of the sampling period for each season, dissolved concentrations for grass filter strips were most of the time, except for metolachlor in the 6 m grass strip in 1999, less than the criteria for the protection of aquatic life (chronic) (7.8 μg L−1 [7.8 ppb] for metolachlor (provisory) and 1.8 μg L−1 [1.8 ppb] for atrazine), which was not the case with the 0 m strip. Grass filter strips reduced the frequency at which these criteria were exceeded. Generally, exported dissolved herbicide concentrations decreased with time except when a rain event of high intensity occurred. DAR values never exceeded 0.66 and generally showed an increasing trend with time during the sampling periods of 1998 to 2000. Grass filter strips are an efficient mitigation measure against the risk of contamination of surface waters by atrazine and metolachlor.",68,5,419,427,Randomized block design; Soil texture; Lolium perenne; Agrostis; Festuca rubra; Metolachlor; Atrazine; Filter strip; Environmental science; Agronomy,,,,,https://www.jswconline.org/content/68/5/419.full.pdf https://www.jswconline.org/content/68/5/419 https://www.jswconline.org/lookup/doi/10.2489/jswc.68.5.419 http://espace.inrs.ca/6421/,http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.68.5.419,,10.2489/jswc.68.5.419,2328191388,,0,000-279-995-037-216; 000-357-531-495-738; 007-029-250-638-239; 007-985-273-091-256; 011-230-574-777-701; 015-334-237-353-133; 019-057-578-554-139; 019-986-408-945-555; 022-491-237-741-390; 023-229-653-654-803; 024-556-636-186-088; 036-456-610-975-852; 045-183-737-727-595; 052-320-986-023-291; 053-361-949-593-735; 078-927-735-353-813; 088-334-197-330-778; 094-049-137-663-313; 096-878-710-039-072; 113-621-019-415-011; 119-010-695-168-082; 175-111-291-377-228; 178-140-173-536-98X; 199-436-393-511-658,1

Brown; Norman J. Rosenberg,"Two rows of corn windbreaks spaced at 15 m were used to protect an irrigated sugar beet crop at Scottsbluff, Nebraska. Yield data for wind protected sugar beet crops from three consecutive years indicate that yield increases of as much as 25% are possible during years when yields are low. During years of high yield, however, the windbreaks did not increase sugar beet yield further.; ; Except in the immediate vicinity of the windbreak where shading occurred, no differences were found in net radiation between the sheltered and open plots. The daytime air temperature averaged 1.8°C greater and the vapor pressure 4.0 mbar greater in the sheltered plot than in the open. Both air temperature and the water vapor pressure varied as a function of distance from the windbreaks. An area of maximum influence was often observed near the center of the protected plot. Differences between shelter and open were decreased during periods of strong wind. Differences in temperature and vapor pressure between shelter and open were greater during the day than at night. The wind speed at 25 cm above the crop was 40% of that in the open field whenever wind speed in the open was more than 120 cm/sec. The daytime concentration of CO2 was an average of 1 p.p.m. lower in shelter than in the open. Nocturnal concentration was an average of 3.5 p.p.m. greater in shelter. The latter differences were inversely related to wind speed and were greatest when wind direction was perpendicular to the windbreak. Vertical mixing in the atmosphere is, apparently, vigorous enough to prevent significant depletion of CO2 in a windbreak protected field. The 1 p.p.m. lower concentration observed over the sheltered crop should have only a negligible influence on photosynthetic rate.; ; The increase in vapor pressure and the slight decrease in [CO2] during the day suggest a decrease in the intensity of turbulent exchange in shelter.

Plush; Christopher E. Moorman; David B. Orr; Chris Reberg-Horton,"Field borders are an effective conservation strategy for providing habitat to overwintering sparrows, and may be a venue through which beneficial insect populations are promoted. However, traditional fallow field borders lack sufficient pollen and nectar sources required to sustain beneficial insect populations; therefore, borders planted to a mix of native prairie flowers and grasses may be needed if increases in beneficial insect populations are desired. Although the value of fallow borders to birds has been established, little is known about bird use of beneficial insect habitats. Using single-observer transect surveys, we compared overwintering sparrow densities among 4 field border treatments (planted native warm season grasses and prairie flowers, planted prairie flowers only, fallow, and mowed) replicated around 9 organic crop fields from November to March 2009-2010 and 2010-2011. Sparrow densities were 5-10 times lower in mowed borders than in other border treatments in 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, but did not differ among planted and fallow borders in either year. Planted field borders may be a useful conservation practice for providing habitat for both overwintering sparrows and beneficial insects. 2012 The Wildlife Society.",77,1,200,206,Organic farming; Crop; Nectar; Habitat; Ecology; Overwintering; Beneficial insects; Sparrow; Wildlife; Biology,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jwmg.436/abstract https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jwmg.436,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.436,,10.1002/jwmg.436,2155459917,,0,000-281-554-875-962; 001-606-475-599-372; 002-669-586-055-41X; 003-251-732-418-644; 005-519-581-202-375; 007-345-255-242-473; 008-157-210-875-523; 009-172-624-760-904; 013-746-156-265-893; 017-298-227-855-778; 018-655-554-147-217; 027-356-962-068-696; 029-067-159-542-004; 033-683-367-611-100; 035-722-271-486-44X; 037-574-041-312-656; 038-659-320-814-260; 040-618-665-169-421; 042-303-914-852-499; 043-009-269-441-396; 049-232-392-726-987; 050-605-450-949-818; 057-422-273-983-435; 060-919-763-672-172; 068-567-084-277-634; 069-136-220-181-306; 072-312-107-731-52X; 082-139-829-269-53X; 082-797-391-654-568; 085-003-189-523-400; 106-173-595-941-095; 111-637-517-388-46X; 128-222-836-109-002; 133-199-519-838-349; 133-312-041-845-209; 139-420-527-826-792; 143-615-245-322-881; 148-639-915-345-985; 151-940-400-036-949; 173-725-585-059-659; 191-508-311-193-465,8

A total of 390 male and 373 female beetles was examined. Each female was dissected and the number of ripe eggs counted. The nutritional state was expressed by a condition factor, which was calculated for each individual based on the observed weight and elytra length of male and female P. cupreus. Carabids in the 1-year-old wildflower areas contained significantly less ripe eggs than those from the 4-year-old areas. The condition factor of female and male beetles was significantly lower in 1- than 2- to 4-year-old areas. We examined the influence of habitat parameters (vegetation cover, soil water content, coarse and fine sand, pore volume, habitat size and age, surrounding landscape structure) on the reproductive success and nutritional state of P. cupreus in the 16 wildflower areas. The number of eggs was best explained by habitat age, accounting for 53.4% of the variability. The variation in the condition factor of female and male beetles was best explained by habitat age, which accounted for 73% and 71% of the variation, respectively. Moreover, the beetles' reproductive potential and nutritional condition were significantly associated with vegetation cover, and occasionally also with soil water content. The potential of wildflower areas as a reservoir for the generalist predator P. cupreus was shown to increase with successional age.",135,1,78,83,Reproductive success; Secondary succession; Habitat; Ecology; Wildflower; Poecilus cupreus; Pterostichus; Generalist and specialist species; Biology; Predator,,Animals; Coleoptera; Ecosystem; Environment; Female; Fertility; Male; Nutritional Status; Ovum; Population Dynamics; Predatory Behavior; Time Factors; Water,Water,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12647106/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12647106 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003Oecol.135...78B/abstract https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-002-1175-2 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/12647106,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-002-1175-2,12647106,10.1007/s00442-002-1175-2,2084722595,,0,002-840-565-989-288; 006-032-470-194-888; 009-527-929-221-979; 012-357-805-545-268; 017-032-049-057-221; 018-180-493-134-781; 021-239-653-544-045; 025-308-920-573-935; 025-549-853-256-127; 027-873-912-072-078; 031-821-491-704-144; 032-086-235-419-668; 037-241-390-682-529; 052-649-478-130-801; 053-832-610-795-117; 054-732-742-341-262; 054-813-020-227-286; 057-105-984-779-319; 058-105-561-757-413; 058-743-931-737-265; 062-036-445-726-722; 063-112-903-921-487; 064-338-086-975-394; 064-893-774-544-494; 068-047-302-619-518; 072-208-659-152-26X; 076-366-425-601-041; 076-851-991-319-613; 100-101-071-041-044; 106-530-677-319-614; 123-421-331-693-40X; 123-653-571-393-994; 126-523-292-625-83X; 133-540-484-254-808; 134-921-760-522-115; 142-547-556-180-595; 149-431-649-896-445; 150-802-697-211-901; 163-705-553-703-20X; 169-134-117-425-858; 175-135-717-976-663,33

Canavelli; Lyn C. Branch; Pedro Cavallero; Cristina González; María Elena Zaccagnini,"Bird damage to agricultural crops is an important cause of economic loss for farmers worldwide. Predictive habitat models relating bird abundance and damage to characteristics of the agricultural environment at multiple scales are a key tool for designing management programs to reduce impacts of birds on agricultural production. In this study, we explored habitat features influencing abundance and damage of monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus) to corn (Zea mays) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) fields, as a basis for the design and evaluation of management strategies for preventing damage in the future. Using a multi-level approach, we evaluated within-field, field, and landscape variables at three spatial scales potentially related to monk parakeet abundance and damage in crop fields. Monk parakeet abundance and damage was greater in sunflower than in corn fields. Landscape variables, such as distance to nearest site with trees, percentage of landscape with trees, and availability of foraging sites for monk parakeets around the crop fields were more important than local variables in explaining monk parakeet damage to crop fields. However, local variables, such as field area, plant density and percentage of field border with trees, also were related to damage. Relationships varied depending on the crop under consideration and spatial scale of analysis. Based on this study, managers should consider both local and landscape factors when planning management measures to prevent bird damage to crops.",197,,128,136,Agriculture; Agricultural productivity; Spatial ecology; Foraging; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Monachus; Parakeet; Abundance (ecology),,,,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5324206 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880914003843,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2014.07.024,,10.1016/j.agee.2014.07.024,2052604324,,0,008-130-068-915-677; 011-508-246-956-659; 012-389-049-437-101; 013-432-073-722-532; 019-200-716-526-064; 024-240-876-657-562; 024-924-476-251-122; 032-230-838-077-605; 033-112-139-950-734; 045-640-805-432-475; 045-767-878-168-132; 054-585-052-877-054; 054-907-467-777-871; 055-240-083-707-27X; 055-823-248-440-177; 058-633-444-345-216; 060-681-766-852-577; 062-536-654-582-201; 066-347-110-782-638; 066-755-808-807-940; 073-093-352-803-477; 073-541-983-713-335; 078-070-242-722-190; 078-395-734-887-86X; 088-632-746-173-046; 091-275-725-832-431; 092-660-214-259-845; 098-959-317-290-559; 105-145-742-902-746; 108-180-151-248-204; 111-085-619-662-631; 122-206-717-263-455; 122-685-280-417-669; 136-446-153-249-957; 150-162-603-118-587; 156-939-845-099-997; 160-535-386-199-588; 164-537-087-416-559; 169-942-708-115-240; 177-400-081-703-332; 191-298-765-955-492; 193-214-095-538-439; 199-963-057-360-197,25

Moorman; Charles J. Plush; David B. Orr; Chris Reberg-Horton,"Strips of fallow vegetation along cropland borders are an effective strategy for providing brood habitat for declining populations of upland game birds (Order: Galliformes), including northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), but fallow borders lack nectar-producing vegetation needed to sustain many beneficial insect populations (e.g., crop pest predators, parasitoids, and pollinator species). Planted borders that contain mixes of prairie flowers and grasses are designed to harbor more diverse arthropod communities, but the relative value of these borders as brood habitat is unknown. We used groups of six human-imprinted northern bobwhite chicks as a bioassay for comparing four different border treatments (planted native grass and prairie flowers, planted prairie flowers only, fallow vegetation, or mowed vegetation) as northern bobwhite brood habitat from June-August 2009 and 2010. All field border treatments were established around nine organic crop fields. Groups of chicks were led through borders for 30-min foraging trials and immediately euthanized, and eaten arthropods in crops and gizzards were measured to calculate a foraging rate for each border treatment. We estimated arthropod prey availability within each border treatment using a modified blower-vac to sample arthropods at the vegetation strata where chicks foraged. Foraging rate did not differ among border treatments in 2009 or 2010. Total arthropod prey densities calculated from blower-vac samples did not differ among border treatments in 2009 or 2010. Our results showed plant communities established to attract beneficial insects should maximize the biodiversity potential of field border establishment by providing habitat for beneficial insects and young upland game birds.",8,12,e83815,,Brood; Biodiversity; Foraging; Vegetation; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Beneficial insects; Plant community; Biology,,"Animals; Biodiversity; Colinus; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Humans; Insecta",,,https://paperity.org/p/60682329/beneficial-insect-borders-provide-northern-bobwhite-brood-habitat http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0083815 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013PLoSO...883815M/abstract https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3871610 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3871610,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0083815,24376759,10.1371/journal.pone.0083815,2093381116,PMC3871610,0,002-061-575-446-364; 002-669-586-055-41X; 003-891-980-805-016; 009-172-624-760-904; 012-466-311-051-172; 022-667-644-785-266; 027-591-409-062-387; 034-350-057-263-068; 040-618-665-169-421; 042-303-914-852-499; 045-088-035-767-327; 055-079-577-779-662; 056-892-630-404-500; 061-286-461-331-769; 070-904-067-298-325; 071-511-859-224-147; 072-312-107-731-52X; 082-797-391-654-568; 097-789-429-598-931; 098-088-417-013-531; 109-033-943-450-108; 121-111-684-893-259; 127-944-368-077-481; 143-273-453-722-006; 166-806-633-528-132; 175-715-108-169-648,7

This also applies to the experimental releases of GM plants in field trials. Therefore, biosafety measures such as isolation distances and surveying of PMGF are required by the regulatory authorities in Switzerland. For two and three years, respectively, we monitored crop-to-crop PMGF from GM wheat field trials in two locations in Switzerland. The pollen donors were two GM spring wheat lines with enhanced fungal resistance and a herbicide tolerance as a selection marker. Seeds from the experimental plots were sampled to test the detection method for outcrosses. Two outcrosses were found adjacent to a transgenic plot within the experimental area. For the survey of PMGF, pollen receptor plots of the conventional wheat variety Frisal used for transformation were planted in the border crop and around the experimental field up to a distance of 200 m.

Monitoring results revealed the efficiency of this buffer system in removing nitrogen. This site was compared with other buffer strips designed according to the technical specifications of Italian Standard 5.2 in Italy (M.D. 27417, December 22, 2011). While some of the systems resulted very effective in inorganic nitrogen removal, reaching values of 62 and 75%, two of the monitored sites resulted completely ineffective even if realized according to the required technical specifications. Our results indicate that this was due to a lack of hydraulic connectivity with Corg-rich active soil layers in contact with the rhizosphere. A comparison of the main factors limiting nitrogen retention is proposed, highlighting the key role played by hydrology and in particular by groundwater depth and soil carbon availability. One of the most common objections to the prescriptions of Cross-compliance standard 5.2, concerning the excessive narrowness of buffer strips (5 m), did not seem to be particularly relevant. Starting from the comparison of monitoring results obtained at different experimental sites, this contribution provides practical indications about the correct planning and management of buffer strips for nitrogen retention.",103,,446,454,Buffer (optical fiber); Soil horizon; Riparian-zone restoration; Environmental science; Soil carbon; Buffer strip; Organic matter; Nitrogen; Hydrology (agriculture); Environmental engineering,,,,"Consorzio di Bonifica Acque Risorgive, Regione Veneto; MiPAAF; FEASR",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925857416302579,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.05.031,,10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.05.031,2408855924,,0,004-564-524-148-882; 008-146-166-715-288; 008-467-759-539-985; 009-379-307-440-518; 010-020-076-032-473; 013-519-812-630-976; 014-316-223-277-453; 015-514-563-181-208; 016-631-580-288-647; 017-885-841-853-429; 017-917-296-565-694; 019-956-026-948-622; 020-977-235-603-557; 033-264-136-247-819; 037-869-723-647-435; 040-105-031-136-536; 044-537-569-855-131; 044-948-727-495-773; 056-572-672-082-930; 058-706-321-707-453; 060-016-843-734-137; 066-685-695-257-557; 067-085-306-119-810; 073-703-019-282-474; 087-168-688-204-963; 088-175-727-127-094; 089-451-952-829-708; 089-453-874-107-898; 101-888-749-870-953; 102-452-865-692-76X; 113-815-899-269-184; 120-522-014-726-902; 126-928-891-633-271; 127-110-771-551-744; 136-351-396-697-760; 144-808-239-711-853; 169-607-559-923-667; 177-223-877-096-350; 183-950-947-180-178,6

These oods are triggered when high quantities of runo are generated on cropland and cause severe erosion. Three soil surface characteristics are relevant to determine the runo potential of cultivated soils: soil cover by crops and residues, soil surface crust-ing and roughness. These characteristics have been observed on 65 cultivated elds throughout 2005. A heavy rainfall event representative for events triggering muddy oods in the region (60 mm.h −1 during 30 minutes) has been simulated using a 0.5 m 2 simulator on elds with the 17 most observed combinations of soil surface characteristics in central Belgium. In the case of (ploughed) bare uncrusted soils, runo is not observed, nor in the case of soils covered by crops, showing a transitional crust and a moderate roughness (1-2 cm). In the cases where runo has been observed, mean runo coecients ranged from 13% (wheat in July) to 58% (sugar beet or maize in May and June). Grassed buer strips (GBS) and grassed waterways (GWW) show a higher runo coecient (62% for GBS and 73% for GWW) than most cultivated soils (13-58%). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that small plot measurements can be used to estimate runo generation at the eld scale. A classication of runo generation risk based on the surveys of soil surface characteristics has been applied to common crops of central Belgium. February as well as the period between May and September are the most critical for runo at the eld scale. However, it appears from monitoring of a 16ha-catchment that the highest runoff volumes and peak discharges are recorded between May and August after heavy rainfall, explaining why 85% of muddy floods are recorded during this period in central Belgium.",33,8,1285,1301,Erosion; Runoff curve number; Urban runoff; Soil water; Loess; Hydrology; Environmental science; Agricultural land; Surface runoff; Flood myth,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ESPL...33.1285E/abstract https://hal-cea.archives-ouvertes.fr/cea-02511869/document http://core.ac.uk/display/34191235 https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:36454 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/esp.1613 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/cea-02511869v1 https://hal-cea.archives-ouvertes.fr/cea-02511869v1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.1613,,10.1002/esp.1613,2038064831,,0,002-206-195-990-960; 009-468-621-105-069; 011-627-453-383-445; 012-360-928-841-38X; 012-950-452-965-183; 013-383-050-421-747; 015-159-212-900-799; 016-210-220-419-097; 021-863-165-975-101; 025-160-206-463-837; 034-946-583-952-83X; 039-805-051-357-354; 050-198-618-361-634; 050-754-216-214-169; 051-977-236-741-374; 052-589-530-283-548; 061-329-945-465-357; 064-060-898-906-550; 064-426-922-912-154; 064-922-510-478-219; 065-544-351-338-227; 069-066-158-720-776; 069-886-182-022-795; 070-156-038-664-620; 070-314-573-875-21X; 070-963-307-072-465; 072-892-575-196-779; 078-941-624-364-000; 079-326-413-920-136; 083-431-696-176-966; 090-875-555-544-711; 096-208-638-422-460; 106-284-569-265-355; 109-207-190-837-590; 115-324-274-797-645; 116-723-108-473-594; 117-346-312-542-660; 117-570-639-891-826; 138-146-309-524-176; 142-630-095-786-662; 146-670-572-557-590; 147-322-551-945-32X; 153-259-039-057-508; 159-379-305-574-327; 160-724-809-014-446; 161-253-688-981-71X; 171-210-880-000-339; 182-417-171-721-245; 184-120-604-176-760; 194-158-767-830-671; 194-538-872-888-108,43

Concentration method was used for seed bank samples. Grime’s plant strategies were used to explain observed patterns. The analysis of the seed bank of these hedge banks showed that the species richness and diversity differed in relation to the date of construction of the hedge banks. The seed banks of recent hedge banks were richer and more diversified than those of old hedge banks. Differences in the floristic composition of the established plant cover between the recent and old hedge banks were determined by multivariate analyses. The species exclusively found in the seed bank and in the herb cover of recent hedge banks were mainly grassland species, whereas the species that only occurred on old hedge banks tended to be woodland species. The floristic composition of the two compartments (established vegetation and seed bank) was very different. A multivariate analysis revealed that the difference between the composition of the seed banks of recent and old hedge banks was less than that between the composition of the established vegetation and seed bank of hedge banks of the same age.

Isenhart; Richard C. Schultz,"ABSTRACT: Riparian buffers are widely recommended as a tool for removing nonpoint source pollutants from agricultural areas especially those carried by surface runoff. A field plot study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of an established multi-species buffer in trapping sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus from cropland runoff during natural rainfall events. Triplicate plots were installed in a previously established buffer with a 4.1 by 22.1 m (14 × 73 ft.) cropland source area paired with either no buffer, a 7.1 m (23 ft) switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L. cv. Cave-n-Rock) buffer, or a 16.3 m (53.5 ft) switchgrass/woody buffer (7.1 m swithgrass/9.2 m woody) located at the lower end of each plot. The switchgrass buffer removed 95% of the sediment, 80% of the total-nitrogen (N), 62% of the nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), 78% of the total-phosphorus (P), and 58% of the phosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P). The switchgrass/woody buffer removed 97% of the sediment, 94% of the total-N, 85% of the NO3-N, 91% of the total-P, and 80% of the PO4-P in the runoff. There was a significant negative correlation between the trapping effectiveness of the buffers and the intensity and total rainfall of individual storms. While the 7 m (23 ft) switchgrass buffer was effective in removing sediment and sediment-bound nutrients, the added width of the 16.3 m (53.5 ft) switchgrass/woody buffer increased the removal efficiency of soluble nutrients by over 20%. Similar or even greater reductions might have been found if the 16.3 m (53.5 ft) buffer had been planted completely to native warm-season grasses. In this buffer, combinations of the dense, stiff, native warm-season grass and woody vegetation improved the removal effectiveness for the nonpoint source pollutants from agricultural areas.",58,1,1,8,Riparian zone; Erosion; Nonpoint source pollution; Riparian buffer; Panicum virgatum; Sediment; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Agronomy; Water pollution,,,,,http://www.lsln.net.au/jspui/handle/1/3678 http://www.jswconline.org/content/58/1/1.short https://www.jswconline.org/content/58/1/1,https://www.jswconline.org/content/58/1/1,,,2111584899,,0,013-639-110-556-018; 040-935-957-450-37X; 045-051-399-949-632; 047-134-935-944-533; 059-381-194-377-394; 072-307-357-826-584; 076-826-572-086-275; 084-079-962-946-852; 087-168-688-204-963; 088-526-158-902-16X; 115-642-860-718-878; 128-195-997-346-382; 134-191-656-379-548; 141-101-347-131-583; 161-254-905-134-539; 169-607-559-923-667; 180-524-585-737-168,262

To test this hypothesis, the plant species composition of field margins in three hedgerow network landscapes differing in grain size, hedgerow connectivity and land use patterns were compared. Variation partitioning by partial canonical correspondence analysis was used to assess the relative weight of local and landscape factors in total variation explained. Results showed that the three sets of local factors and the landscape factor were all significant. We conclude that the plant species composition of field margins is determined by landscape scale variation in environment attributes, and discuss implications for conservation.",37,1-2,57,71,Canonical correspondence analysis; Field (geography); Ecology; Geography; Variation (linguistics); Scale variation; Relative weight; Landscape structure; Plant diversity; Land use,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204696003702,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0169-2046(96)00370-2,,10.1016/s0169-2046(96)00370-2,1982262934,,0,000-724-723-869-10X; 010-250-877-529-926; 011-018-985-835-509; 012-335-108-074-344; 016-915-486-723-598; 024-608-779-166-000; 032-961-767-789-531; 036-681-752-627-926; 057-001-477-328-971; 058-767-657-165-968; 059-329-843-933-20X; 078-966-178-941-701; 080-357-443-253-546; 082-859-595-391-633; 083-714-994-906-170; 086-054-490-291-916; 109-949-301-670-192; 119-139-897-303-411; 121-270-336-123-002; 125-502-070-507-978; 144-650-014-019-56X; 150-494-637-604-381; 174-706-848-200-347; 187-050-769-304-212; 187-941-892-082-802; 195-789-936-484-982,106

However, due to their small size and low habitat quality, long-term population survival cannot be ascertained and often active management is needed to maintain viable populations of species forced to survive in these small landscape elements.; ; ; ; 2. Population models are needed to assess the threats to species at risk and to evaluate alternative management actions. Here, we present a methodology to evaluate management interventions using spatio-temporal analyses of point patterns. We apply this method to several populations of primrose Primula vulgaris in Flanders, where it is rare and predominantly occurs along ditch banks.; ; ; ; 3. The effects of ditch bank clearing on the establishment success of seedlings was investigated by comparing spatial patterns of seedling recruitment, survival and mortality between populations that were grazed and populations that were severely disturbed by mechanical clearing of ditch banks followed by annual mowing. A total of 884 seedlings were mapped and monitored during 4 consecutive years (1999–2002).; ; ; ; 4. In all populations, plants showed significant clustering, but in cleared sites only seedlings were significantly clustered around adults. Spatial patterns of mortality varied according to the management intervention. In grazed sites, mortality was almost random, whereas in cleared sites we found clear evidence for strong negative density-dependent mortality. There was no evidence that the presence of adults affected survival of recruits in any of the sites studied.; ; ; ; 5. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that the analysis of spatial point patterns contributes to our understanding of the population dynamics of plant species occurring in different environments. The approach can be broadly applied to other plant species to elucidate the processes that determine the number of individuals that establish and persist into later life stages and will help conservation managers to refine management strategies intended to conserve or restore plant populations. In the case of P. vulgaris, increasing the availability of microsites is most likely to result in increased growth rates, as it results in increased recruitment and establishment of recruits.",47,2,431,440,Small population size; Habitat; Ecology; Threatened species; Primula; Ditch; Primula vulgaris; Population; Biology; Landscape ecology,,,,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01778.x https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01778.x https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01778.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01778.x/full https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103106374.html https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103106374 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01778.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01778.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01778.x,1984234672,,0,006-117-640-704-899; 007-051-869-220-785; 007-243-303-723-240; 011-981-991-153-956; 012-140-397-274-261; 014-226-881-970-330; 016-361-548-488-449; 016-441-096-350-667; 019-561-398-409-287; 020-337-471-283-940; 020-557-706-551-052; 023-329-564-430-291; 023-526-242-983-953; 023-741-290-606-644; 024-372-050-310-727; 027-358-728-130-470; 028-802-106-240-151; 034-655-966-435-231; 038-005-968-271-42X; 038-330-962-251-259; 042-168-379-149-822; 046-132-571-673-529; 048-993-130-625-510; 050-766-873-429-301; 050-800-300-566-102; 052-363-993-930-092; 065-445-565-716-381; 065-575-291-882-053; 067-996-338-341-210; 070-670-406-630-355; 073-326-972-969-093; 074-793-529-288-006; 078-122-133-651-807; 080-698-063-412-790; 084-826-186-530-921; 085-694-092-829-994; 090-506-043-122-669; 098-030-950-611-415; 098-626-033-111-023; 100-229-431-513-918; 102-052-147-441-103; 102-453-816-094-40X; 107-392-557-041-981; 111-227-546-452-326; 113-949-831-730-396; 133-291-039-284-983; 134-966-841-077-26X; 137-121-966-403-502; 166-418-939-771-085; 179-758-514-775-999,34

This paper addresses these issues by using data collected from a detailed field experiment, carried out on two topographically different hillslopes (one steep and the other flat) located within an agricultural catchment in Western Australia. Continuous hydrometric data and measurements of chemical tracers, geochemical parameters, and NO3− concentrations taken from the shallow perched aquifer across riparian, midslope, and upland locations were analyzed and interpreted through a simple process-based numerical model of transport and reaction. The NO3− concentration data indicated that the temporal and spatial patterns of NO3− concentrations within the hillslopes are linked to the state of hydrological connectivity of the three landscape units as the shallow perched aquifer developed during the winter. Significant NO3− attenuation occurs within the riparian zones after the transport of NO3− from midslope sources begins. Application of a mixing model, which partitions the riparian zones into three water source components, and the numerical model of NO3− transport and reaction indicates that different mechanisms, dilution in the steep hillslope and denitrification in the flat hillslope, are responsible for much of the observed NO3− attenuation in the riparian zones. In this way, this work highlights the importance of hillslope topography in determining the relative roles of transport and reaction in NO3− attenuation and export from riparian zones. The experimental results also supported the use of the Damkohler number, a simple dimensionless number that is a measure of the competition between transport and reaction processes, which allowed a favorable comparison of our findings with previous results published in the literature for different geographical settings.",42,1,,,Riparian zone; Spatial ecology; Temporal scales; Hydrology; Environmental science; Water table; Nitrogen cycle; Biogeochemical cycle; Field experiment; Hydrology (agriculture),,,,,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2004WR003773 https://experts.illinois.edu/en/publications/nitrate-attenuation-in-agricultural-catchments-shifting-balances- https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/nitrate-attenuation-in-agricultural-catchments-shifting-balances- http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004WR003773/full https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2004WR003773 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006WRR....42.1408O/abstract http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004WR003773/abstract http://doi.wiley.com/10.1029/2004WR003773,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2004wr003773,,10.1029/2004wr003773,1950680159,,0,000-600-406-746-566; 001-662-739-036-159; 003-356-925-268-321; 008-719-189-249-131; 010-193-923-056-157; 010-679-825-860-432; 013-073-418-696-543; 014-316-223-277-453; 015-385-795-850-37X; 015-514-563-181-208; 018-957-748-286-745; 021-187-528-186-865; 027-192-664-469-274; 036-855-367-119-906; 037-517-723-823-989; 037-814-622-324-954; 039-759-555-727-422; 044-756-455-196-49X; 044-896-650-028-584; 050-142-218-297-554; 050-432-420-347-696; 055-437-854-621-677; 061-657-784-363-466; 061-869-444-752-275; 067-179-757-135-745; 069-528-467-565-486; 075-429-883-991-330; 077-323-396-597-683; 077-354-829-416-449; 080-589-148-600-106; 083-692-916-137-156; 098-259-311-561-39X; 098-341-372-489-363; 098-611-699-285-909; 100-845-850-323-114; 104-294-000-915-575; 108-223-424-313-129; 118-889-039-185-769; 123-304-899-254-597; 128-450-484-626-122; 131-356-170-760-035; 133-007-756-045-351; 139-999-086-652-437; 140-458-255-752-935; 146-805-620-565-604; 150-539-908-471-485; 150-956-990-756-590; 153-455-821-143-99X; 156-457-714-937-063; 161-998-765-884-873; 171-764-485-151-086; 177-282-681-753-988; 177-521-755-905-661; 189-610-958-302-553,123

Schlosser; James R. Karr,"ABSTRACT: Water quality was monitored for 17 months during base flow periods in six agricultural watersheds to evaluate the impact of riparian vegetation on suspended solids and nutrient concentrations. In areas without riparian vegetation, both instream algal production and seasonal low flows appeared to be major determinants of suspended solids, turbidity, and phosphorus concentrations. Peak levels of all parameters were reached during the summer when flows were reduced and benthic algal production was high. Similar summer peaks were reached in streams receiving major point inputs but peaks occurred downstream from the input. Instream organic production was less important in regulating water quality in areas with riparian vegetation and permanent flows. Concentrations of suspended solids remained relatively constant, while phosphorus and turbidity increased in association with leaf fall in autumn. Intermittent flow conditions in summer increased the importance of instream organic production in controlling water quality, even when riparian vegetation was present. Efforts to improve water quality in agricultural watersheds during base flow should emphasize maintenance of riparian vegetation and stable flow conditions.",17,2,233,240,Riparian zone; Nutrient; Riparian forest; Suspended solids; Water quality; Flow conditions; Hydrology; Environmental science; Turbidity; Benthic zone; Environmental engineering,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981JAWRA..17..233S/abstract https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1981.tb03927.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1981.tb03927.x/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1981.tb03927.x,,10.1111/j.1752-1688.1981.tb03927.x,2136722724,,0,004-528-958-577-088; 006-890-392-959-339; 036-556-895-119-280; 040-806-887-128-56X; 043-588-084-654-159; 057-315-690-240-436; 067-441-989-453-225; 068-103-192-817-030; 082-148-699-990-795; 096-888-545-065-304; 097-598-856-805-905; 125-692-994-735-145; 131-816-213-370-905,131

They are currently produced under three management systems that involve different aspects of soil and pest management, productivity, and crop economy: organic, (integrated pest management-IPM), and conventional. Here, we studied how these systems affect the spiders, the natural enemies of olive grove pests, and performed a detailed analysis of their assemblage. The study was performed during one season in 18 olive groves in Andalusia, Spain, and included both ground-dwelling and canopy species. We found that the organic system supported a significantly higher level of abundance and diversity of canopy spiders than the IPM and conventional systems. Plowing had a negative effect on spider abundance and diversity. However, the presence of hedge vegetation had a positive effect on the spiders. The practices affected the guild structure differently, with some guilds supported by organic and others by IPM. It is suggested that sustainability (in terms of pest control) in olive grove agroecosystems may be obtained by maintaining hedge vegetation regardless of the management system.",44,3,509,518,Canopy; Organic farming; Integrated pest management; Biodiversity; Vegetation; PEST analysis; Pest control; Agroforestry; Guild; Biology,Araneae; abundance; farming practice; guild; olive grove,Agriculture/methods; Animals; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Olea; Pest Control/methods; Spain; Spiders,,,https://www.muni.cz/vyzkum/publikace/1331396 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26313956 http://ee.oxfordjournals.org/content/ee/44/3/509.full.pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26313956 https://academic.oup.com/ee/article-abstract/44/3/509/2464890 https://bioone.org/journals/Environmental-Entomology/volume-44/issue-3/nvv030/The-Spider-Assemblage-of-Olive-Groves-Under-Three-Management-Systems/10.1093/ee/nvv030.full https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153251155 https://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.1093/ee/nvv030,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvv030,26313956,10.1093/ee/nvv030,1968669156,,0,001-877-040-604-093; 004-834-764-137-338; 008-358-960-989-758; 010-231-777-114-797; 012-209-206-186-684; 013-383-194-199-92X; 013-786-883-470-427; 017-516-181-294-137; 018-066-035-157-047; 019-071-314-397-337; 021-495-377-094-561; 028-750-905-062-628; 032-968-239-256-418; 036-421-389-851-534; 037-096-110-134-969; 039-835-074-890-597; 041-251-922-025-049; 047-530-935-305-795; 054-512-600-971-213; 056-234-649-428-866; 056-585-869-238-25X; 057-898-374-057-282; 061-741-516-666-69X; 061-900-944-073-124; 068-202-545-290-160; 077-532-222-012-842; 078-348-747-534-519; 079-153-607-403-468; 079-190-354-875-952; 091-274-091-252-00X; 102-027-062-375-720; 111-383-017-128-517; 114-385-239-299-862; 118-373-445-433-062; 125-107-781-556-450; 137-637-923-794-571; 140-346-515-601-003; 146-289-648-784-886; 146-780-501-305-019; 155-933-298-887-367; 196-256-734-058-760,16

Morris; Mark J. Whittingham; Richard B. Bradbury; Jeremy D. Wilson; Antonios Kyrkos; David L. Buckingham; A. D. Evans,"Fine-scale habitat use by yellowhammers (Emberiza citrinella) searching for food to provision nestlings was compared in three agriculturally contrasting regions of lowland England. Log-linear modelling was used to test for significant overall variation in habitat use and significant differences in relative use between pairs of habitats. Yellowhammers provisioned nestlings non-randomly with respect to habitat availability. Habitat selection was found to be generally consistent across the three regions; field boundary structures and barley crops were the most selected foraging habitats, while intensively-managed grass fields were avoided relative to virtually all other habitats. The observed patterns of habitat selection are likely to result from an interaction of food abundance and varying accessibility to food, mediated by sward structure. The geographical generality of the results allows reasons to be suggested for the recent rapid population decline of the species and general conservation recommendations to be made with respect to lowland farmland.",101,2,197,210,Seasonal breeder; Organic farming; Foraging; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Emberizidae; Population decline; Emberiza citrinella; Abundance (ecology),,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320701000672 https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/25408 https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/25408 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320701000672,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0006-3207(01)00067-2,,10.1016/s0006-3207(01)00067-2,2132989391,,0,004-010-787-386-28X; 005-534-921-726-171; 013-709-724-948-295; 014-373-326-060-805; 014-836-735-608-163; 015-198-673-520-248; 020-167-621-399-502; 021-566-155-980-993; 022-070-333-305-083; 022-543-370-480-267; 023-768-767-589-379; 027-373-461-828-428; 029-568-331-038-13X; 030-831-977-852-027; 031-206-874-111-261; 034-367-146-530-261; 034-922-021-577-840; 038-445-105-507-360; 039-755-367-683-671; 042-361-149-826-87X; 043-155-766-199-743; 043-698-760-044-258; 044-379-480-034-205; 046-007-253-381-86X; 049-977-293-677-848; 055-972-794-412-906; 062-153-336-512-189; 063-003-550-683-547; 073-935-983-022-480; 087-186-786-234-321; 092-595-088-242-701; 093-835-124-539-323; 094-746-201-098-704; 096-009-544-840-942; 102-682-387-421-626; 102-860-044-759-667; 114-480-653-531-829; 120-514-812-606-235; 120-604-030-739-18X; 121-383-641-405-47X; 125-995-631-935-63X; 131-508-903-583-735; 137-390-747-094-792; 139-256-488-316-72X; 143-273-453-722-006; 145-653-851-729-665; 150-494-637-604-381; 156-066-906-763-397; 165-804-108-473-473; 167-246-603-611-22X; 176-314-956-781-732; 177-065-972-610-361,88

Renwick; Xavier Lambin,"Theory suggests that habitat fragmentation should reduce the risk of being parasitised due to reduced size and increased isolation of the host population. It is predicted that a threshold host population size exists, below which parasites will not be able to persist. Small mammals were trapped and their ecto-parasites removed in 14 field margins of varying widths over 2 years in a highly fragmented agro-ecosystem. No evidence to suggest the presence of a threshold in parasite prevalence was found, which may be due to the high rate of host movement and transiency within the system. Contrary to expectation, the probability of infestation decreased with host abundance and the abundance of alternative hosts, suggesting a dilution effect. The relatively long life cycle of small mammal specialist tick and flea species present under the prevailing environmental conditions may have left the parasites unable to keep up with the rate of reproduction and dispersal of the host. It is important to consider changes in the behaviour of the host and the presence of alternative hosts when predicting the effects of habitat fragmentation on disease spread.",43,1,27,35,Habitat fragmentation; Host (biology); Population size; Ecology; Infestation; Population; Biological dispersal; Habitat destruction; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,Animals; Ecosystem; Female; Host-Parasite Interactions; Male; Mammals; Population Density; Prevalence; Tick Infestations/epidemiology,,,https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/host-parasite-interactions-in-a-fragmented-landscape https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020751912002755 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23160021/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23160021 https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:293234 https://core.ac.uk/display/15155948 https://www.scilit.net/article/2011a37a39e7d0492a048784a644104c?action=show-references,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2012.10.012,23160021,10.1016/j.ijpara.2012.10.012,2041262929,,0,001-555-373-960-238; 001-580-811-130-416; 001-950-312-235-999; 002-201-206-643-452; 007-132-971-239-137; 008-434-385-362-001; 010-779-928-833-531; 011-857-803-112-092; 012-010-101-268-431; 012-624-627-717-285; 014-261-134-381-94X; 015-130-533-995-603; 015-134-261-084-547; 016-025-054-963-569; 016-415-191-953-627; 016-849-505-422-692; 017-182-838-010-497; 019-969-066-689-197; 021-551-052-719-440; 023-445-516-113-273; 024-676-040-049-468; 027-645-837-217-614; 031-095-200-071-532; 031-743-587-249-982; 036-906-751-128-425; 038-128-419-050-376; 041-270-760-602-272; 041-368-192-441-946; 043-188-836-873-440; 045-127-961-612-622; 046-062-516-918-449; 049-797-143-512-935; 050-925-719-623-371; 051-592-257-802-482; 060-103-182-964-829; 066-241-699-454-77X; 069-544-969-653-224; 072-482-751-637-173; 077-834-219-997-306; 085-544-336-235-583; 085-982-299-961-42X; 094-491-600-366-321; 097-015-798-679-455; 102-189-873-198-352; 105-094-544-172-394; 110-060-005-647-501; 125-615-739-713-10X; 127-417-878-353-779; 144-463-043-294-25X; 160-548-936-990-669; 174-354-673-761-68X; 187-804-615-602-979,15

Hawkes,"Members of various groups of insects, including weak fliers such as Cecidomyiidae and stronger flying Staphylinidae, accumulate on the leeward side of artificial and natural windbreaks (e.g. Lewis 1965, 1969, 1970; Lewis & Stephenson 1966). Many factors affect this accumulation, including the height and permeability of windbreaks and the wind speed, but it has been suggested (Lewis & Dibley 1970) that insects accumulate because they are carried on the wind and are caught in the turbulent circulating air mass to the leeward of the windbreaks. Hawkes (1 972a) showed that adult Erioischia brassicae accumulated at hedges and this behaviour was associated with feeding from hedgerow flowers. There was a diurnal population movement of flies between hedges and a brassica crop and this appeared to be incompatible with accumulation at windbreaks as a result of the insects being carried on the wind. This paper describes experiments to observe whether wind causes aggregation of E. brassicae at natural hedges and at a lath barrier representing an artificial windbreak.",10,3,695,,Crop; Windbreak; Brassica; Cecidomyiidae; Population; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/2401863,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2401863,,10.2307/2401863,2321741195,,0,008-134-796-200-707; 009-131-980-203-695; 019-513-327-104-471; 020-314-683-425-072; 023-487-127-123-633; 044-059-709-481-060; 051-277-774-568-401; 057-597-475-456-662; 080-390-014-852-73X; 083-657-812-223-339; 118-564-840-451-860; 126-223-834-027-654,21

Syversen,"Vegetative buffer zones adjacent to watercourses can be effective filters for diffuse pollution from agriculture. Several investigations, even during snowmelt season, have shown that retention of sediments and sediment-bound nutrients in runoff water has been high through buffer zones (BZ). It is likely that BZ also can be effective filters for sediment-bound pesticides. The retention of glyphosate, propiconazole, fenpropimorph and soil particles was studied in surface runoff experiments with 5 m wide buffer zones. Volume proportional samples were collected after each runoff episode (1999–2002). The distribution coefficient (K d ) shows moderate to high adsorption of the pesticides to the experimental soil. Results show average retention efficiency of about 51%, 48%, 85% and 34% for particles, glyphosate, propiconazole and fenpropimorph, respectively. The amount of AMPA (which is a degradation product of glyphosate), entering the BZ was high; approximately the same amount as for glyphosate. The retention efficiency through the BZ for AMPA was about 67%. There were no significant differences in removal efficiency (in %) between winter with snowmelt and summer. This is possibly due to detachment of coarser aggregates during winter, which trap more easily in the BZ. The conclusion based on this study suggests BZ to be contributors to reduced pesticide input to surface waters.",51,3-4,63,71,Environmental chemistry; Nutrient; Pesticide; Snow; Propiconazole; Fenpropimorph; Glyphosate; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Snowmelt,,"Adsorption; Cold Climate; Glycine/analogs & derivatives; Morpholines/analysis; Norway; Particle Size; Pesticides/analysis; Rain; Seasons; Snow; Triazoles/analysis; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis","Morpholines; Pesticides; Triazoles; Water Pollutants, Chemical; propiconazole; fenpropimorph; glyphosate; Glycine",,https://www.ucd.ie/dipcon/docs/theme03/theme03_03.PDF https://iwaponline.com/wst/article/51/3-4/63/11870/Cold-climate-vegetative-buffer-zones-as-pesticide https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15850175 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15850175/ http://www.ucd.ie/dipcon/docs/theme03/theme03_03.PDF,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2005.0576,15850175,10.2166/wst.2005.0576,1559383406,,0,002-024-929-973-119; 012-827-788-153-02X; 018-668-638-487-019; 028-797-840-578-786; 040-935-957-450-37X; 046-328-179-124-853; 068-432-148-221-069; 076-826-572-086-275; 088-236-621-248-724; 096-396-465-906-926; 123-547-078-308-929; 157-154-555-088-823; 167-013-613-510-038; 176-541-559-745-818,23

Effective landscape man-; agement for functionally important organisms suffers from little understanding of organism; spillover between semi-natural habitats and adjacent crops, and of how it is affected by the; surrounding landscape.; 2.; We examined syrphid abundance (Diptera: Syrphidae) in three types of linear semi-natural; habitats, differing in connectedness to annual crops and forest [forest edges (; n; = 12), forest-; connected hedges (; n; = 11) and isolated hedges (; n; = 12)], as well as in the adjacent oilseed; rape or winter wheat fields (i.e. altogether; n; = 70 sites in 35 landscapes). The landscape cir-; cles with 1 km radius around the study sites differed in the proportion of oilseed rape (rang-; ing from 0% to 35% oilseed rape) enabling us to test landscape-scale effects of oilseed rape.; 3.; Aphidophagous syrphids were more abundant in forest-connected hedgerows than in for-; est edges (with isolated hedges being intermediate), and more abundant in crop fields adjacent; to hedgerows than adjacent to forest edges, indicating spillover from semi-natural habitats to; the adjacent crop fields. Aphidophagous syrphid abundance was higher in semi-natural habi-; tats adjacent to oilseed rape fields than adjacent to wheat fields if the proportion of oilseed; rape in the landscape was low (indicating local concentration).; 4.; Synthesis and applications.; This study highlights the potential of hedgerows to enhance the; abundances of beneficial syrphids and their spillover to adjacent crop fields, especially when they; are connected with forests.

Fisher; X. Liu; Matthew E. Baker,"Riparian buffers contribute to the mitigation of nutrient pollution in agricultural landscapes, but there is concern regarding their potential to be hot spots of greenhouse gas production. This study compared soil CO and CH fluxes in adjacent crop fields and riparian buffers (a flood-prone forest and a flood-protected grassland along an incised channel) and examined the impact of water table depth (WTD) and flood events on the variability of gas fluxes in riparian zones. Results showed significantly ( 22°C), but the effect of flooding was less pronounced in early spring (emission <1.06 mg CH-C m d), probably due to low soil temperature. Although CH flux direction alternated at all sites, overall the croplands and the flood-affected riparian forest were CH sources, with annual emission averaging +0.04 ± 0.17 and +0.92 ± 1.6 kg CH-C ha, respectively. In the riparian forest, a topographic depression (<8% of the total area) accounted for 78% of the annual CH emission, underscoring the significance of landscape heterogeneity on CH dynamics in riparian buffers. The nonflooded riparian grassland, however, was a net CH sink (-1.08 ± 0.22 kg CH-C ha yr), probably due to the presence of subsurface tile drains and a dredged/incised channel at that study site. Although these hydrological alterations may have contributed to improvement in the CH sink strength of the riparian grassland, this must be weighed against the water quality maintenance functions and other ecological services provided by riparian buffers.",44,4,1080,1090,Riparian zone; Sink (geography); Riparian forest; Grassland; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science; Water table; Carbon dioxide; Nutrient pollution,,,,USDA-NRI,https://core.ac.uk/display/46962431 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153256490 https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/bitstream/handle/1805/8815/Jacinthe_2015_soil.pdf;sequence=1 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26437089 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2015.01.0014 https://core.ac.uk/download/46962431.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2015.01.0014,26437089,10.2134/jeq2015.01.0014,2301312742,,0,005-717-479-859-431; 005-962-609-880-191; 008-532-315-751-799; 010-825-594-370-024; 012-993-339-591-079; 015-008-874-237-705; 015-404-476-750-989; 017-790-054-259-381; 018-537-849-154-88X; 021-359-436-515-957; 022-064-279-785-010; 023-204-644-373-953; 023-775-979-865-14X; 031-205-549-990-210; 031-751-362-115-246; 036-491-024-054-704; 037-639-416-814-607; 038-981-667-377-771; 039-417-821-306-699; 040-229-676-588-390; 042-205-900-305-006; 042-220-297-354-721; 042-795-753-132-418; 043-549-884-739-378; 044-137-864-482-195; 045-020-182-383-672; 046-764-009-364-29X; 048-446-908-175-408; 053-216-524-633-913; 068-308-610-693-130; 071-594-172-075-364; 077-977-837-585-833; 086-372-682-617-945; 096-597-214-574-569; 099-748-767-096-16X; 099-853-803-503-629; 102-448-954-981-166; 103-515-858-247-125; 105-272-778-050-495; 111-606-443-415-864; 135-709-423-043-015; 138-021-921-262-257; 157-562-467-885-710; 177-904-011-066-242,27

Evans; L. Wes Burger; Samuel K. Riffell; Mark D. Smith,"Mounting evidence of wildlife population gains from targeted conservation practices has prompted the need to develop and evaluate practices that are integrated into production agriculture systems and targeted toward specific habitat objectives. However, effectiveness of targeted conservation actions across broader landscapes is poorly understood. We evaluated multiregion, multispecies avian densities on row-crop fields with native grass field margins (i.e., buffers) as part of the first U.S. agricultural conservation practice designed to support habitat and population recovery objectives of a national wildlife conservation initiative. We coordinated breeding season point transect surveys for 6 grassland bird species on 1151 row-crop fields with and without native grass buffers (9-37 m) in 14 U.S. states (10 ecoregions) from 2006 to 2011. In most regions, breeding season densities of 5 of 6 targeted bird species were greater in the 500-m surrounding survey points centered on fields with native grass buffers than in landscapes without buffers. Relative effect sizes were greatest for Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), Dickcissel (Spiza americana), and Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla) in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley and Eastern Tallgrass Prairie regions. Other species (e.g., Eastern Meadowlark [Sturnella magna], Grasshopper Sparrow [Ammodramus savannarum]) exhibited inconsistent relative effect sizes. Bird densities on fields with and without buffers were greatest in the Central Mixed-grass Prairie region. Our results suggest that strategic use of conservation buffers in regions with the greatest potential for relative density increases in target species will elicit greater range-wide population response than diffuse, uninformed, and broadly distributed implementation of buffers. We recommend integrating multiple conservation practices in broader agricultural landscapes to maximize conservation effectiveness for a larger suite of species.",28,4,892,901,Conservation agriculture; Wildlife conservation; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Meadowlark; Sparrow; Spizella; Population; Wildlife; Agroforestry,Colinus virginianus; Northern Bobwhite; agricultural conservation; amortiguadores de conservación; aves de pastizal; conservación agrícola; conservación objetivo; conservation buffers; grassland birds; monitoreo; monitoring; targeted conservation,Agriculture/legislation & jurisprudence; Animals; Birds/physiology; Conservation of Natural Resources; Grassland; Population Dynamics; Seasons; United States,,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,http://www.cavs.msstate.edu/publications/docs/2014/04/12438Evansetal2014_Assessing_Multiregion_avian_benefits_from_stratefically_targeted_agricultural_buffers_earlyview.pdf https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.12311 https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.12311 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24779636/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779636 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12311/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.12311,24779636,10.1111/cobi.12311,2171632917,,0,006-866-792-170-310; 007-345-255-242-473; 008-225-619-668-580; 012-737-200-927-794; 017-298-227-855-778; 018-660-321-983-843; 019-181-477-415-517; 019-552-010-845-927; 019-622-915-734-27X; 024-824-718-500-315; 025-701-778-467-146; 027-786-472-488-313; 034-350-057-263-068; 034-379-611-675-940; 034-456-136-124-424; 035-607-041-295-847; 040-618-665-169-421; 042-082-544-198-293; 045-455-587-148-315; 048-841-915-674-723; 050-261-844-716-21X; 051-685-596-945-405; 055-518-211-938-261; 059-693-318-258-980; 061-472-431-665-855; 061-939-471-831-666; 071-039-306-543-053; 073-990-815-488-726; 095-455-937-190-024; 102-694-489-949-18X; 109-329-959-515-650; 109-448-917-217-200; 113-020-887-836-867; 115-123-313-615-824; 120-993-169-075-447; 121-945-778-163-805; 124-319-214-482-940; 133-199-519-838-349; 136-446-153-249-957; 176-218-987-199-331,17

Cole; Ruth Morton; William Harrison; David I. McCracken; D Robertson,"The use of riparian buffer strips as a means of reducing diffuse pollution in European grassland systems is becoming more common and consequently there is a need for comprehensive research on the influence of buffer strip management, placement and structure on biodiversity. Carabid assemblages were examined in a range of riparian zones in intensively managed grassland in Scotland. Carabids were monitored by pitfall trapping in riparian zones open to grazing, wide riparian buffer strips (>5 m wide), narrow boundary strips (<2 m wide) and adjacent fields in order to determine factors influencing carabid diversity and assemblage structure. While carabid diversity was greater in open riparian zones and narrow boundary strips when compared to the adjacent fields, it was actually poorer in wide riparian buffers when compared to open zones thus indicating wide buffers may actually be detrimental to carabid diversity. Carabid assemblages in wide riparian buffers were, however, more distinct from the adjacent field than narrow boundary strips or riparian zones open to grazing. Consequently, while the presence of wide riparian buffers may not promote carabid diversity within the actual buffer strips, by adding an additional habitat that supports a distinct carabid assemblage, riparian buffer strips may promote diversity at the landscape level. Carabid assemblage structure was driven by a combination of soil and vegetation characteristics in addition to physical attributes including distance from the watercourse and width of the strip. Only when we have a better understanding of the factors influencing biodiversity within riparian buffer strips can we start to formulate effective management prescriptions that fuse their dual function of pollution mitigation and biodiversity promotion.",17,9,2233,2245,Riparian zone; Biodiversity; Vegetation; Habitat; Ecology; Grassland; Riparian buffer; Grazing; Environmental science; Buffer strip,,,,,https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10531-007-9304-1 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-007-9304-1 https://pure.sruc.ac.uk/en/publications/the-influence-of-riparian-buffer-strips-on-carabid-beetle-coleopt,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-007-9304-1,,10.1007/s10531-007-9304-1,1974543422,,0,000-669-594-539-024; 002-840-565-989-288; 004-010-787-386-28X; 007-243-303-723-240; 010-005-782-767-308; 011-749-985-776-165; 012-103-305-523-767; 012-335-108-074-344; 014-809-297-009-430; 018-426-147-707-10X; 020-024-935-817-641; 027-778-634-537-983; 029-067-159-542-004; 029-264-530-643-997; 042-303-914-852-499; 042-765-344-128-744; 044-050-646-677-718; 047-711-433-977-172; 050-261-844-716-21X; 056-789-845-462-569; 058-743-931-737-265; 059-258-894-353-584; 060-626-812-234-007; 063-424-164-316-197; 064-338-086-975-394; 073-021-383-708-605; 075-781-408-578-136; 077-918-560-780-184; 088-263-118-412-092; 090-479-535-234-324; 100-101-071-041-044; 108-396-753-252-799; 109-332-821-353-318; 117-345-687-903-78X; 122-159-545-592-770; 123-195-638-496-459; 128-236-973-422-860; 129-795-413-211-042; 130-751-762-460-611; 134-921-760-522-115; 154-386-144-197-99X; 164-502-760-111-254; 170-230-483-322-002; 176-100-710-487-88X; 185-374-982-166-638; 186-464-257-554-721; 188-364-361-504-243; 188-597-703-306-560,14

Bradbury; Antonios Kyrkos; Antony J. Morris; Stéphanie C. Clark; Allan J. Perkins; Jeremy D. Wilson,"1. Yellowhammers began to decline on British lowland farmland in the late 1980s and losses are presently 10% per year. This study examined variation in the habitat selection and breeding success of yellowhammers, allowing an evaluation of whether Britain's yellowhammer decline might have been caused by recent changes in agriculture.; ; ; ; 2. Yellowhammer territories were associated with hedgerows, vegetated ditches and wide uncultivated grassy margins around fields. Pasture and silage leys were avoided. Nests were built among herbaceous vegetation in ditches or in the shrubby vegetation of hedgerows.; ; ; ; 3. Breeding started slightly earlier on organic farms than on intensively managed farms, but no measure of breeding success differed between farm types. Predation was the cause of most (64%) nest failures. A maximum of three breeding attempts (two successful) was observed per pair, with a mean clutch size of 3·3, a Mayfield nest success rate of 0·46, and 2·6 nestlings fledged per successful brood. These data, together with published estimates of adult yellowhammer survival and of post-fledging survival among other passerines, suggest that breeding productivity is too low to maintain a stable population.; ; ; ; 4. The removal of hedgerows or abandonment of hedge management, filling or clearing of ditches, intensification of grassland management and cropping or grazing right up to the field edge, are all likely to have adversely affected yellowhammers on lowland farmland in southern England. Policy reforms that redirect subsidy support to environmentally beneficial management of field margin habitats and retention of winter-feeding sites such as stubbles should assist in restoring populations of breeding yellowhammers on lowland farmland.; ; ; ; 5. Our data expand further the array of farmland bird species for which interactions between agricultural change and population change are increasingly understood.",37,5,789,805,Wildlife conservation; Nest; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Population decline; Population; Yellowhammer; Agricultural land; Agroforestry; Avian clutch size,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20003021758 http://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND22299421 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/1500265 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00552.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00552.x/abstract https://www.jstor.org/stable/2655926,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00552.x,,10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00552.x,2042760506,,0,000-925-852-080-712; 002-234-862-186-238; 004-010-787-386-28X; 004-367-332-738-009; 005-794-740-211-807; 011-030-257-691-668; 011-305-198-094-715; 013-241-428-536-287; 013-709-724-948-295; 014-373-326-060-805; 017-190-183-029-313; 020-831-220-848-824; 022-257-102-279-260; 031-010-458-695-38X; 031-432-792-937-823; 032-245-730-539-873; 034-922-021-577-840; 040-889-337-784-868; 042-747-435-528-533; 043-698-760-044-258; 044-379-480-034-205; 049-977-293-677-848; 050-053-818-898-383; 054-572-651-357-154; 055-845-895-107-060; 056-621-864-838-091; 061-720-549-016-471; 065-941-754-623-005; 070-546-436-121-270; 071-601-656-233-384; 071-720-382-141-598; 072-224-176-896-782; 072-579-774-021-444; 073-935-983-022-480; 079-168-551-130-991; 094-746-201-098-704; 100-247-535-219-245; 102-660-243-361-006; 120-467-101-353-965; 120-514-812-606-235; 122-021-342-537-614; 131-249-817-715-208; 138-864-654-742-242; 145-653-851-729-665; 156-066-906-763-397; 156-445-426-110-493; 167-246-603-611-22X; 187-590-829-629-05X; 189-842-988-530-883; 196-154-013-303-271; 197-455-229-230-986,164

Staley; James M. Bullock; Katherine C. R. Baldock; John W. Redhead; Danny A. P. Hooftman; Nick Button; Richard F. Pywell,"Abstract Hedgerows provide key habitat and refuges for wildlife in otherwise intensively-managed landscapes, and may play a role in connecting increasingly fragmented habitats. However, the processes governing changes to the floral biodiversity of hedges are poorly understood. We analysed a unique, long-term data set of plant species richness over a 70 year period at 357 hedgerow sites in southern England to quantify changes in α, β and γ diversity, and identify the role of hedge management and other possible drivers of change. Alpha diversity increased in hedgerows, while a reduction in β diversity was indicated by taxonomic homogenisation, whereby previously distinct communities of species become more similar to one another over time. Changes in the regional species pool (γ diversity) differed with plant life-history; it increased for woody species but decreased among herbaceous hedge species. Hedgerow communities shifted towards species associated with higher soil fertility, a more competitive ecological strategy and, in unmanaged hedgerows, greater shade tolerance. Probable drivers for these changes include the move from traditional forms of management such as coppicing and hedge-laying towards either no management or frequent cutting with a mechanical flail, and eutrophication. The extent of changes in plant diversity over time was determined by both historical and recent hedgerow management, but these management effects varied with plant life-history attributes. However, changes in hedge quality and floral diversity were not linked directly to a 60% increase in the proportion of land use categories classified as ‘intensive’ adjacent to the sites over the 70 years. Recommendations are made for future hedgerow management based on conservation objectives for specific groups of hedge plant species.",167,,97,105,Biodiversity; Shade tolerance; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Alpha diversity; Metacommunity; Wildlife; Gamma diversity; Species richness; Agroforestry,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320713002656 https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/publications/changes-in-hedgerow-floral-diversity-over-70-years-in-an-english-rural-landscape-and-the-impacts-of-management(78a5d2a3-ddc9-4f4a-b906-e81ef4b53b55)/export.html https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/changes-in-hedgerow-floral-diversity-over-70-years-in-an-english-rural-landscape-and-the-impacts-of-management(78a5d2a3-ddc9-4f4a-b906-e81ef4b53b55)/export.html https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/changes-in-hedgerow-floral-diversity-over-70-years-in-an-english- http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320713002656 https://researchportal.northumbria.ac.uk/en/publications/changes-in-hedgerow-floral-diversity-over-70-years-in-an-english- https://core.ac.uk/display/16748888 https://core.ac.uk/download/16748888.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2013.07.033,,10.1016/j.biocon.2013.07.033,2040536532,,0,000-028-962-557-075; 000-103-713-547-965; 000-890-614-606-582; 004-077-015-560-416; 007-942-930-508-462; 009-263-421-936-141; 010-294-149-771-794; 014-096-501-205-686; 014-145-642-775-779; 018-023-127-841-209; 021-284-700-329-624; 022-918-260-400-877; 025-009-993-658-497; 032-349-893-284-226; 032-871-758-758-355; 040-939-848-637-483; 041-490-000-523-963; 045-479-005-785-688; 048-645-355-661-415; 051-293-738-345-112; 056-853-001-254-085; 063-141-893-182-571; 063-617-276-329-073; 065-793-977-594-676; 078-173-167-973-150; 081-816-033-871-022; 082-410-219-435-911; 084-101-049-675-878; 088-707-875-136-173; 092-228-898-297-400; 114-448-510-379-073; 124-772-634-450-262; 149-426-073-095-189; 150-325-162-873-23X; 154-750-119-428-838; 154-978-657-665-321; 156-624-196-949-616; 164-384-646-898-095; 176-160-239-279-783,31

The results of the study indicated food supply to be important for both predator species during the winter period, although the role of biotic factors in site selection in the autumn could not be clearly demonstrated. The winter distribution of the two species could, however, be explained well in terms of abiotic factors.

A study was performed to evaluate the effect of floristic diversity, vegetation patterns, and landscape structural connectivity on butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea and Hesperiidae), carabids (Coleoptera: Carabidae), syrphids (Diptera: Syrphidae), and sawflies (Hymenoptera: Symphyta). Vegetation analysis and insect samplings were carried out in nine sites within an intensively farmed landscape in northern Italy. Plant species richness and the percentage of tree, shrub, and herb cover were determined by means of the phytosociological method of Braun-Blanquet. Landscape structural connectivity was measured as the total length of hedgerow network (LHN) in a radius of 500 m around the center of each sampling transect. Butterflies species richness and abundance were positively associated both to herb cover and to plant species richness, but responded negatively to tree and shrub cover. Shrub cover was strictly correlated to both species richness and activity density of carabids. The species richness of syrphids was positively influenced by herb cover and plant richness, whereas their abundance was dependent on ligneous vegetation and LHN. Rarefaction analysis revealed that sawfly sampling was not robust and no relationship could be drawn with either vegetation parameters or structural connectivity.

The influence of habitat parameters (vegetation cover, fine sand content, organic matter, pH, soil pore volume, surrounding landscape structure, habitat area) on the staphylinid and carabid assemblages based on the number of individuals per species and site was analysed using canonical correspondence analysis. Vegetation cover was the most significant parameter significantly characterizing both staphylinid and carabid assemblages. The amount of vegetation cover explained 15.7% of the variance, fine sand content accounted for 13.3% and surrounding landscape structure for 10.9% of the variance in the staphylinid assemblage. In the carabid assemblage, vegetation cover was the only significant factor, explaining 24.7% of the variance. This study showed for the first time that the significance of wildflower areas as a reservoir for hibernation for generalist predatory beetles increases with progressing successional age.",94,3,209,217,Canonical correspondence analysis; Vegetation; Habitat; Ecology; Overwintering; Wildflower; Generalist and specialist species; Species richness; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,Animals; Arabidopsis/parasitology; Coleoptera/growth & development; Ecosystem; Female; Male; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Species Specificity; Switzerland; Time Factors; Triticum/parasitology,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15191622 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15191622/ https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0007485304000227 https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bulletin-of-entomological-research/article/staphylinidae-and-carabidae-overwintering-in-wheat-and-sown-wildflower-areas-of-different-age/4946903DF7FE2E4F8BFB377F1F12E6F4 https://boris.unibe.ch/115708/ https://core.ac.uk/download/343209400.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1079/ber2004301,15191622,10.1079/ber2004301,2152763101,,0,001-043-709-656-485; 006-160-831-631-796; 008-162-548-306-172; 012-267-243-122-028; 013-165-788-162-483; 013-270-209-241-22X; 013-526-378-431-354; 015-238-252-373-378; 018-174-584-116-166; 022-070-333-305-083; 026-969-752-606-914; 027-601-881-483-122; 029-264-530-643-997; 030-652-847-337-20X; 037-241-390-682-529; 039-839-177-684-866; 045-347-571-315-037; 047-468-541-247-970; 051-103-549-479-234; 053-832-610-795-117; 055-371-058-560-691; 056-892-041-411-85X; 058-105-561-757-413; 058-743-931-737-265; 062-818-859-072-622; 063-112-903-921-487; 064-338-086-975-394; 064-893-774-544-494; 067-715-519-706-692; 069-379-822-515-162; 076-355-879-729-476; 076-425-702-964-164; 076-729-975-056-738; 076-851-991-319-613; 078-272-079-532-367; 082-518-465-650-11X; 082-782-980-105-338; 086-419-085-554-996; 087-186-786-234-321; 093-275-781-286-407; 100-101-071-041-044; 106-466-422-683-648; 109-691-661-850-685; 111-528-391-156-029; 119-770-186-900-96X; 122-528-143-728-138; 132-569-724-005-273; 134-921-760-522-115; 142-547-556-180-595; 145-653-851-729-665; 149-431-649-896-445; 149-796-121-127-05X; 151-431-337-222-216; 184-517-351-816-672,75

Pywell; E. A. Warman; Lucy Hulmes; S. Hulmes; P. Nuttall; Tim H. Sparks; C.N.R. Critchley; A. Sherwood,"Intensive farming has contributed to the serious declines in abundance and geographic range suffered by several bumblebee species in Europe and North America. Recent UK agri-environmental policy aims to conserve and restore bumblebee populations by providing foraging habitats on arable field margins. We examined the effectiveness of strategies to achieve this, including sowing seed mixtures of (1) tussocky grass species, (2) wildflowers and (3) pollen- and nectar-rich plants. These were compared to conventionally managed cereal crops. Sampling was undertaken in 32 10 × 10 km squares throughout England, each containing a sample of the different field margin types. Bumblebee abundance in July and August was significantly higher on pollen and nectar margins (86 ± 14 bees per 100 m) compared with wildflower margins (43 ± 14), mature grass margins (6 ± 14) and recently sown grass margins (8 ± 4). Bees were virtually absent from the cereal crop (0.2 ± 0.1). Bumblebee species richness was significantly higher on margins sown with either wildflowers or the pollen and nectar mix. There was evidence that richness of the bumblebee assemblage at the 10 × 10 km square scale was positively correlated with land use heterogeneity, the proportion of grassland, and the abundance and richness of dicotyledon flowers. The abundance of long-tongued bees per margin was explained by the number of pollen and nectar agreements per 10 × 10 km square, together with flower abundance. Future research is required to determine the quantity and location of foraging habitat required to sustain bumblebee populations at the landscape scale.",129,2,192,206,Nectar; Foraging; Ecology; Apidae; Bumblebee; Wildflower; Pollen; Species richness; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320705004659 https://core.ac.uk/display/377693,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2005.10.034,,10.1016/j.biocon.2005.10.034,2106644367,,0,014-229-118-471-777; 017-465-919-368-503; 017-948-698-985-888; 027-159-836-996-448; 035-775-229-294-961; 035-993-763-187-90X; 038-844-627-956-858; 039-885-186-600-094; 046-004-550-166-441; 048-543-721-099-075; 050-907-802-597-89X; 052-425-505-697-799; 053-551-700-281-485; 056-585-869-238-25X; 056-789-845-462-569; 059-361-082-177-816; 061-091-986-780-807; 062-948-664-034-066; 064-975-099-130-640; 067-912-727-549-225; 068-452-604-669-157; 069-568-229-723-537; 069-901-245-663-534; 074-793-529-288-006; 079-068-774-342-74X; 080-164-660-083-693; 083-810-224-480-214; 092-858-515-334-988; 105-466-690-006-049; 106-138-748-871-574; 109-473-377-783-758; 112-917-317-852-89X; 114-016-061-618-278; 114-480-653-531-829; 117-345-687-903-78X; 149-426-073-095-189; 154-386-144-197-99X; 156-207-702-434-918; 165-420-840-117-725; 168-312-770-361-773; 184-061-655-286-989; 188-588-802-460-024,163

In this study, we investigated whether or not landscape characteristics affected the number of codling moths in commercial orchards. To do this, we collected overwintering larvae in 2006 and 2007 in 76 orchards over a 70 km² area in southeastern France. We analysed variations in the number of larvae using correlation tests and linear models. As independent variables, we took both characteristics of focus orchards (pear vs. apple, organic vs. conventional orchards) and of their surrounding landscape (orchard density and hedgerow network attributes) into account in buffers with widths varying from 50 to 500 m. Although the codling moth is specialised on orchards, the number of codling moths was lower in orchards within a high orchard density area. There was some indication that this effect was mostly due to the density of conventional orchards and thus to the intensity of insecticide treatments. Conversely, we found no particular effect of abandoned or organic orchards. In 2006, the number of codling moths was also significantly lower in a focus orchard when the hedgerow network acted as a protection against the prevailing wind. Finally, major effects of landscape variables on the number of codling moths were observed for distances of less than 150 m from the focus orchards, suggesting that codling moth management should be organised over areas of about 16 ha.",24,3,337,349,Organic farming; Integrated pest management; Ecology; Population density; Geography; PEST analysis; Overwintering; Codling moth; Tortricidae; Orchard; Agronomy,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-008-9308-6 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093064667 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20093064667.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10980-008-9308-6 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pierre_Franck/publication/225180724_The_influence_of_landscape_on_insect_pest_dynamics_A_case_study_in_southeastern_France/links/0fcfd50b625a454ab7000000.pdf https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301596465,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-008-9308-6,,10.1007/s10980-008-9308-6,2105552755,,0,002-515-531-907-513; 005-346-710-452-221; 006-278-530-116-460; 006-308-525-460-894; 007-260-320-632-29X; 007-564-661-930-546; 009-522-503-130-954; 010-162-524-522-227; 011-508-246-956-659; 017-516-181-294-137; 022-040-574-352-916; 024-860-530-135-158; 031-094-771-196-289; 031-114-644-626-51X; 032-376-829-956-335; 038-050-491-689-943; 040-930-611-597-523; 041-981-707-584-66X; 042-336-185-080-206; 043-922-856-983-819; 048-222-577-387-904; 050-580-947-928-66X; 056-892-630-404-500; 058-479-800-510-95X; 069-366-512-460-44X; 074-138-002-216-945; 075-210-767-428-43X; 077-532-222-012-842; 087-109-316-580-01X; 090-412-082-790-734; 094-515-841-908-877; 098-312-271-690-700; 102-602-517-987-677; 108-218-821-288-91X; 110-111-894-688-860; 127-460-078-837-613; 129-005-638-846-365; 130-698-554-759-854; 143-082-599-603-403; 151-393-676-185-507; 153-219-521-750-160; 156-624-196-949-616; 171-447-946-311-398; 176-506-367-701-104,96

Sparks,"1. An earlier paper related bird species richness to hedgerows and other field boundary attributes including adjacent land use. The study was over several years (winter and summer) at two sites, Huntingdon and Swavesey, in East Anglia UK. 2. The present paper deals with similar relationships, but the bird variables used are the abundance of individual species, of groups of species (all finches, all raptors, etc.) and of all birds, as well as Simpson's index of diversity. This required extensive modelling - 105 models for Huntingdon and 174 for Swavesey. 3. The results of all 279 models are presented in a condensed form, highlighting the importance of given field boundary attributes to particular species or groups of species. 4. Like bird species richness in the earlier paper, the abundance of many species was strongly influenced by the land use, and by the main vegetation variables (tree height and number, hedgerow length, height and width). Land use was important to a larger majority of species, the exceptions being carrion crow, pheasant, reed bunting and wren. 5. Verge width appeared important for small insectivores (blue tit) and was particularly important for seed eating birds, e.g. most finches and buntings, red-legged partridge in summer, and carrion crow and skylark in winter. 6. Ditch dimensions were associated with the abundance of some seed eaters (linnet, reed bunting and goldfinch) and insectivores (blackbird, great tit, skylark, song thrush and wren). Kestrel and the groups raptors, corvids, waders and aquatics were associated with large ditches. 7. Though the general management prescriptions to benefit the majority of farmland birds were found to be similar to those in the earlier paper, the detailed species specific modelling made it possible to examine the habitat requirements of particular species. 8. Ecological evaluation of the results from the two studies are presented in a form considered to be of value for practical management. Bird species and groups of birds are categorised with respect to their likely requirements of particular attributes of the field boundaries.",32,2,362,371,Vegetation; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Bunting; Kestrel; Population; Carrion crow; Species richness; Abundance (ecology),,,,,http://www.jstor.org/stable/2405102?origin=crossref http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=3533953 http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/30021983648,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2405102,,10.2307/2405102,2018071619,,0,002-234-862-186-238; 023-310-699-181-261; 029-904-475-177-008; 072-224-176-896-782; 084-605-487-121-903; 110-766-047-364-379; 196-154-013-303-271,119

Toth,"Abstract The general aim of ensuring a nearly natural environment and ecological plant protection needs deeper knowledge in the field of functional interactions between different habitats, which serve as general species reserves and, from an ecological plant protection point of view, as resources of beneficial arthropods as well as pests. In Hungary, specific conditions (large-scale farming and the presence of field margins) have provided the opportunity to study the importance of both fields and field margins as insect habitats through time and space. Large fields brought about a reduction of the effect on immigration or crossing of insects of field margins and neighbouring plant stands. Surveys have been conducted in a winter wheat field and in the weedy field margins. Pests, beneficial arthropods and other nontarget organisms were collected by using pitfall traps, by sweeping and by individual plant examination. Species of carabids, individual numbers of staphylinids, spiders, cantharids, coccinellids (predators), aphids and Oulema spp. (the most common winter wheat pests in Hungary) in the field margin and in the field are compared. Similarity and diversity values of carabids, and the distribution of cantharid adults and larvae are given, focusing on the different functions of the field margin and the field as habitats. Conclusions are given on the importance of these habitats for species preservation as well as for ecological pest management.",27,2-4,191,198,Agriculture; Integrated pest management; Larva; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Geography; Insect; Oulema; Distribution (economics),,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016920469390049J,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0169-2046(93)90049-j,,10.1016/0169-2046(93)90049-j,2050942202,,0,012-155-798-787-334; 041-047-966-691-424; 047-711-433-977-172; 047-898-549-829-481; 056-892-041-411-85X; 075-781-408-578-136; 095-683-426-011-666; 110-250-911-763-923,13

Collins; Crile Doscher; Hamish Gordon Rennie; James G. Ross,"In New Zealand, around half of the lowland water bodies do not meet water quality standards, primarily due to widespread changes in land use. Riparian restoration has been occurring in New Zealand for over 30 years in an effort to minimize this impact, however, little monitoring of restoration effectiveness has been undertaken. This study evaluated the impact of riparian plantings on water quality of lowland streams in the Lake Ellesmere catchment. A paired-catchment design on four river reaches was used to compare restored riparian buffers with control sites upstream. Chemical water quality sampling was used in conjunction with a macroinvertebrate community assessment. Equivocal benefits of riparian restoration were observed, with improvements in some variables but not in others. Riparian restoration had a positive effect on water quality in terms of increasing dissolved oxygen and decreasing turbidity. However, conductivity increased at planted sites and no changes were observed in other variables. These findings may be affected by the insufficient width of all four buffers, and gaps in the buffer system contributing to poor water quality. Although variable responses were seen in invertebrate community composition, this research suggests that even narrow planted buffer strips may be effective in improving some water quality parameters. The overall mixed results present a fair assessment of the benefits of riparian restoration that may be expected within a relatively short time following vegetation establishment. Even when no baseline data have been established prior to restoration, this research showed monitoring can demonstrate the effectiveness of riparian restoration.",21,1,40,48,Riparian zone; Drainage basin; Bank; Vegetation; Ecology; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science; STREAMS; Buffer strip; Restoration ecology,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20133077991 https://researcharchive.lincoln.ac.nz/handle/10182/7027 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2011.00859.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100x.2011.00859.x,,10.1111/j.1526-100x.2011.00859.x,2049097452,,0,010-125-338-512-655; 015-256-006-013-114; 035-520-814-340-709; 040-198-568-662-726; 046-995-738-381-709; 052-261-353-347-416; 054-370-205-436-017; 063-911-760-677-253; 076-883-996-010-013; 083-940-305-330-715; 103-117-865-379-894; 109-341-142-099-500; 116-392-527-740-93X; 124-362-212-566-546; 143-711-593-789-963; 151-299-405-770-332; 163-743-140-779-406; 165-628-054-746-738; 192-092-399-032-761,43

Thomas; N. W. Sotherton; D. S. Coombes; Steve D. Wratten,"Summary; ; The winter distributions of a range of polyphagous predators were investigated in relation to field boundary structure. The distribution of Demetrias atricapillus was significantly positively correlated with the density of cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata) tussocks, and Forficula auricularia and Tachyporus chrysomelinus were significantly positively correlated with percentage cover of deciduous leaf litter, However, although densities of predators varied significantly between field boundaries, no further relationships were identified to explain the observed predator distribution patterns.

Unger; Keith W. Goyne; Robert J. Kremer; Ann C. Kennedy,"Vegetative filter strips (VFS) have long been promoted as a soil conservation practice that yields many additional environmental benefits. Most previous studies have focused primarily on the role of vegetation and/or soil physical properties in these ecosystem services. Few studies have investigated the soil microbial community of VFS. Therefore, we examined potential differences in soil microbial community characteristics of claypan soil planted to VFS with differing vegetation and a traditional row-crop system in a maize–soybean rotation. Samples were tested for soil microbial function and community structure using dehydrogenase and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis enzyme assays and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, respectively. The grass VFS soil exhibited the greatest dehydrogenase activity levels and FDA activity was greater in the grass and agroforestry (i.e., tree–grass) VFS soils relative to the cropland soil. The PLFA analysis revealed community structural differences underlying these functional differences. The agroforestry VFS soil was characterized by a greater proportion of total bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, anaerobic bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi than the cropland soil. The grass VFS soil shared some characteristics with the cropland soils; but the grass VFS supported greater mycorrhizal fungi and protozoa populations. This work highlights differences in soil microbial function and community structure in VFS relative to cropland soil 12 years post VFS establishment. It also enhances our fundamental knowledge regarding soil microorganisms in VFS, which may aid in explaining some ecosystem services provided by VFS (e.g., decomposition of organic agrichemicals).",87,2,395,402,Soil conservation; Community structure; Soil classification; Soil water; Vegetation; Claypan; Anaerobic bacteria; Agroforestry; Agronomy; Microbial population biology; Biology,,,,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/567776 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20133136683 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-012-9559-8 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10457-012-9559-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-012-9559-8,,10.1007/s10457-012-9559-8,2003409784,,0,000-052-242-395-979; 008-022-401-426-845; 008-540-892-409-627; 013-786-600-612-318; 015-620-073-261-95X; 019-622-915-734-27X; 025-671-507-507-121; 032-335-181-753-808; 036-315-734-250-926; 038-659-320-814-260; 040-507-160-098-910; 044-623-657-378-698; 056-321-153-449-917; 056-504-435-726-187; 056-572-672-082-930; 066-372-522-135-263; 068-664-004-071-826; 074-509-767-045-244; 088-017-310-971-747; 092-410-436-114-594; 096-499-726-729-908; 100-679-216-297-456; 106-567-615-861-01X; 106-682-173-798-87X; 116-053-151-472-714; 116-998-278-181-490; 123-375-961-941-223; 127-017-046-440-009; 128-044-932-510-171; 133-138-314-955-26X; 134-549-967-701-964; 146-390-968-365-10X; 149-633-039-918-024; 150-985-547-313-819; 161-671-403-526-169; 171-625-550-339-318; 195-318-961-374-784,23

M. Homininck; B. R. Briscoe,"Soil from 403 hedgerow, roadside verge, woodland, heathland or field sites was assessed for presence of entomopathogenic rhabditid nematodes with aGalleria larva baiting technique. Steinernematids were recovered from 48 % of the sites but only one site yielded Heterorhabditis sp. The species recovered most frequently was Steinernema bibionis (Bovien). Another unidentified Steinernema sp. was also isolated. Prevalence of steinernematids in the different types of habitat formed continuum so that roadside verges harboured them most often while heathland sites yielded them least often. Mean soil temperatures at 5 cm were about 15 °C in fields and verges, 13 °C in hedgerows and heathland and 12 °C in woodland. Prevalence of the nematodes varied in different parts of Britain and was influenced by soil type. They were associated with calcareous soils, especially those with a calcareous subsoil horizon. Soils which are periodically or seasonally water-logged were suitable. Soils enriched by humus and hence high in organic matter frequently harboured the nematodes and some suitable soils had significant clay contents or subsoils high in clay. It appears that the two steinernematids are relatively unspecialized species, occurring in diverse habitats and soil types and are adapted to cooler temperatures.",100,2,295,302,Subsoil; Calcareous; Soil classification; Soil water; Soil type; Rhabditida; Organic matter; Humus; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19912304520 http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0031182000061308 https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/parasitology/article/occurrence-of-entomopathogenic-nematodes-rhabditida-steinernematidae-and-heterorhabditidae-in-british-soils/0C5E65308D86A2F19075D1F830925163 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19912304520.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0031182000061308,,10.1017/s0031182000061308,2168427323,,0,000-688-734-104-350; 002-328-129-453-388; 020-489-303-891-165; 027-841-708-549-741; 029-658-129-596-794; 032-404-572-767-963; 034-517-275-219-008; 034-568-700-711-854; 047-606-057-080-26X; 053-634-120-567-464; 064-294-993-896-268; 072-205-983-305-455; 079-278-776-257-966; 147-601-992-442-236; 172-486-971-609-864; 174-981-376-786-015,92

Gantzer; Stephen H. Anderson; E. E. Alberts; Allen L. Thompson,"Addition of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) barriers to vegetative filter strips (FS) shows potential as conservation practice. This study evaluates the comparative effectiveness of three conservation practices in reducing runoff, sediment, N, and P losses from 1.5- by 16-m plots on an Aeric Epiaqualf. Three practices compared are a traditional fescue (Festuca arundinacea) filter strip (Fescue-FS), a switchgrass barrier in combination with the Fescue-FS (B-Fescue-FS) and a switchgrass barrier in combination with a native grass and forbs species filter strip (B-Native-FS). This study also predicts transport of sediment, N, and P in Fescue-FS and B-Fescue-FS. Fescue-FS and B-Fescue-FS of equal widths (0.7 m) significantly reduced runoff and sediment transport as compared with a continuous cultivated fallow (CCF) treatment, but B-Fescue-FS was more effective for reducing runoff (p < 0.05) and sediment (p < 0.01) transport. B-Fescue-FS was also more effective than Fescue-FS for reducing losses of organic N, NO 3 -N, NH 4 -N, particulate P, and PO 4 -P (p < 0.01). Fescue-FS and B-Native-FS were equally effective for reducing runoff, sediment, and nutrient loss. Effectiveness of FS increased with distance with 18% of runoff, 92% of sediment, and 71% of nutrient leaving the source area being reduced in the first 4 m of the FS. An equation to predict sediment associated with runoff ponding above barriers explained approximately 70% of the variability between measured and predicted values of sediment, organic N, and particulate P transport. Combination of switchgrass barriers with FS is an effective alternative to Fescue-FS alone for reducing sediment and nutrients in runoff.",68,5,1670,1678,Nutrient; Festuca arundinacea; Panicum virgatum; Filter strip; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Phosphorus; Agronomy; Sediment transport,,,,Missouri Agric.

Wickens; David Kleijn,"Growing evidence for declines in wild bees calls for the development and implementation of effective mitigation measures. Enhancing floral resources is a widely accepted measure for promoting bees in agricultural landscapes, but effectiveness varies considerably between landscapes and regions. We hypothesize that this variation is mainly driven by a combination of the direct effects of measures on local floral resources and the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape. To test this, we established wildflower strips in four European countries, using the same seed mixture of forage plants specifically targeted at bees. We used a before-after control-impact approach to analyse the impacts of wildflower strips on bumblebees, solitary bees and Red List species and examined to what extent effects were affected by local and landscape-wide floral resource availability, land-use intensity and landscape complexity. Wildflower strips generally enhanced local bee abundance and richness, including Red-listed species. Effectiveness of the wildflower strips increased with the local contrast in flower richness created by the strips and furthermore depended on the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape, with different patterns for solitary bees and bumblebees. Effects on solitary bees appeared to decrease with increasing amount of late-season alternative floralresources in the landscape, whereas effects on bumblebees increased with increasing early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability.Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the effects of wildflower strips on bees are largely driven by the extent to which local flower richness is increased. The effectiveness of this measure could therefore be enhanced by maximizing the number of bee forage species in seed mixtures, and by management regimes that effectively maintain flower richness in the strips through the years. In addition, for bumblebees specifically, our study highlights the importance of a continuous supply of food resources throughout the season. Measures that enhance early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability, such as the cultivation of oilseed rape, can benefit bumblebees by providing the essential resources for colony establishment and growth in spring. Further research is required to determine whether, and under what conditions, wildflower strips result in actual population-level effects.

Amy; Matthew S. Heard; Susan E. Hartley; Charles George; Richard F. Pywell; Joanna T. Staley,"Hedgerows are an important semi-natural habitat for invertebrates and other wildlife within agricultural landscapes. Hedgerow quality can be greatly affected either by over- or under-management. Neglect of hedgerows is an increasingly important issue as traditional management techniques such as hedgelaying become economically unviable. In the UK, funding for hedge management is available under agri-environment schemes but relatively little is known about how this impacts on wider biodiversity. We used a randomised block experiment to investigate how habitat structural change, arising from a range of techniques to rejuvenate hedgerows (including more economic/mechanised alternatives to traditional hedgelaying), affected invertebrate abundance and diversity. We combined digital image analysis with estimates of foliage biomass and quality to show which aspects of hedge structure were most affected by the rejuvenation treatments. All investigated aspects of habitat structure varied considerably with management type, though the abundance of herbivores and predators was affected primarily by foliage density. Detritivore abundance was most strongly correlated with variation in hedge gap size. The results suggest that habitat structure is an important organising force in invertebrate community interactions and that management technique may affect trophic groups differently. Specifically we find that alternative methods of hedgerow rejuvenation could support abundances of invertebrates comparable or even higher than traditional hedgelaying, with positive implications for the restoration of a larger area of hedgerow habitat on a limited budget.",16,5,443,451,Biomass (ecology); Biodiversity; Dead hedge; Habitat; Ecology; Community; Herbivore; Agroforestry; Trophic level; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,DEFRA; NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179115000596 https://core.ac.uk/display/33452798 https://core.ac.uk/download/33452798.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2015.04.002,,10.1016/j.baae.2015.04.002,2060830412,,0,002-613-900-013-62X; 009-263-421-936-141; 009-737-636-338-028; 010-225-312-935-498; 016-454-058-212-274; 023-045-119-361-270; 024-743-924-814-572; 030-309-137-488-224; 034-662-603-831-951; 042-195-189-711-603; 042-765-530-097-726; 053-002-848-047-394; 057-283-401-649-275; 063-593-316-301-291; 065-315-870-907-728; 083-377-217-246-02X; 084-101-049-675-878; 084-893-330-370-820; 094-060-953-943-724; 097-095-789-567-42X; 101-401-792-322-920; 107-610-431-706-338; 113-711-894-515-431; 120-327-841-345-544; 123-531-564-917-678; 126-812-080-751-085; 128-892-311-920-110; 134-312-556-034-559; 149-250-414-297-242; 150-325-162-873-23X; 182-236-996-077-99X; 190-696-675-608-128,18

Stockan; John Baird; Simon J. Langan; Mark R. Young; Glenn R. Iason,"Current restoration of stream and lotic freshwater systems to ‘good ecological status’ has focused on the creation of vegetated riparian buffer strips. Yet, despite this constituting a major land-use change, surprisingly little is known about the effects of these strips on riparian organisms. We investigated the effect that widespread adoption of buffer strips may have on activity density, species diversity, and assemblage composition of ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae).; Over 2 years, we sampled carabids from 41 riparian margins within two river catchments in north-east Scotland. We compared three types of riparian margin: unbuffered (i.e. ‘unimproved’), vegetated buffer strips, and wooded, the latter acting as reference sites. A range of site parameters including characteristics of soil, water, and vegetation were recorded and the extent to which they correlated with ground beetle assemblages was explored.; Catchment and treatment effects were detected on ground beetle activity density and species diversity with unbuffered sites showing higher activity density and species richness. The assemblage structure differed according to catchment, treatment, and local characteristics. Multivariate analysis suggested that soil and vegetation parameters and stream width, together with buffer strip age and length were determinants of assemblage structure. Few riparian species were found in large numbers.; This study shows that in intensively managed agricultural landscapes riparian buffer strips do not create the quality of habitat required by truly riparian species. They do, however, provide habitat for woodland and stenotopic species and with more careful planning could play a role in increasing habitat heterogeneity at a landscape scale.",7,2,172,184,Riparian zone; Riparian forest; Spatial heterogeneity; Ecology; Ground beetle; Riparian buffer; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Species richness; Species diversity,,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/icad.12043/abstract https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/effects-of-riparian-buffer-strips-on-ground-beetles-coleoptera-ca https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/icad.12043,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.12043,,10.1111/icad.12043,2067928170,,0,002-530-530-966-98X; 003-923-174-913-77X; 005-723-292-558-146; 005-992-936-413-213; 010-641-095-905-737; 013-383-194-199-92X; 014-005-967-253-86X; 016-914-499-702-644; 017-469-124-239-298; 018-202-918-339-630; 020-977-743-298-966; 021-624-474-054-05X; 027-902-174-325-490; 030-766-878-238-058; 034-656-684-601-494; 040-368-185-209-915; 040-729-430-632-487; 045-954-410-963-492; 052-272-715-378-177; 056-585-869-238-25X; 056-789-845-462-569; 057-981-598-792-734; 058-950-840-663-346; 060-845-293-693-972; 061-077-750-719-523; 068-339-344-971-039; 071-315-338-889-428; 076-377-649-956-283; 078-118-343-936-884; 078-495-785-788-050; 079-394-505-248-847; 080-086-175-670-914; 083-113-612-315-815; 089-507-649-812-794; 092-151-348-850-74X; 093-485-123-537-134; 094-462-665-597-822; 098-207-763-384-799; 098-656-934-947-538; 102-953-179-487-171; 108-161-946-674-641; 114-772-538-209-249; 117-345-687-903-78X; 121-954-134-376-260; 126-051-201-417-566; 126-785-052-582-631; 140-104-328-176-871; 142-846-682-972-796; 146-310-759-962-001; 176-664-883-657-81X,19

Pywell,"Hedgerows provide important habitat and food resources for overwintering birds, mammals and invertebrates. Currently, 41% of managed hedgerow length in England forms part of three Agri-Environment Scheme (AES) options, which specify a reduction in hedgerow cutting frequency from the most common practice of annual cutting. These AES options aim to increase the availability of flowers and berries for wildlife, but there has been little rigorous testing of their efficacy or estimates of the magnitude of their effects. We conducted a factorial experiment on hawthorn hedges to test the effects of (i) cutting frequency (every 1, 2 or 3 years) and (ii) timing of cutting (autumn vs. winter) on the abundance of flowers and berry resources. Results from 5 years show that hedgerow cutting reduced the number of flowers by up to 75% and the biomass of berries available over winter by up to 83% compared to monitored uncut hedges. Reducing cutting frequency from every year to every 3 years resulted in 2.1 times more flowers and a 3.4 times greater berry mass over 5 years. Cutting every 2 years had an intermediate effect on flower and berry abundance, but the increase in biomass of berries depended on cutting in winter rather than autumn. The most popular AES option is cutting every 2 years (32% of English managed hedgerow length). If these hedges were managed under a 3 year cutting regime instead, we estimate that biomass of berries would increase by about 40%, resulting in a substantial benefit for wildlife.",145,1,24,29,Biomass (ecology); Resource (biology); Habitat; Ecology; Overwintering; Berry; Wildlife; Term (time); Agronomy; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,http://core.ac.uk/display/386519 https://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND44727133 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632071100351X https://researchportal.northumbria.ac.uk/en/publications/long-term-effects-of-hedgerow-management-policies-on-resource-pro http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632071100351X https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/publications/longterm-effects-of-hedgerow-management-policies-on-resource-provision-for-wildlife(88532c11-46b9-412b-95d1-06a8356eaf4a)/export.html https://core.ac.uk/download/386519.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2011.09.006,,10.1016/j.biocon.2011.09.006,2055149127,,0,002-234-862-186-238; 006-914-266-427-810; 009-104-527-591-059; 009-263-421-936-141; 017-809-891-881-618; 019-945-094-134-221; 021-633-765-840-397; 022-321-534-473-933; 041-679-397-425-833; 045-455-587-148-315; 050-757-034-746-213; 055-946-607-021-418; 063-759-902-586-32X; 065-346-869-208-139; 073-798-803-161-275; 092-256-195-118-777; 094-060-953-943-724; 120-514-812-606-235; 150-494-637-604-381; 156-624-196-949-616; 164-384-646-898-095; 165-194-609-436-974; 176-160-239-279-783; 190-696-675-608-128; 196-107-021-207-181,44

A field trial was conducted from 2007 to 2009 in north-east Italy in order to evaluate the effectiveness of various types of vegetative filter strips to reduce spring-summer runoff of the herbicides mesotrione, metolachlor and terbuthylazine, widely used in maize, and to evaluate the effect of the rainfall characteristics on the runoff volume and concentration. Results show that without vegetative filter strip the herbicide load that reaches the surface water is about 5–6 g ha −1  year −1 for metolachlor and terbuthylazine (i.e. 0.5–0.9% of the applied rate), confirming that runoff from flat fields as in the Po Valley can have a minor effect on the water quality, and that most of the risk is posed by a few, or even just one extreme rainfall event with a return period of about 25–27 years, causing runoff with a maximum concentration of 64–77 μg L −1 .

Schulte Moore; Thomas M. Isenhart; Richard C. Schultz,"In response to concern about the loss of ecosystem services once provided by natural riparian systems, state and federal agencies have established incentive programs for landowners to convert sensitive lands from agricultural to conservation uses. Enhancement of wildlife habitat, while identified as a function of such systems, has often been of secondary importance to soil conservation and water quality objectives. Though greatly important, little consideration has been given to how specific species will respond to the design and management of riparian buffers or other conservation lands. This study compared avian communities within a chronosequence of riparian buffers established on previously cropped or pastured land with those of the nearby matrix land cover types (row crop fields and an intensively grazed pasture). The riparian buffers consisted of native grasses, forbs, and woody vegetation established at three different times (2, 9, and 14+ years prior to survey). At each site, 10 min point counts for breeding birds were conducted using 50 m fixed radius plots, which were visited eight times between May 15 and July 10, 2008. A total of 54 bird species were observed over all of the study sites. The re-established riparian buffers in this study had higher bird abundance, richness, and diversity than the crop and pasture sites. These results suggest that re-establishing native riparian vegetation in areas of intensive agriculture will provide habitat for a broad suite of bird species, but that specific species will reflect successional stage, horizontal and vertical vegetative structure, and compositional diversity of the buffer vegetation. These results emphasize the importance of matching buffer design and management to species requirements if the objectives are to attract specific target species or species groups.",79,1,97,110,Riparian zone; Vegetation; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Grazing; Chronosequence; Species richness; Agroforestry; Species diversity; Abundance (ecology),,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-009-9270-6 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-009-9270-6/fulltext.html https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103162641 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103162641.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-009-9270-6,,10.1007/s10457-009-9270-6,2056774526,,0,002-804-556-350-740; 007-571-395-247-941; 009-969-155-123-483; 010-423-042-177-734; 010-508-256-532-52X; 015-373-969-372-614; 017-298-227-855-778; 018-031-816-823-049; 018-398-977-970-251; 019-167-790-540-348; 020-360-071-779-440; 021-080-303-062-714; 021-933-813-475-043; 023-683-277-287-21X; 025-715-932-386-959; 029-094-242-107-621; 035-049-792-223-867; 042-985-809-167-140; 051-855-217-004-154; 059-472-939-527-494; 068-452-604-669-157; 072-782-954-705-847; 079-196-971-304-319; 085-403-104-210-257; 092-010-579-589-586; 093-485-123-537-134; 113-900-387-576-996; 115-611-647-492-038; 129-795-413-211-042; 135-655-196-423-016; 137-969-870-156-955; 140-853-509-691-635; 152-835-722-718-83X; 166-952-622-390-540; 170-230-483-322-002; 191-359-559-824-869; 191-508-311-193-465; 191-820-479-471-007,34

Lecomte; Olivier Cerdan,"The effects of grass strips on runoff interception, sediment trapping and soil loss were studied during two agricultural seasons. Field studies, conducted on loamy soil susceptible to sealing, allowed the comparison of three situations corresponding to buffer strip widths of 0, 3 and 6 m located at the downslope end of a winter wheat field. In 1997-98 the 6-m grass strips led to an average increase in infiltration of 87% with a coefficient of variation of 16% in comparison with a situation where no grass strip was present. The 3-m grass strip showed a slightly lower and more variable efficiency (average: 80%, coefficient of variation: 19% in 97/98). Maximum grass strip infiltrability was estimated at about 50 mm/h. Grass strips reduced the event mean sediment concentration by a factor of four on average. Sediments deposited in the grass strip were enriched in sand and coarse silt, whereas exported sediments contained twice as much clay and fine silt as the soil surface horizon.

Tattersall; David W. Macdonald; Barbara Hart; Will Manley; Ruth E. Feber,"Wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus are potentially useful indicators of change in arable ecosystems. Here we focus on changes resulting from removal of land from arable production under the set-aside scheme. Wood mice were radio-tracked to compare: (a) their use of set-aside, crop and hedgerow before and after harvest; (b) set-aside configured as margins and as a 3 ha block; (c) cut and uncut 20-m wide set-aside margins. Males had larger home ranges, and were more mobile than females. Ranges were larger, and animals more mobile, before harvest than afterwards. There were no differences in range sizes of breeding and non-breeding animals after harvest, suggesting that changes in habitat use were not a function of cessation of breeding. Before harvest, wood mice used habitats within their ranges at random, and their ranges contained a high proportion of cropped area. After harvest they preferred hedgerow and avoided margin set-aside within their ranges, but did not similarly avoid the set-aside block. The proportion of cropped area within their ranges decreased after harvest, and the proportion of margin increased. Our evidence suggests wood mice avoided using the area adjacent to the hedgerow, perhaps to avoid predators. Uncut set-aside patches were favoured and cut patches avoided, possibly in response to differences in food availability and levels of protection from predators.

Evapotranspiration rates, surface runoff and percolation of water across a soil profile are controlled by shelterbelts. The heat transfers from cultivated fields to shelterbelts by advection processes enhance evapotranspiration rates from trees. Depth of groundwater table and thermal conditions have important bearing on the uptake of groundwater by trees. The studies showed that in the Turew agricultural landscape, located near Poznan, Poland, shelterbelts use for evapotranspiration 40 percent more water than cultivated fields. For air heating cultivated fields use 280 percent of solar energy more than shelterbelts. The shelterbelts limit N-NO 3 − spreading with groundwater very effectively. Concentrations of inflowing nitrates with groundwater dropped to 2.3–24.4 percent of the input from fields. In contrast to nitrate ions the ammonium behave entirely different. Often concentration of ammonium increased in groundwater under shelterbelts. Higher concentrations of N-NH 4 + under shelterbelts than under field indicated that ammonium ions were released during decomposition of organic matter. This supposition was directly proved by estimates of very high rates of urease activity which enzyme converts urea nitrogen into NH 3 in the final stages of protein decomposition. It was estimated that N 2 O fluxes from soil of shelterbelts are much smaller than from cultivated fields. The balance of nitrogen inputs and outputs in a shelterbelt indicated that the internal recycling of this element is of crucial importance for the controlling efficiency of nitrogen compounds spreading in an environment.",29,4,388,400,Windbreak; Soil horizon; Soil science; Evapotranspiration; Hydrology; Environmental science; Water table; Organic matter; Surface runoff; Nitrogen; Groundwater,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857406002382 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857406002382 https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-60ef5f56-81fd-381f-aa23-52d5596bc1ec,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2006.09.023,,10.1016/j.ecoleng.2006.09.023,1996393708,,0,000-142-952-017-146; 001-362-441-481-335; 001-622-064-959-791; 004-899-536-608-668; 005-945-740-239-143; 007-268-574-761-59X; 011-629-049-818-485; 013-461-152-041-463; 014-577-118-117-883; 025-855-369-559-447; 027-378-268-794-812; 028-027-727-940-922; 030-190-264-906-147; 032-091-089-616-335; 041-606-538-207-737; 049-815-433-020-804; 049-858-542-077-463; 052-982-715-371-625; 060-710-915-387-817; 061-686-069-832-57X; 065-928-186-244-683; 066-322-576-712-016; 070-142-965-217-664; 071-115-517-060-15X; 073-240-629-783-200; 078-036-240-424-326; 086-589-370-874-229; 088-526-158-902-16X; 089-870-113-941-295; 093-987-299-721-330; 108-347-348-160-611; 109-387-438-773-721; 111-435-647-398-863; 122-130-322-941-794; 124-585-222-098-860; 130-538-061-629-549; 130-648-699-134-745; 141-101-347-131-583; 146-828-563-706-870; 147-507-177-734-32X; 166-946-654-361-428; 180-884-962-007-937; 194-568-992-204-273; 198-350-748-008-821,55

P. Sutherland; Matthew Sullivan; Guy M. Poppy,"Summary; 1 The spatial and temporal variations in aphidophagous syrphid abundance were recorded over two seasons in wildflower resource patches sown in a winter barley crop and associated field margins. Standard census techniques and sticky board trapping were used to assess numbers of syrphids, whilst weekly flower head counts were used to quantify the floral resources available in each of the patches.; ; 2 The field margin supported a greater diversity and density of syrphids than the within-crop wildflower patches, despite having a relatively lower flower head density. Presumably this was in response to other resources that field margins offer, namely additional aphid resources, shelter from predation, lekking sites and suitable flight-paths.; ; 3 The commonest species of syrphid, Episyrphus balteatus, demonstrated a very positive habitat association with the field margin and was rarely reported in the field patches. Therefore, it may be an unsuitable candidate for the biological control of aphids via augmentation of numbers using non-host resources.; ; 4 Patch size and shape had little effect on the spatial distributions of syrphids, probably because of the adult syrphids' high mobility.; ; 5 Of greater influence was the number of flowers contained in each habitat patch. Typically, patches with higher numbers of flowers had significantly greater aggregations of hoverflies.

The potential of cutting regimes to control problem weeds and enhance species diversity in an arable field margin buffer strip. Weed Research51, 641–649.; ; ; ; Summary; ; Buffer zones in arable land could promote biodiversity of agricultural areas. These are most often established with sown seed mixtures of grasses and herb species. We studied the impact of cutting management and the role of the seedbank on plant species diversity of a sown buffer strip. Two main hypotheses H1 were tested in this study: (i) sward cutting and removal have positive effects on plant species diversity in a buffer zone adjacent to a cultivated field and (ii) the buffer zone soil seedbank and adjacent grassland act as a species source for the managed buffer zone. After 5 years of management, the number of species was significantly higher and the litter coverage significantly lower in plots mown yearly with cuttings removed than in mown plots with the cuttings left or an uncut control. The abundance of Elymus repens was not affected by the cutting management. To reduce E. repens probably needs cutting more frequently than once per year. Cutting management did not reduce easily-soluble phosphorus in soils. For species colonisation, adjacent grassland played a more important role than the soil seedbank. We conclude that, in this study, the reduced litter cover, together with adjacent sources of species, resulted in the gradual increase in species diversity in the species-poor buffer habitat. This study took place in a single location and similar studies in additional locations would be helpful in assessing the generality of our results. On the evidence of this study, the contract periods of agri-environmental schemes should be longer than 5 years to ensure cutting does result in positive benefits for the management of biodiversity.",51,6,641,649,Biodiversity; Cutting; Global biodiversity; Weed; Buffer zone; Buffer strip; Agroforestry; Species diversity; Agronomy; Arable land; Biology,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2011.00888.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2011.00888.x,,10.1111/j.1365-3180.2011.00888.x,1933842309,,0,002-832-393-044-316; 003-461-880-854-275; 003-617-703-274-032; 005-769-046-282-205; 014-226-881-970-330; 015-072-120-385-142; 020-041-155-134-270; 031-587-910-976-142; 032-192-970-524-05X; 039-505-502-984-134; 054-715-078-148-813; 062-236-461-028-808; 067-095-582-035-356; 070-239-213-610-528; 071-543-579-732-418; 082-139-190-700-359; 097-401-842-948-735; 099-437-976-818-570; 110-254-118-451-922; 110-743-613-765-547; 114-485-264-414-63X; 118-104-179-448-652; 132-397-715-162-287; 137-863-970-555-683; 139-587-466-264-697; 155-691-175-864-748; 158-040-572-868-750; 161-300-804-429-199; 167-175-414-731-307; 170-577-758-467-415,8

A buffer strip experiment consisting of two tree species (Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Casuarina cunninghamiana) with two planting densities and a pasture treatment was conducted to determine the effectiveness of NO3–N removal from a cattle feedlot effluent disposal area at Tullimba near Armidale, NSW Australia. Different management methods were applied for the buffers where grass and weeds were mowed 2–3 times during the second and third years and were not managed during the rest experimental years for the tree buffer, while grass was harvested 1–3 times per year for the pasture buffer. The differences between tree species and planting density significantly affected tree growth, but the growth difference did not significantly affect their capacities to reduce NO3–N in soil surface runoff and groundwater. On average for all the tree and pasture treatments, the buffer strips reduced NO3–N concentration by 8.5%, 14.7% and 14.4% for the surface runoff, shallow and deep groundwater respectively. The tree and pasture buffer strips were not significantly different in NO3–N reduction for both shallow and deep groundwater while the pasture buffer strips reduced significantly more NO3–N concentration in surface runoff than the tree buffer strips. Both buffer strips reduced more than 50% of surface runoff volume indicating that both the tree and pasture buffer strips were efficient at removing water and nutrients, mostly through a significant reduction in soil surface runoff volume.",99,,1,9,Nutrient; Effluent; Pasture; Casuarina cunninghamiana; Eucalyptus camaldulensis; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Agroforestry; Agronomy; Groundwater,,"Agriculture; Animals; Biodegradation, Environmental; Cattle; Eucalyptus/growth & development; Manure; New South Wales; Nitrates/metabolism; Nitrogen/metabolism; Trees/growth & development; Waste Management; Water Pollution/prevention & control",Manure; Nitrates; Nitrogen,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479712000096 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22286134 https://rune.une.edu.au/web/handle/1959.11/10281 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22286134 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479712000096,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.01.008,22286134,10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.01.008,1992750410,,0,001-699-479-136-901; 003-451-422-132-663; 003-888-081-454-171; 005-448-995-003-661; 007-751-667-195-881; 008-380-052-396-94X; 008-467-759-539-985; 009-379-307-440-518; 018-325-017-771-741; 019-293-917-776-188; 022-174-178-603-107; 028-807-340-315-820; 029-786-344-973-990; 030-682-084-703-597; 033-890-182-096-159; 038-088-296-969-193; 038-659-320-814-260; 039-010-174-687-899; 039-107-672-452-76X; 039-563-348-061-272; 043-056-074-783-443; 044-327-313-877-518; 044-401-317-828-273; 044-948-727-495-773; 047-857-691-947-082; 056-444-102-079-143; 056-572-672-082-930; 058-784-912-417-857; 072-750-761-923-411; 074-102-543-976-600; 076-425-864-241-612; 077-872-665-453-904; 080-589-148-600-106; 087-138-533-405-771; 095-263-397-244-602; 110-588-214-484-417; 119-917-653-547-784; 121-468-243-703-60X; 124-062-744-647-895; 138-643-821-809-522; 145-489-774-093-744; 150-539-908-471-485; 154-361-013-339-985; 168-228-690-607-508; 178-684-355-094-284; 186-231-509-533-744; 196-381-785-440-137,19

McCarty,"Six years of point count data in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, USA, were used to investigate how the community structure of grassland birds and the densities of four focal species (common yellowthroat, dickcissel, grasshopper sparrow and sedge wren) varied on conservation lands with differing management strategies (i.e., warm- versus cool-season grasses and low- to high-diversity plantings), and between conservation and unmanaged marginal grasslands (e.g., field borders and terraces). Model-selection results indicated that grasshopper sparrow and dickcissel densities were influenced by grassland type, with higher densities in parcels dominated by warm-season grasses. Species-specific changes in density in response to planting diversity reinforced the value of creating heterogeneous habitat for grassland birds. Densities for all four species were substantially lower in unmanaged marginal grasslands versus conservation parcels and the community structure between the two habitats differed significantly, with generalist species (e.g., American robins, common grackles and grassland species associated with shorter, sparse and patchy vegetation (e.g., horned lark and vesper sparrow)) largely replacing tallgrass specialists in unmanaged marginal grassland parcels.",193,,53,59,Community structure; Vegetation; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Grassland; Sparrow; Yellowthroat; Vesper sparrow; Generalist and specialist species,,,,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5324132 https://experts.nebraska.edu/en/publications/grassland-bird-communities-on-conservation-and-marginal-grassland https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880914002436 https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-arts-and-sciences/environmental-studies/about-us/john-mccarty/docs/papers/Cox%20et%20al.%202014.pdf http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880914002436,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2014.04.026,,10.1016/j.agee.2014.04.026,2154130049,,0,000-587-003-041-373; 000-675-228-558-576; 001-753-720-619-69X; 003-510-625-031-181; 006-156-119-346-48X; 011-287-863-694-168; 013-669-660-897-762; 015-373-969-372-614; 016-260-225-582-630; 017-298-227-855-778; 018-660-321-983-843; 022-053-335-785-514; 027-139-059-151-089; 027-834-516-312-138; 029-087-487-906-426; 031-938-563-126-363; 037-121-377-943-791; 040-613-529-076-690; 041-697-078-495-796; 042-985-809-167-140; 045-663-633-174-116; 048-810-227-527-04X; 051-455-783-816-437; 063-141-893-182-571; 063-149-977-873-288; 064-577-336-376-035; 065-890-360-780-473; 066-046-805-078-760; 074-225-773-604-407; 074-793-529-288-006; 076-278-055-254-459; 086-651-818-648-217; 088-020-713-727-244; 092-022-489-551-486; 093-585-449-315-265; 095-104-916-898-838; 113-900-387-576-996; 114-418-350-670-904; 117-300-622-286-478; 121-413-191-182-188; 127-944-368-077-481; 131-952-910-683-807; 133-858-248-195-498; 134-875-712-461-130; 143-454-151-968-118; 145-468-610-086-190; 150-325-162-873-23X; 154-491-901-376-210; 177-614-216-504-044; 189-679-927-597-067; 193-477-378-603-725; 195-618-519-387-640,6

Mountford,"Agri-environment (AE) schemes aim to arrest declines in arable biodiversity through cereal field margin management options. We evaluated the effectiveness of uncropped cultivated margins (UCM), spring fallow (SF) and cropped conservation headlands with (CH) or without fertiliser inputs (CH(NF)) in sustaining plant species diversity and rare species, in England, UK. Sampling was stratified at 1 m, 3 m and 5 m from the edge of the margin and in eight regions to assess environmental influences on species composition. Species diversity, including rare species, was highest on UCM, followed by SF and CH(NF) margins. Diversity was generally lower on cropped margins due to competition from the crop. Fertilised CH margins were the least diverse option and were similar to cereal crop controls. Species diversity was greatest at the edge of all except UCM margins and there was a strong latitudinal decline in overall diversity and rare species. AE management accounted for more variation in species composition than habitat context, physical/climatic variables, soil properties or region. At cropped sites, there was overlap between margin type and other variables but soil properties explained less variation. At uncropped sites, management and physical/climate variables explained most variation but soil properties were more important than at cropped sites. These findings confirm that AE schemes are effective in conserving arable plants, including rare species, across a variety of landscape types. More precise geographical targeting, improved control of competitive species and research on the habitat requirements of rare species will improve the overall efficacy of schemes in the future.",136,2,260,270,Summer fallow; Biodiversity; Rare species; Habitat; Geography; Context (language use); Agroforestry; Species diversity; Arable land; Competition (biology),,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320706005301,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2006.11.026,,10.1016/j.biocon.2006.11.026,2078317226,,0,012-926-285-189-171; 013-284-533-686-041; 014-229-118-471-777; 016-573-648-664-125; 025-149-893-113-195; 032-842-523-386-275; 047-946-954-821-823; 053-551-700-281-485; 054-274-474-416-858; 056-099-523-856-735; 061-723-728-946-07X; 064-975-099-130-640; 065-071-886-701-523; 073-977-220-319-580; 074-013-046-940-514; 074-793-529-288-006; 079-892-551-731-823; 080-164-660-083-693; 082-540-198-876-114; 083-102-813-642-755; 083-714-994-906-170; 085-894-135-330-699; 109-834-836-962-968; 114-421-043-522-327; 124-362-582-173-520; 132-380-117-709-640; 133-048-738-071-733; 139-998-842-847-885; 149-426-073-095-189; 152-856-891-760-185; 155-372-171-259-972; 197-798-610-196-806,69

Noij; Hanneke I. M. Heesmans; Jan Willem van Groenigen; Piet Groenendijk; Jac T. N. M. Thissen,"Unfertilized buffer strips (BS) generally improve surface water quality. High buffer strip effectiveness (BSE) has been reported for sloping shallow aquifers, but experimental data for plain landscapes with deeply permeable soils is lacking. We tested a novel method to determine BSE on a 20-m-deep, permeable sandy soil. Discharge from soil to ditch was temporarily collected in an in-stream reservoir to measure its quantity and quality, both for a BS and a reference (REF) treatment. Treatments were replicated once for the first, and three times for the next three leaching seasons. No significant BSE was obtained for nitrogen and phosphorus species in the reservoirs. Additionally, water samples were taken from the upper groundwater below the treatments. The effect of BS for nitrate was much bigger in upper groundwater than in the reservoirs that also collected groundwater from greater depths that were not influenced by the treatments. We conclude that measuring changes in upper groundwater to assess BSE is only valid under specific hydrogeological conditions. We propose an alternative experimental set-up for future research, including extra measurements before installing the BS and REF treatments to deal with spatial and temporal variability.

Lye; Kirsty J. Park; Juliet L. Osborne; John M. Holland; Dave Goulson,"Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) play a key role within agricultural systems as pollinators of crops and wild flowers. However, this taxon has suffered severe declines as a result of agricultural intensification. Conservation efforts largely focus on providing forage resources for bumblebees through the summer, but providing suitable habitat during the period of nest foundation in early spring could be a more effective method of boosting local bumblebee populations. This study assesses the attractiveness of three different farmland habitat types (hedgerow, field margin and grassland), and the relative merits of respective land management prescriptions under the Scottish Rural Stewardship scheme to nest site searching and foraging bumblebee queens during the period of queen emergence and colony foundation. Hedgerows were the least attractive habitat type to spring queens. Rural Stewardship species-rich grassland comprised a complex vegetation structure attracting nest site searching queens, whilst grassland that had been abandoned allowing natural regeneration contained more flowers, attracting foraging queens. Field margin habitats were the most attractive habitat type, and Rural Stewardship field margins attracted both nest site searching and foraging queens at relatively high densities. This management option consisted of a sown grass mix, giving rise to the complex vegetation structure preferred by nest site searching queens, but regular disturbance allowed invasion by early flowering bumblebee forage plants. These findings suggest that it should be possible to develop simple combined management strategies to provide both suitable nesting sites and spring forage resources on farmland, promoting bumblebee colony foundation and therefore abundance in the agricultural environment.",142,10,2023,2032,Pollinator; Forage (honey bee); Foraging; Land development; Nest; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Grassland; Bumblebee,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320709001670#! https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/2560 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093271901 http://www.sussex.ac.uk/lifesci/goulsonlab/documents/lye-et-al-biol-cons-2009.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320709001670 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/762895 http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/51203/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2009.03.032,,10.1016/j.biocon.2009.03.032,2127718964,,0,003-460-280-575-85X; 009-012-164-159-153; 016-421-756-148-512; 018-398-533-626-927; 018-442-796-237-224; 028-307-444-523-789; 031-007-699-396-56X; 031-592-787-048-258; 031-862-039-493-29X; 033-211-144-712-857; 034-980-495-883-757; 035-775-229-294-961; 038-618-402-954-434; 046-004-550-166-441; 052-363-993-930-092; 054-715-078-148-813; 056-585-869-238-25X; 056-789-845-462-569; 083-810-224-480-214; 085-941-087-561-247; 090-482-842-181-40X; 094-542-264-880-862; 105-466-690-006-049; 114-016-061-618-278; 117-345-687-903-78X; 119-050-749-935-758; 125-995-631-935-63X; 155-691-175-864-748; 156-207-702-434-918; 165-420-840-117-725; 165-804-108-473-473; 168-312-770-361-773; 169-297-520-424-667,79

Total beetle abundance and also abundance of economically important pest beetles decreased significantly with age of wildflower areas, showing that wildflower areas did not promote large populations with habitat age. Beetle species richness was significantly higher in 2–4 year old wildflower areas than in wheat. Diversity and evenness increased significantly with habitat age. Beetle species composition of wheat differed clearly from that in wildflower areas. Beetle assemblage was significantly associated with plant species richness, vegetation structure and plant biomass, accounting for 11.75, 10.73 and 9.71% of the total variance, respectively. It is therefore recommended to maintain a mosaic of wildflower areas of different age to conserve high beetle diversity in agroecosystems.",152,,21,26,Biomass (ecology); Species evenness; Biodiversity; Vegetation; Habitat; Ecology; Wildflower; Species richness; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/33067164 https://boris.unibe.ch/38976/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880912000515 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880912000515,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2012.01.027,,10.1016/j.agee.2012.01.027,1986929728,,0,006-476-271-169-687; 008-011-504-897-363; 013-144-739-926-739; 014-420-425-932-76X; 019-060-458-694-45X; 020-831-252-589-740; 026-527-744-858-38X; 031-579-378-413-334; 035-427-523-962-480; 037-002-778-558-737; 041-768-237-199-317; 042-181-275-873-417; 042-791-466-442-183; 043-940-041-145-856; 053-832-610-795-117; 056-789-845-462-569; 058-211-107-972-024; 066-696-436-185-636; 071-363-274-178-219; 073-359-404-037-66X; 074-657-096-997-491; 096-497-658-401-644; 098-575-226-696-438; 110-673-327-117-273; 113-707-700-078-666; 117-345-687-903-78X; 126-789-023-163-372; 127-029-369-930-692; 128-569-652-424-254; 149-431-649-896-445; 187-603-367-498-373; 193-338-755-951-750; 199-807-315-303-239,17

Vianello; Alfonso Infantino; Giuseppe Zanin; A. Di Guardo,"Narrow vegetative filter strips (VFS) proved to effectively reduce herbicide runoff from cultivated fields mainly due to the ability of vegetation to delay surface runoff, promote infiltration and adsorb herbicides. Since VFS are dynamic systems, their performance would not remain constant over the years indicating the need to define suitable buffer management. In order to evaluate the performance of different five and six year-old VFS, the runoff of the herbicides metolachlor and terbuthylazine was monitored in 2002 and 2003 in an experimental site in northern Italy. The structure of the herbaceous cover in the buffers changes over time. When rows of trees are present, the grass cover is decreased by the shading action of the trees, but the leaf litter gains importance. In VFS with grass cover only, the cover composition changes because of the substitution of grass by broadleaf species. Six metres wide VFS are very effective in reducing runoff volume and concentration during both wet and dry years. Classification analysis showed that runoff concentration and volume are linked to the characteristics of the rainfall event, buffer, source of herbicides and time after application. Regression analysis showed that the significant predictors for runoff volume are rainfall amount and intensity, total vegetal cover in the VFS, crop leaf area index and time after treatment; for concentration they are rainfall intensity, crop leaf area index and total vegetal cover in the VFS. The role of VFS is complex, so appropriate management is required to maintain its increasing filtering capacity over time.",71,1,74,82,Infiltration (hydrology); Plant cover; Leaf area index; Terbuthylazine; Metolachlor; Filter strip; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Agronomy; Environmental engineering,,Filtration; Herbicides/isolation & purification; Plants/metabolism; Rain; Regression Analysis,Herbicides,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18045643 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008Chmsp..71...74O/abstract https://core.ac.uk/display/53413590 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004565350701291X https://www.research.unipd.it/handle/11577/2270552,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2007.10.029,18045643,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2007.10.029,2072473680,,0,002-650-706-842-54X; 004-946-735-949-069; 012-264-524-522-980; 013-316-180-822-055; 017-329-056-922-292; 020-537-450-372-975; 021-655-763-861-159; 024-998-467-249-663; 025-131-472-929-81X; 028-034-500-501-517; 029-227-515-568-324; 034-195-159-242-383; 042-230-387-909-769; 044-327-313-877-518; 051-200-045-837-899; 052-589-530-283-548; 052-894-240-545-387; 064-662-281-730-944; 066-008-497-105-394; 079-562-504-772-874; 080-894-085-139-156; 083-528-691-484-522; 086-496-072-727-834; 094-049-137-663-313; 096-878-710-039-072; 103-148-967-328-600; 103-286-115-762-912; 104-230-077-662-702; 107-861-247-559-610; 111-288-588-656-115; 117-074-543-175-080; 128-195-997-346-382; 135-211-483-825-15X; 138-643-821-809-522; 142-092-889-852-638; 159-359-733-987-293; 181-090-792-931-175; 191-147-319-900-194,53

(3) In a multiple regression analysis the amount of dead grass present in the base of the hedge was the best predictor of grey partridge breeding density within farms after the length of the field boundary was taken into account. A similar analysis for red-legged partridges showed that the amount of nettle present at the base of field boundaries was the only variable related to breeding density after the overall length was taken into account. Between farms, the breeding density of both species was unrelated to the hedgerow characteristics. (4) The importance of hedges and hedgerow management to partridges is discussed.

Muhl.), Kentucky Bluegrass (Poa pratensis), Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), and non-vegetated control buffers were subjected to artificial flooding with cattle (Bos taurus) manure-laden water. Mean bacteria concentrations in overland flow exiting all plots were significantly higher than concentrations found in the source slurry. To assess E. coli persistence in plots, overland flow was collected from a simulated rainfall event 4 days following slurry application, and from natural rainfall events 22, 46, 94, 97, and 111 days after the application. Overland flow exiting all plots (including non-vegetated controls) exhibited mean E. coli concentrations significantly higher than those found in the initial slurry applied. The observed concentrations may have been the result of overland flow characteristics and high levels of ambient fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) present with plots. The moist, shaded conditions created by plot vegetation may have produced prime habitat to harbor FIB. Vegetated buffer strips (VBS) may have been effective at attenuating FIB, however, performance may have been masked by the exceptionally high ambient FIB populations that were present in adjacent soils. The young age of the VBS (<1 year) may have also influenced their seemingly poor FIB attenuation. As the VBS age, increases in above and below ground vegetative material may act to increase VBS attenuation capabilities.",87,6,1405,1419,Fecal coliform; Soil water; Ecology; Indicator bacteria; Arundinaria gigantea; Riparian buffer; Poa pratensis; Dactylis glomerata; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Agronomy,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10457-013-9647-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-013-9647-4,,10.1007/s10457-013-9647-4,2039809715,,0,000-102-079-715-41X; 003-888-081-454-171; 007-071-648-273-363; 007-739-914-555-687; 007-751-667-195-881; 008-197-047-139-556; 008-404-996-745-311; 009-165-734-166-353; 009-307-197-602-973; 010-752-012-497-371; 011-487-269-075-467; 011-648-696-888-176; 014-561-967-561-763; 016-607-616-437-334; 029-178-168-294-083; 038-439-180-047-201; 039-197-226-828-079; 040-055-935-284-272; 040-507-938-290-621; 044-401-317-828-273; 044-982-906-041-039; 045-878-014-461-966; 047-279-054-681-048; 049-939-662-240-178; 051-814-821-041-364; 054-437-669-384-132; 062-427-769-001-566; 064-254-412-327-563; 076-436-701-138-403; 078-198-339-369-832; 086-873-034-193-158; 089-366-440-498-718; 090-662-060-290-490; 092-856-270-668-592; 094-913-241-725-317; 097-548-385-078-792; 099-857-638-754-94X; 101-774-056-400-814; 104-494-518-145-022; 109-853-292-000-237; 110-331-222-074-203; 114-607-434-269-512; 115-595-176-702-379; 115-642-860-718-878; 115-864-182-852-341; 118-928-212-112-766; 122-905-248-651-828; 128-967-284-462-815; 131-156-569-978-347; 142-501-845-192-863; 158-286-217-346-747; 158-517-969-155-228; 169-607-559-923-667; 171-831-215-685-94X; 175-249-970-563-710; 175-302-560-900-147; 176-617-948-486-66X; 197-881-386-442-925,4

Walton; Rufus Isaacs,"Conservation plantings of native wildflowers were established adjacent to highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) fields to test the hypothesis that provision of resources for natural enemies increases their abundance in adjacent crop fields without increasing the abundance of pest insects. For two growing seasons, natural enemies and herbivorous insects were sampled in fields with flowering borders and in control fields where growers maintained standard mown grass perimeters. Insects were categorized according to their trophic level and their potential pest status, and their abundance was compared between years and between treatments. Syrphid flies (Diptera: Syrphidae) were significantly more abundant in fields with conservation strips, as were plant bugs (Hemiptera: Miridae), thrips (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), and hoppers (Hemiptera: Auchenorrhyncha). Aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae), thrips, fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae), and pirate bugs (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) decreased significantly in abundance from 2007 to 2008. Beneficial insect abundance in crop fields increased in the latter half of the season in both years and this increase was more pronounced in fields adjacent to conservation plantings.

Aims To investigate the role of habitat and structural hedgerow components on breeding densities of Robins and to provide baseline territory density estimates for the Robin in a range of habitats in southwest Ireland. Methods Robin territory densities were estimated at 39 sites of five major habitat types in southwest Ireland. A modified CBC-type technique was used to census Robins and additional habitat data were collected at each site. One-way ANOVA with post hoc testing was used to investigate the population densities between the different habitat groupings, and a principal component analysis of habitat data was used to generate independent variables for a stepwise regression where territory density per hectare and territory density per kilometre were, in turn, the dependent variables. Results Population densities varied significantly between habitat types.

Smith; Ary A. Hoffmann; Linda J. Thomson,"Coccinellidae are important natural enemies of agricultural pests in a variety of crops and there is interest in landscape manipulation to enhance coccinellid populations. Here we investigate impacts of non-crop woody vegetation variables, adjacent crop type and abundance of aphid prey on coccinellid abundance in shelterbelts adjacent to vineyards or pasture near Melbourne, Australia. Sixty sites were sampled five times at monthly intervals using yellow sticky traps. The abundance of coccinellids in shelterbelts was influenced to a greater extent by adjacent crop type and aphid abundance rather than vegetation characteristics like canopy flowers. Abundance of some species was 2–5 times higher in riparian shelterbelts while increased litter depth decreased abundance. When the leaf litter depth of shelterbelts was experimentally increased, the abundance of coccinellids decreased, whereas an experimental decrease in porosity tended to have the opposite effect. These findings suggest that coccinellid abundance can be influenced to some extent by characteristics of shelterbelts, but crop type and prey availability is likely to have a relatively larger impact, perhaps reflecting the high movement rates of this group of natural enemies.",87,,47,55,Canopy; Riparian zone; Crop; Vegetation; Ecology; Aphid; Litter; Plant litter; Agronomy; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Jasper Loftus-Hill Memorial Fund,https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/980553-coccinellid-abundance-in-shelterbelts-is-affected-more-by-adjacent-crop-type-and-aphid-abundance-than-vegetation-characteristics https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND605328884 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049964415000493 https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/handle/11343/116028/Coccinellid abundance in shelterbelts is affected more by adjacent crop type and aphid abundance than vegetation characteristics.pdf https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/116028 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049964415000493 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153205860,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2015.04.004,,10.1016/j.biocontrol.2015.04.004,2058759188,,0,002-669-586-055-41X; 002-807-630-235-286; 004-110-965-143-490; 006-126-944-893-638; 007-627-046-927-949; 009-306-296-135-325; 009-486-697-690-814; 009-909-414-518-97X; 011-508-246-956-659; 012-249-776-686-185; 016-149-669-316-514; 019-695-796-213-427; 021-236-302-739-146; 028-502-011-491-666; 029-715-712-982-084; 030-826-400-843-699; 031-649-251-196-994; 031-715-316-035-351; 033-750-034-115-624; 041-266-864-815-908; 041-947-413-095-773; 042-063-668-748-855; 042-506-090-674-633; 045-609-614-596-025; 047-367-958-846-378; 047-904-063-349-304; 049-556-511-622-111; 050-690-204-351-14X; 052-169-960-632-831; 056-369-646-640-317; 056-892-630-404-500; 057-597-475-456-662; 062-845-134-713-676; 065-717-158-017-31X; 066-675-844-981-559; 068-324-114-581-105; 069-534-790-574-164; 069-652-085-406-242; 072-652-021-860-014; 072-709-242-586-906; 074-988-203-965-206; 082-380-848-044-898; 085-480-955-678-72X; 086-157-284-213-011; 086-454-977-440-314; 086-772-523-171-58X; 087-520-578-895-249; 094-515-841-908-877; 095-445-262-637-385; 100-381-410-629-790; 102-089-721-858-624; 102-666-086-420-144; 103-348-929-033-891; 106-892-279-185-890; 109-691-661-850-685; 110-377-922-783-864; 111-528-391-156-029; 116-970-112-350-173; 119-269-180-005-666; 128-047-532-656-693; 130-176-875-656-76X; 137-138-675-208-951; 141-780-299-295-803; 149-080-419-037-846; 153-991-299-674-892; 157-445-976-922-759; 173-470-822-613-835; 173-675-987-660-014; 176-325-204-558-566; 176-713-020-049-294,5

Hubbard,"We determined the water quality effect of a restored forested riparian wetland adjacent to a manure application area and a heavily fertilized pasture in the Georgia Coastal Plain. The buffer system was managed based on USDA recommendations and averaged 38 m in width. Water quality and hydrology data were collected from 1991-1999. A nitrate plume in shallow ground water with concentrations exceeding 10 mg NO3-N L(-1) moved into the restored forested riparian wetland. Along most of the plume front, concentrations were less than 4 mg NO3-N L(-1) within 25 m. Two preferential flow paths associated with past hydrologic modifications to the site allowed the nitrate plume to progress further into the restored forested riparian wetland. Surface runoff total N, dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), and total P concentrations averaged 8.63 mg N L(-1), 1.37 mg P L(-1), and 1.48 mg P L(-1), respectively, at the field edge and were reduced to 4.18 mg N L(-1), 0.31 mg P L(-1), and 0.36 mg P L(-1), respectively, at the restored forested riparian wetland outlet. Water and nutrient mass balance showed that retention and removal rates for nitrogen species ranged from a high of 78% for nitrate to a low of 52% for ammonium. Retention rates for both DRP and total P were 66%. Most of the N retention and removal was accounted for by denitrification. Mean annual concentrations of total N and total P leaving the restored forested riparian wetland were 1.98 mg N L(-1) and 0.24 mg P L(-1), respectively.",32,2,711,726,Riparian zone; Animal science; Nutrient; Nitrate; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science; Phosphorus; Wetland; Denitrification; Hydrology (agriculture),,Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Manure; Nitrogen/analysis; Phosphorus/analysis; Solubility; Trees; Water Movements,Manure; Phosphorus; Nitrogen,Georgia Water Resources Program; Georgia Department of Natural Resources; USEPA Wetlands Research Program; USEPA Wetlands Research Program; USDA-CSREES; National Research Initiative,http://eva.universidad.edu.uy/pluginfile.php/160439/mod_page/content/1/colloquia-2-teamswork/Colloquia_2_-_team_1.pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12708697 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2003.7110 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/2643697 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12708697/,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2003.7110,12708697,10.2134/jeq2003.7110,2041202585,,0,001-578-200-831-78X; 002-366-294-773-665; 002-937-270-631-538; 008-870-177-382-21X; 009-206-379-968-068; 009-742-460-635-737; 015-514-563-181-208; 017-068-318-872-81X; 017-365-652-956-569; 026-267-303-943-038; 026-868-019-777-822; 030-952-205-937-160; 034-748-846-517-673; 040-229-676-588-390; 047-522-397-491-315; 058-218-489-015-546; 064-656-269-307-94X; 068-532-871-451-208; 071-748-824-475-654; 075-611-331-410-172; 075-847-940-362-322; 076-826-572-086-275; 078-070-242-722-190; 080-589-148-600-106; 081-146-598-099-607; 086-190-138-130-44X; 103-231-338-453-473; 104-974-580-642-671; 108-895-083-009-410; 113-496-738-919-590; 117-260-313-742-640; 117-980-015-197-109; 128-195-997-346-382; 133-773-961-663-944; 140-655-986-659-737; 141-101-347-131-583; 169-607-559-923-667; 175-950-958-362-911; 176-609-653-505-894; 177-770-652-793-529; 182-505-603-837-437,67

The aims of this study were to evaluate visual impacts of the General Agri-Environmental Protection Scheme (GAEPS) and Supplementary Protection Scheme (SPS) and general attitudes towards some activities in those policies and furthermore to examine the suitability of the method of Alho et al. (2001) for the scenic beauty assessment. The study areas consisted of three original, untreated, and 15 modified rural landscapes representing a variety of different activities. The scenic beauty of the landscapes was evaluated through pairwise comparisons of the responses of 68 people. Furthermore, attitudes towards environmental values, water protection, buffer strips and subsidies to agriculture were obtained. The respondents found the maintained buffer strips more pleasing than unmaintained strips and considered that the quality of watercourses was increased by buffer strips along them. A suitable width for the buffer strip along main ditches, brooks and waterways was regarded, on average, to be wider than the current recommendations. Although the opinions of farmers were basically in line with the existing recommendations, farmers' opininons on the second and third most important effects of buffer strips, an increase in weeds and a decrease in cultivated land, clearly differed from those of the other respondents. Afforestation, lack of building maintenance and abandoned fields were considered to be the most important factors impacting rural landscapes. This study indicates that the Finnish Agri-Environmental Protection Schemes have had positive impacts on the visual quality of landscapes. Attitudes towards other impacts are contradictory. This study also showed the improvement of the Alho et al.

Data were extracted from 11 farms surveyed by territory mapping between 1966 and 1986 as part of the British Trust for Ornithology's Common Birds Census. The population size of 38 bird species was quantified for each farm in each year. The extents of five non-crop habitats were measured at 4-yearly intervals on each farm. The farms were selected because some had undergone extensive removal of non-crop habitats while others had undergone little or none. Although declines were commonest on farms where the severest habitat loss had taken place, we found no evidence that habitat loss was the main factor causing population declines: all 11 farms had significant numbers of declining species, even where habitat loss was minimal. Furthermore, general linear modelling found no significant effects of habitat loss on population trends and principal-components analysis found limited effects of habitat extent on community composition. These results suggest that habitat loss is of secondary importance in causing farmland bird population declines. We suggest that other processes, such as habitat degradation, may have caused a baseline population decline in at least 10 farmland bird species and that declines may have been exacerbated by localised habitat loss.",116,1-2,120,127,,Habitat degradation; Habitat loss; Hedgerows; Key words Farmland birds; Population declines,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420050570,28308516,10.1007/s004420050570,,,0,,47

Eight infiltration measurements were made, in each of six treatments. Bulk density, antecedent soil moisture, and particle size were also examined. The average 60-min cumulative infiltration was five times greater under the buffers than under the cultivated field and pasture. Cumulative infiltration in the multi-species riparian buffer was in the order of silver maple > grass filter > switchgrass. Cumulative infiltration did not differ significantly (P < 0.05) among corn and soybean crop fields and the pasture. Soil bulk densities under the multi-species buffer vegetation were significantly (P < 0.05) smaller than in the crop fields and the pasture. Other measured parameters did not show consistent trends.

Bradley; Joann K. Whalen; Pierre-Luc Chagnon; M. Lanoix; Marlene Cristina Alves,"Abstract Vegetated riparian buffer strips have been established in Southern Quebec (Canada) in order to intercept nutrients such as nitrate (NO3−) and protect water quality near agricultural fields. Buffer strips may also favour denitrification through a combination of high soil moisture, NO3− and carbon supply, which could lead to the production of nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas. Denitrification could be further amplified by the presence of earthworms, or by plant species that promote earthworm and bacterial activity in soils. Soils from four farms, comprising maize fields and adjacent buffer strips, were sampled in the fall of 2008. A total of six earthworm species were found, but average earthworm biomass did not differ between buffer strips and maize agroecoecosystems. Nitrate concentrations and net nitrification rates were higher in the maize fields than in the buffer strips; there was no difference in N2O production in soils collected from the two sampling locations. Potential denitrification, measured by acetylene inhibition, varied by two orders of magnitude, depending on experimental conditions; when amended with H2O or with H2O + NO3−, potential denitrification was higher (P",47,1,6,13,Riparian zone; Soil water; Nitrification; Earthworm; Riparian buffer; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Plant litter; Agronomy; Denitrification,,,,,http://repositorio.unesp.br/handle/11449/41716 http://nrs-staff.mcgill.ca/whalen/publications/Applied%20Soil%20Ecology%202011%20v47%20pp6-13.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139310002179,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2010.11.007,,10.1016/j.apsoil.2010.11.007,2080584812,,0,000-046-722-937-270; 001-268-659-882-253; 003-207-619-482-38X; 008-068-273-261-532; 010-490-707-346-353; 010-492-231-230-88X; 016-475-292-873-68X; 020-162-258-114-150; 022-832-199-412-299; 022-961-573-010-021; 024-838-199-584-517; 025-522-099-454-868; 025-840-291-663-911; 025-869-422-924-907; 028-146-838-004-688; 028-603-561-741-239; 029-491-286-007-883; 030-265-661-058-499; 030-984-951-057-321; 032-161-474-759-19X; 033-039-103-895-077; 034-536-065-396-085; 041-938-045-944-414; 046-822-994-663-953; 060-188-753-206-104; 063-963-834-687-484; 074-551-937-090-347; 075-079-067-037-277; 075-516-918-876-902; 090-661-537-558-403; 097-041-082-583-983; 098-923-770-173-110; 116-073-484-834-128; 118-235-652-966-907; 120-671-214-741-663; 121-061-661-706-817; 121-691-035-270-645; 124-941-635-438-075; 135-233-059-071-616; 136-816-007-966-101; 142-671-361-514-75X; 147-262-720-995-845; 175-069-338-986-957; 180-339-326-057-905; 184-635-815-001-277,27

Anderson; Ranjith P. Udawatta,"Agroforestry buffers, which include trees, grass, and shrubs, have been proposed for improving water quality in watersheds. The objectives of the study were to compare differences in macropore (> 1000-μm diam.) and coarse mesopore (200-1000-μm diam.) parameters measured by computed tomography (CT) within agroforestry buffer (AgB) and grass buffer (GB) systems associated with rotationally grazed pasture (RG) and continuously grazed pasture (CG) systems, and to examine relationships between CT-measured pore parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K sat ). Pasture and GB areas included red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and Korean lespedeza [Kummerowia stipulacea (Maxim.) Makino] planted into fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), while AgB included eastern cottonwood trees (Populus deltoides W. Bartram ex Marshall ssp. deltoides) planted into fescue. Soils at the site were Menfro silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludalf). Intact soil cores were collected from the four treatments at five soil depths. Five equally spaced images were acquired from each core and were analyzed with Image-J software. The CT-measured soil macroporosity was 13 times higher (0.053 m 3 m- 3 ) for the buffer treatments than the pasture treatments (0.004 m 3 m -3 ) for the surface 0- to 10-cm soil depth. Buffer treatments had greater macroporosity (0.02 m 3 m- 3 ) than RG (0.005 m 3 m -3) or CG (0.004 m 3 m -3 ) treatments. The K sat values for buffer treatments were five times higher than pasture treatments. Soil bulk density was 5.6% lower for the buffer treatments than the pasture treatments. The CT-measured pore parameters (except macropore circularity) were positively correlated with K sat . This study illustrates the benefits of agroforestey and grass buffers for maintaining soil pore parameters critical for soil water transport.",74,1,203,212,Loam; Soil water; Festuca arundinacea; Pasture; Kummerowia stipulacea; Eastern Cottonwood; Water transport; Environmental science; Agroforestry; Macropore,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010SSASJ..74..203K/abstract https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2136/sssaj2008.0409 https://core.ac.uk/display/102603447 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/775061 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103115680,http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2008.0409,,10.2136/sssaj2008.0409,2022451985,,0,004-771-960-697-150; 005-742-835-423-082; 008-297-788-251-260; 008-380-052-396-94X; 008-774-488-937-913; 009-734-707-902-332; 012-189-159-930-056; 018-956-547-227-04X; 029-811-038-300-984; 033-036-876-989-40X; 036-466-585-417-013; 038-439-180-047-201; 046-892-304-956-18X; 049-820-579-650-450; 052-473-402-221-794; 052-924-687-684-687; 054-142-450-794-649; 055-943-387-311-507; 057-746-733-301-935; 066-462-026-689-709; 067-661-924-346-271; 068-864-426-070-192; 071-167-876-727-598; 072-789-243-593-764; 079-129-085-692-492; 085-033-806-387-06X; 088-017-310-971-747; 092-018-046-823-794; 094-386-783-945-275; 095-312-534-361-222; 132-425-609-614-396; 137-328-970-159-387; 147-694-651-965-413; 165-388-551-938-802; 168-599-905-482-320,31

Blattel; Karl W. J. Williard; Sara G. Baer; James J. Zaczek,"Forest and grass riparian buffers have been shown to be effective best management practices for controlling nonpoint source pollution. However, little research has been conducted on giant cane [Arundinaria gigantea (Walt. Muhl.)], a formerly common bamboo species, native to the lower midwestern and southeastern United States, and its ability to reduce nutrient loads to streams. From May 2002 through May 2003, orthophosphate or dissolved reactive phosphate (DRP) concentrations in ground water were measured at successive distances from the field edge through 12 m of riparian buffers of both giant cane and mixed hardwood forest along three streams draining agricultural land in the Cache River watershed in southern Illinois. Giant cane and mixed hardwood forest did not differ in their DRP sequestration abilities. Ground water DRP concentrations were significantly reduced (14 percent) in the first 1.5 m of the buffers, and there was an overall 28 percent reduction in DRP concentration by 12 m from the field edge. The relatively low DRP reductions compared to other studies could be attributed to high DRP input levels, narrow (12 m) buffer lengths, and/or mature (28 to 48 year old) riparian vegetation.",41,2,301,307,Riparian zone; Nutrient; Vegetation; Nonpoint source pollution; Cane; Arundinaria gigantea; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science; STREAMS,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005JAWRA..41..301B/abstract https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03736.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03736.x,,10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03736.x,2067190531,,0,002-321-610-856-114; 005-448-995-003-661; 007-751-667-195-881; 008-467-759-539-985; 015-514-563-181-208; 016-437-799-863-096; 021-183-877-274-187; 027-089-714-082-495; 038-659-320-814-260; 040-935-957-450-37X; 044-401-317-828-273; 044-982-906-041-039; 046-568-769-714-434; 048-148-537-416-261; 048-539-299-998-646; 056-580-414-502-20X; 057-754-079-026-35X; 080-589-148-600-106; 095-263-397-244-602; 121-468-243-703-60X; 141-101-347-131-583; 142-124-709-800-413; 155-766-286-657-649; 158-638-141-901-64X; 168-833-796-517-696; 187-865-166-920-62X,13

The aim of the study was to identify the condition of bee flora and determine the floristic richness depending on the biotops in agricultural landscape. Flora of the anthropogenic refuge areas consists of 214 species, among them 80% were flow taxons. Apophytes (162 species - 78%) predominated on all types of biotops under consideration. Perennials predominated in flora of boundary strips and bush communities. Mainly annual (40%) and biennial (15%) species comprise the flora of fallows. A great number of bee taxons represent meadow, segetal or ruderal communities. Most of flow plants compose loose patches, but their successive blooming ensures a source of food for Apoidea from early spring till the end of summer. The flora of boundary strips, bush communities and fallows significantly increases the biodiversity in agricultural landscape. The treatments including sowing, mainly on fallows with nectariferous and polleniferous species, would enrich generally weak flows in highly agricultural landscape.",60,1,147,157,Agriculture; Biodiversity; Flora; Ruderal species; Ecology; Geography; Perennial plant; Apoidea; Floristics; Species richness,,,,,https://pbsociety.org.pl/journals/index.php/aa/article/view/aa.2007.018/1403 https://doaj.org/article/20e11e1792fa47468c260e4c7a7101f5 http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-article-3d995a9c-25f4-4c94-8922-e971c8f08a69 https://pbsociety.org.pl/journals/index.php/aa/article/download/aa.2007.018/1403 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/229992942.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5586/aa.2007.018,,10.5586/aa.2007.018,2007505966,,0,,19

Isenhart; T. B. Parkin; Richard C. Schultz; T.E. Loynachan,"While water quality functions of conservatian buffers established adjacent to cropped fields have been widely documented, the relative contribution of these re-established perennial plant systems to greenhouse gases has not been completely documented. In the case of methane (CH 4 ), these systems have the potential to serve as sinks of CH 4 or may provide favorable conditions for CH 4 production. This study quantifies CH 4 flux from soils of riparian buffer systems comprised of three vegetation types and compares these fluxes with those of adjacent crop fields. We measured soil properties and diel and seasonal variations of CH 4 flux in 7 to 17 yr-oLd re-established riparian forest buffers, warm-season and cool-season grass filters, and an adjacent crop field located in the Bear Creek watershed in central Iowa. Forest buffer and grass filter soils had significantly lower bulk density (P < 0.01); and higher pH (P < 0.01), total carbon (TC) (P < 0.01), and total nitrogen (TN) (P < 0.01) than crop field soils. There was no significant relationship between CH 4 flux and soil moisture or soil temperature among sites within the range of conditions observed. Cumulative CH 4 flux was -0.80 kg CH 4 -C ha -1 yr -1 in the cropped field, -0.46 kg CH 4 -C ha -1 yr -1 within the forest buffers, and 0.04 kg CH 4 -C ha -1 yr -1 within grass filters, but difference among vegetation covers was not significant. Results suggest that CH 4 flux was not changed after establishment of perennial vegetation on cropped soils, despite significant changes in soil properties.",39,1,97,105,Riparian zone; Riparian forest; Soil science; Soil water; Vegetation; Perennial plant; Water content; Riparian buffer; Environmental science; Agronomy; Bulk density,,"Agriculture; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring/methods; Methane/chemistry; Rivers; Soil/analysis; Soil Pollutants/chemistry; Water Pollutants, Chemical/chemistry","Soil; Soil Pollutants; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Methane",U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; U.S. Department of Agriculture,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/20048297 https://works.bepress.com/thomas_isenhart/17/download/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20048297 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1176&context=nrem_pubs https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/nrem_pubs/174/ https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103117932 https://works.bepress.com/richard_schultz/25/ https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2008.0408,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2008.0408,20048297,10.2134/jeq2008.0408,2046183543,,0,000-439-957-255-861; 002-937-270-631-538; 005-222-102-566-554; 007-818-298-572-998; 008-894-108-165-234; 009-379-307-440-518; 009-895-283-404-897; 013-828-182-361-650; 016-216-735-430-372; 016-962-712-491-943; 017-709-159-607-177; 018-339-500-838-974; 018-886-781-170-044; 020-645-937-108-04X; 023-923-178-342-877; 025-295-191-438-441; 028-887-330-023-878; 030-915-143-929-807; 031-911-929-410-650; 031-988-523-433-612; 035-586-007-821-014; 038-439-180-047-201; 038-915-129-340-87X; 042-205-900-305-006; 044-948-727-495-773; 048-446-908-175-408; 049-138-059-558-261; 056-646-407-174-817; 060-985-751-889-863; 063-133-426-126-992; 064-142-249-606-389; 064-240-859-714-503; 065-255-435-146-766; 070-171-023-805-414; 072-697-007-874-005; 079-196-971-304-319; 081-588-327-517-617; 089-779-424-018-628; 090-235-500-995-608; 101-012-916-569-644; 107-413-695-105-63X; 109-925-918-120-530; 110-455-260-826-407; 122-193-974-026-944; 127-785-284-544-120; 130-057-810-773-170; 146-308-654-514-277; 153-985-431-075-897; 159-667-736-364-096; 161-490-085-163-215; 168-228-690-607-508; 186-231-509-533-744; 191-359-559-824-869,27

Given these premises, a study was done on the eastern Po Plain, in a transition area between the Temperate (Eurosiberian) and Mediterranean climatic zones, adopting the same sample shape and dimensions as a North-American study [Corbit et al. (1999) J Ecol 87:220–232]. The following research questions were posed: (1) how common are forest species in hedgerows? (2) do origin, isolation, distance from source, width and adjacent land-use factors correlate with the frequency of forest species? (3) are hedgerows corridors for forest species? To address these, three functional types of hedgerows, identified by comparing old aerial-photos, were sampled: remnant attached (n = 12) and remnant isolated (n = 6) with respect to the nearest woodland and regenerated attached (n = 4). If wooded patches were a source for hedgerows, then regenerated hedgerows should be more similar to an adjacent woodland than an isolated remnant. A 900 m2 circular plot in woodlands and an adjacent 90-m transect along hedgerows were sampled for the presence and cover of all plant species, then 39 woodland taxa were selected. Significant differences between the three hedgerow types emerged in forest species richness, but not in cover. The forest species composition in both remnant and regenerated attached hedgerows showed a strong affinity with the adjacent stand, implying a dispersal process from woodland (source) to regenerated hedgerows (sink). A distance effect on forest species distribution clearly linked to a corridor function was found only in regenerated hedgerows, while in the remnant attached ones, even with a composition similar to that of the nearest woodland source, other additional factors cannot be ignored to explain the fine scale distribution of forest species. The cover of the most common ant-dispersed species showed a similar distance effect while vertebrate-dispersed ones did not show any significant trend with distance from woodlands. Habitat suitability for forest species was affected by width, especially in hedges wider than 12 m, but not by adjacent land use.",188,2,235,252,Biodiversity; Species distribution; Ecology; Woodland; Geography; Mediterranean climate; Biological dispersal; Species richness; Transect; Temperate climate,,,,,http://paduaresearch.cab.unipd.it/4406/ https://www.jstor.org/stable/40212890 https://www.jstor.org/stable/info/40212890 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11258-006-9159-7 http://paduaresearch.cab.unipd.it/4406/1/Sitzia_2007.pdf https://www.research.unipd.it/handle/11577/1776850 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11258-006-9159-7.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-006-9159-7,,10.1007/s11258-006-9159-7,2092468039,,0,009-635-796-421-843; 010-250-877-529-926; 010-491-073-636-58X; 018-023-127-841-209; 018-463-393-074-304; 019-678-192-960-072; 019-843-445-116-58X; 020-397-079-701-583; 023-187-218-601-114; 024-608-779-166-000; 026-524-247-263-808; 026-926-325-058-247; 029-166-097-649-722; 033-432-973-124-71X; 035-857-688-042-308; 036-681-752-627-926; 036-838-626-539-581; 037-025-174-020-76X; 037-918-730-170-24X; 040-004-831-914-831; 040-274-357-523-365; 042-721-756-492-134; 042-901-767-821-19X; 044-037-639-154-912; 046-559-721-405-224; 047-994-627-473-32X; 051-197-969-663-775; 053-441-336-748-650; 055-051-694-358-299; 057-001-477-328-971; 058-113-713-450-833; 061-507-800-670-287; 063-207-503-700-767; 068-143-605-669-192; 069-222-611-667-46X; 071-601-864-758-089; 072-975-105-883-930; 073-859-868-800-687; 079-034-689-238-707; 080-357-443-253-546; 081-559-066-309-760; 082-612-601-545-869; 089-627-402-193-481; 091-812-760-612-259; 092-815-192-924-456; 096-835-160-953-686; 098-571-819-798-087; 107-527-494-739-340; 108-857-223-056-60X; 109-162-269-116-845; 109-507-453-904-682; 110-115-299-576-037; 115-742-892-181-305; 116-485-763-851-01X; 120-419-248-919-613; 132-473-320-897-539; 156-624-196-949-616; 158-604-272-738-517; 165-123-901-414-731; 168-592-107-353-063; 176-543-809-298-678; 187-050-769-304-212,33

Sheridan,"Managed riparian forest buffers are an important conservation practice but there are little data on the water quality effects of buffer management. We measured surface runoff volumes and nutrient concentrations and loads in a riparian buffer system consisting of (moving down slope from the field) a grass strip, a managed forest, and an unmanaged forest. The managed forest consisted of sections of clear-cut, thinned, and mature forest. The mature forest had significantly lower flow-weighted concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, total Kjeldahl N (TKN), sediment TKN, total N (nitrate + TKN), dissolved molybdate reactive P (DMRP), total P, and chloride. The average buffer represented the conditions along a stream reach with a buffer system in different stages of growth. Compared with the field output, flow-weighted concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, DMRP, and total P decreased significantly within the buffer and flow-weighted concentrations of TKN, total N, and chloride increased significantly within the buffer. All loads decreased significantly from the field to the middle of the buffer, but most loads increased from the middle of the buffer to the sampling point nearest the stream because surface runoff volume increased near the stream. The largest percentage reduction of the incoming nutrient load (at least 65% for all nutrient forms) took place in the grass buffer zone because of the large decrease (68%) in flow. The average buffer reduced loadings for all nutrient species, from 27% for TKN to 63% for sediment P. The managed forest and grass buffer combined was an effective buffer system.",34,5,1851,1859,Riparian zone; Riparian forest; Nitrate; Ammonium nitrate; Riparian buffer; Buffer zone; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface water,,Chlorides/analysis; Environmental Monitoring/statistics & numerical data; Fresh Water/chemistry; Georgia; Nitrates/analysis; Phosphorus/analysis; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/analysis; Rivers; Trees,Chlorides; Nitrates; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; Phosphorus,,http://lshs.tamu.edu/docs/lshs/end-notes/surface%20runoff%20water%20quality%20in%20a%20managed%20three%20zone%20riparian%20buffer-1275362050/surface%20runoff%20water%20quality%20in%20a%20managed%20three%20zone%20riparian%20buffer.pdf https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2134/jeq2004.0291 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16151237 https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/34/5/1851,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2004.0291,16151237,10.2134/jeq2004.0291,2038963135,,0,002-366-294-773-665; 009-742-460-635-737; 013-158-601-419-635; 015-514-563-181-208; 026-868-019-777-822; 028-802-252-344-012; 030-952-205-937-160; 034-748-846-517-673; 037-647-799-843-260; 038-088-874-218-042; 041-100-362-198-399; 049-435-099-390-089; 052-812-920-178-486; 058-218-489-015-546; 059-320-896-313-943; 059-517-397-699-529; 076-826-572-086-275; 080-589-148-600-106; 082-797-391-654-568; 087-138-533-405-771; 108-531-822-357-682; 115-642-860-718-878; 126-276-377-317-910; 134-191-656-379-548; 139-342-966-894-93X; 141-101-347-131-583; 176-609-653-505-894,76

G. Dollar; Samuel K. Riffell; L. W. Burger,"Butterflies are important components of biodiversity in grassland ecosystems and provide ecosystem services such as pollination. Although agricultural intensification has led to a scarcity of native grassland habitats within most agricultural landscapes of North America, fragmented remnants and semi-natural habitats may support diverse communities, including butterflies, as long as vital resources such as host plants are available. The United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Conservation Reserve Program practice CP33 Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds (USDA 2004) provides semi-natural grassland habitat in agricultural landscapes, but a knowledge gap exists about impacts of prescribed disturbance (e.g. burning or disking) on butterflies. We monitored butterfly habitat and butterfly communities on experimentally manipulated CP33 grassland buffers in Clay County, Mississippi from 2007 to 2009. Disturbance guild butterfly species richness did not differ among treatments. However, disturbance guild abundance was positively affected by disking in both the first and second growing seasons following disking, and the magnitude of this response varied between years. Effects of burning on disturbance guild abundance did not differ from the control treatment. There were no treatment differences for grassland guild butterfly abundance and species richness suggesting that periodic disturbance does not unduly impact grassland-associated butterflies in the southeastern US. Our results support current USDA practice standards that require periodic disturbance during the 10-year contract, but restrict the disturbance to 1/3 or 1/4 of grassland buffer area in a given year.",17,3,577,590,Biodiversity; Conservation Reserve Program; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Disturbance (geology); Butterfly; Species richness; Agroforestry; Guild; Prescribed burn,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10841-012-9543-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-012-9543-7,,10.1007/s10841-012-9543-7,2029477791,,0,003-525-601-982-136; 009-809-485-492-385; 016-352-373-040-903; 017-952-882-487-936; 019-355-665-347-475; 019-622-915-734-27X; 020-908-070-981-920; 020-987-508-366-809; 021-495-086-602-714; 023-874-699-354-293; 027-126-332-563-55X; 027-169-272-591-400; 027-926-257-471-473; 033-321-442-207-32X; 042-303-914-852-499; 044-629-783-838-349; 047-720-803-421-089; 048-448-765-521-05X; 051-587-594-670-509; 056-244-188-471-763; 056-789-845-462-569; 065-687-321-113-981; 069-083-458-833-742; 073-303-999-777-794; 074-728-112-921-258; 078-517-244-526-52X; 079-068-774-342-74X; 080-348-794-816-190; 083-810-224-480-214; 090-461-240-094-453; 090-887-309-314-388; 093-231-388-541-614; 095-104-916-898-838; 099-124-892-577-813; 105-301-641-863-030; 107-258-912-245-333; 108-645-993-103-690; 109-960-300-156-084; 115-537-551-650-895; 117-345-687-903-78X; 118-051-800-470-246; 118-888-746-940-618; 132-653-145-372-847; 137-105-318-357-659; 140-908-676-431-836; 142-494-208-022-818; 142-624-071-999-929; 149-363-740-232-672; 160-534-378-242-887; 161-115-617-014-882; 164-686-630-818-824; 166-234-465-465-118; 169-521-994-083-634; 183-033-307-001-620; 190-841-093-326-161; 197-864-609-077-140,10

The study was based on the comparison of two transects, one with a hedge, the other without, using mainly a dense grid of tensiometers. The influence of the bottomland hedge was located in the area where tree roots were developed, several metres upslope from the hedge, and could be observed both in the saturated and non-saturated zone, from May to December. The hedge induced a high rate of soil drying, because of the high evaporative capacity of the trees. We evaluated that water uptake by the hedge during the growing season was at least 100 mm higher than without a hedge. This increased drying rate led to a delayed rewetting of the soils upslope from the hedge in autumn, of about 1 month compared with the situation without a hedge. Several consequences of this delayed rewetting are expected: a delay in the return of subsurface transfer from the hillslope to the riparian zone, a buffering effect of hedges on floods, already observed at the catchment scale, and an increased residence time of pollutants.

Vegetation performs indispensable functions in the landscape. Protective shelterbelts are important landscape elements. Individual interventions to these ecosystems should be made with the intention to increase the retention capacity of the landscape, the biodiversity, and the stability of individual landscape elements and the landscape as a whole. This article presents the results of the measuring of the effect of model forest vegetation in the proximity of Obelisk in the Lednice-Valtice area on the microclimate. The protective shelterbelt, declared as a forest stand, is located in the cadastral area of Lednice, Podivin and Rakvice. A set of weather stations, supplied by AMET- Litschmann and Suchy Velke Bilovice, was used for the measuring. The stations measured wind velocity (m/s), soil temperature in depths of 5 and 10 cm (°C), air temperature (°C), radiation (W.m<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup>) and precipitation (mm) from January 1 to December 31, 2010. The ImageTool application was used to establish optical porosity, based on photos taken in summer and winter. Optical porosity was established as a ratio of white spots to their total number in a specific section of a photograph. The optical porosity was 5% during the growing season and 23% outside the growing season. These values significantly differ from the optimum values for efficient semi-permeable PS, whose porosity is set to 40-50%.</jats:p>",34,2,101,110,Windbreak; Ecology; Microclimate; Ecology (disciplines),,,,,https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/eko/34/2/article-p101.xml http://sciendo.com/article/10.1515/eko-2015-0011 https://core.ac.uk/display/91689897 https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.1515/eko-2015-0011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/eko-2015-0011,,10.1515/eko-2015-0011,2564649989,,0,000-497-439-605-978; 012-627-784-764-759; 122-130-322-941-794; 123-560-909-981-142,5

Caslick,"The relative importance of 12 variables in explaining the variation in blackbird damage among 50 cornfields located 2-7 km from a large blackbird roost in Cayuga County, New York, was assessed. Date of silking was the most important predictor of bird damage to corn; earlier maturing fields received greater damage. A field's peak population of northern corn rootworm beetles (Diabrotica longicornis) was the second most important variable and was also negatively correlated with bird damage. Other variables of lesser importance were the extent to which a field was bordered by woods and hedgerows and the field's weediness (both positively correlated with damage). Husk extension past the tip of a corn ear was always negatively correlated with blackbird damage within a given field that received higher amounts of bird damage. Because this variable was unimportant in explaining variation in damage among fields, however, we feel that recommending the use of corn hybrids whose bird-resistance is based primarily on husk extension is unwarranted. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 49(4):1109-1115 On a continent-wide basis, blackbird damage to corn is not a serious problem. Less than 1% of the total crop is lost to blackbirds (primarily red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus) in both the United States (Stone et al. 1972) and Canada (Tyler and Kannenberg 1980), whereas insects, weeds, fungi, and diseases combine to reduce potential yield by an average of at least 20% (Jugenheimer 1976:261, Pimental 1976, McEwen 1978, Dolbeer 1980). Blackbird damage to corn, however, is not evenly distributed. Whereas most farmers receive little or no damage, a small proportion of growers suffer severe economic losses (Dolbeer 1981). Although on a regional scale, most of this major bird damage occurs in cornfields located near autumn blackbird roosts (Cardinell and Hayne 1945, Dyer 1967, Martin 1977, Dolbeer 1980), damage levels vary widely even among fields located",49,4,1109,1115,Crop; Ecology; Population density; PEST analysis; Weed; Agelaius; Field corn; Population; Poaceae; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://works.bepress.com/eric_bollinger/49/ https://thekeep.eiu.edu/bio_fac/554/ https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/3801403.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3801403,,10.2307/3801403,2328802514,,0,010-333-012-350-322; 014-712-936-639-180; 014-810-240-013-63X; 028-196-429-731-599; 029-483-944-166-350; 035-960-105-426-701; 045-234-265-891-422; 057-235-948-993-671; 058-005-329-773-453; 062-536-654-582-201; 062-764-912-974-334; 078-011-475-037-653; 079-302-866-023-212; 087-004-320-122-627; 089-587-595-109-384; 105-195-121-925-158; 117-254-407-207-066; 119-322-245-547-344; 124-791-606-344-271; 144-804-142-048-946; 178-543-774-355-507,17

Analyses of N and P budgets in four riparian forests of varying age (two grey alder stands in Estonia and two riparian deciduous forests in USA) show a significant efficiency. Despite the different input load (72.9–110.4 kg N ha −1 year −1 and 2.5–3.0 kg P ha −1 year −1 ), the outputs into streams from the alder stands systems were comparably low (9.0–13.2 and 0.38–0.62 kg ha −1 year −1 ). The older forests from the USA showed less efficiency. Plant uptake of both N and P in younger stands was significantly higher than in older forests. Methods to determine the buffer zones' and buffer strips' width and their efficiency are presented. The testing of efficiency assessment in a watershed in Estonia demonstrated an expected efficiency of buffers.",8,4,299,324,Riparian zone; Riparian forest; Watershed; Riparian buffer; Alder; Deciduous; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Phosphorus; Agroforestry; Forestry,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857497000256,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0925-8574(97)00025-6,,10.1016/s0925-8574(97)00025-6,1986933607,,0,000-142-952-017-146; 002-666-774-347-125; 004-715-851-363-470; 005-964-760-373-589; 006-176-134-679-950; 007-207-212-071-568; 009-379-307-440-518; 009-664-191-327-574; 012-899-875-361-698; 013-388-653-316-893; 014-561-967-561-763; 014-868-282-685-647; 015-514-563-181-208; 017-273-363-576-238; 021-187-528-186-865; 022-216-181-106-913; 022-857-634-363-665; 023-440-997-729-788; 030-234-826-352-089; 030-412-120-540-407; 030-587-602-032-688; 030-987-106-346-912; 034-748-846-517-673; 036-320-750-554-221; 036-413-187-806-647; 038-659-320-814-260; 039-851-151-448-883; 040-066-765-393-233; 040-665-244-257-257; 040-935-957-450-37X; 041-332-783-714-139; 043-840-020-702-07X; 047-368-192-646-86X; 048-683-925-212-185; 053-093-567-362-36X; 053-580-732-478-47X; 055-329-231-017-432; 061-649-023-558-402; 063-965-863-535-497; 064-217-260-116-931; 064-252-055-739-877; 065-821-895-518-368; 066-766-519-764-554; 068-766-032-021-508; 073-779-698-748-600; 074-194-823-339-770; 086-014-193-901-136; 086-998-165-612-358; 087-138-533-405-771; 087-168-688-204-963; 087-238-427-020-892; 088-526-158-902-16X; 091-753-606-308-171; 092-165-704-813-521; 096-268-261-517-009; 098-341-456-303-925; 105-270-727-269-180; 105-652-040-322-583; 106-563-133-017-694; 113-496-738-919-590; 120-589-228-923-094; 120-805-134-581-947; 134-834-860-916-247; 137-813-344-478-275; 137-890-167-917-845; 141-101-347-131-583; 144-712-249-364-633; 150-539-908-471-485; 160-507-474-717-586; 166-198-597-573-588; 173-107-253-973-630; 174-682-969-550-42X; 176-609-653-505-894; 177-770-652-793-529; 186-780-727-063-551; 197-048-190-009-169,166

Raich; Thomas M. Isenhart; Richard C. Schultz,"We quantified rates of soil respiration among sites within an agricultural landscape in central Iowa, USA. The study was conducted in riparian cool-season grass buffers, in re-established multispecies (switchgrass + poplar) riparian buffers and in adjacent crop (maize and soybean) fields. The objectives were to determine the variability in soil respiration among buffer types and crop fields within a riparian landscape, and to identify those factors correlating with the observed differences. Soil respiration was measured approximately monthly over a two-year period using the soda-lime technique. Mean daily soil respiration across all treatments ranged from 0.14 to 8.3 g C m−2 d−1. There were no significant differences between cool-season grass buffers and re-established forest buffers, but respiration rates beneath switchgrass were significantly lower than those beneath cool-season grass. Soil respiration was significantly greater in both buffer systems than in the cropped fields. Seasonal changes in soil respiration were strongly related to temperature changes. Over all sites, soil temperature and soil moisture together accounted for 69% of the seasonal variability in soil respiration. Annual soil respiration rates correlated strongly with soil organic carbon (R = 0.75, P < 0.001) and fine root (<2 mm) biomass (R = 0.85, P < 0.001). Annual soil respiration rates averaged 1140 g C m−2 for poplar, 1185 g C m−2 for cool-season grass, 1020 g C m−2 for switchgrass, 750 g C m−2 for soybean and 740 g C m−2 for corn. Overall, vegetated buffers had significantly higher soil respiration rates than did adjacent crop fields, indicating greater soil biological activity within the buffers.",229,1,117,124,Biomass (ecology); Riparian zone; Soil respiration; Respiration; Water content; Panicum virgatum; Environmental science; Soil carbon; Agroecosystem; Botany; Agronomy,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1004818422908.pdf https://www.sare.org/content/download/50717/666248/LNC00-171_Tufekcioglu_etal_2001_PlantSoil.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1004818422908,,10.1023/a:1004818422908,2098938642,,0,000-826-205-455-14X; 002-937-270-631-538; 007-975-646-070-468; 021-187-528-186-865; 021-310-890-813-156; 022-828-853-975-458; 031-553-286-677-142; 036-469-957-446-549; 036-605-031-156-859; 040-435-668-574-21X; 040-503-634-025-839; 043-019-010-743-677; 051-760-265-462-043; 051-891-286-536-654; 053-128-591-847-700; 060-988-445-475-383; 061-540-606-405-505; 062-801-832-468-925; 072-775-393-220-878; 073-317-562-955-428; 074-896-228-884-885; 076-711-009-855-127; 079-188-532-299-730; 084-741-098-659-917; 084-763-431-224-931; 088-281-977-729-804; 091-711-554-449-398; 093-313-228-416-637; 095-699-197-395-964; 097-162-808-147-613; 100-690-354-401-511; 102-274-227-250-423; 102-448-954-981-166; 111-616-139-900-08X; 121-468-243-703-60X; 121-505-199-767-760; 127-785-284-544-120; 130-372-558-366-361; 132-140-879-332-090; 133-209-049-426-513; 135-693-574-541-341; 141-101-347-131-583; 177-531-308-764-835; 179-393-499-984-266; 180-272-555-475-234; 180-524-585-737-168,154

Dukes; Robert O. Evans; J. W. Gilliam; Sheryl H. Kunickis,"As a result of recent surface water quality problems in North Carolina, riparian buffers and controlled drainage are being used to reduce the loss of nonpoint source nitrogen from agricultural fields. The effect of controlled drainage and riparian buffers as best management practices to reduce the loss of agricultural nonpoint source nitrogen from the middle coastal plain has not been well documented. The middle coastal plain is characterized by intensive agriculture on sandy soils with deeply incised or channelized streams. A 2-year study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of controlled drainage, riparian buffers, and a combination of both in the middle coastal plain of North Carolina. It was hypothesized that raising the water table near the ditch would enhance nitrate-nitrogen reduction through denitrification. On the sandy soils studied, controlled drainage did not effectively raise the water table near the ditch to a greater degree than observed on the free drainage treatment. Due to random treatment location, the free drainage treatment was installed along a ditch with a shallower impermeable layer compared to the impermeable layer on the controlled drainage treatments (2 m versus 3- to 4-m deep). This resulted in a perched or higher water table on the free drainage treatment. Over 17 storm events, the riparian buffer (free drainage) treatment had an average groundwater table depth of 0.92 m compared to 0.96 and 1.45 m for the combination (riparian buffer and controlled drainage) and controlled drainage treatments, respectively. Nitrate concentration decrease between the field wells and ditch edge wells averaged 29% (buffer only), 63% (buffer and controlled drainage), and 73% (controlled drainage only). Although apparently more nitrate was removed from the groundwater on the controlled drainage treatments, the controlled drainage treatment water table near the ditch was not raised closer to the ground surface compared to the free drainage treatment. Nitrate removal effectiveness was attributed to local soil and landscape properties, such as denitrification in deeper reduced zones of the soil profile.",129,2,82,92,Riparian zone; Watertable control; Riparian buffer; Ditch; Hydrology; Environmental science; Well drainage; Soil salinity control; Drainage; Hydrology (agriculture); Environmental engineering,,,,,https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/en/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=200902215427566879 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=323845 https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%290733-9437%282003%29129%3A2%2882%29,http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(asce)0733-9437(2003)129:2(82),,10.1061/(asce)0733-9437(2003)129:2(82),2065878749,,0,002-027-268-565-284; 002-509-409-482-215; 015-213-427-435-243; 015-514-563-181-208; 016-259-935-732-332; 016-886-654-276-361; 021-187-528-186-865; 023-842-569-989-956; 035-157-530-442-048; 040-665-244-257-257; 049-377-460-200-299; 060-049-553-153-247; 063-866-021-105-753; 067-935-774-027-528; 080-589-148-600-106; 087-138-533-405-771; 096-695-870-619-787; 100-845-850-323-114; 102-432-153-097-825; 103-989-366-241-549; 105-270-727-269-180; 123-754-328-151-613; 132-186-585-542-192; 134-860-865-497-079; 141-101-347-131-583; 150-539-908-471-485; 169-607-559-923-667; 173-787-454-724-990; 185-249-332-171-432,22

McMahon; John Whelan; Laura Kirwan; Marcus Collier,"Field boundaries are important habitats for birds within the agricultural landscape. In this study, bird surveys were carried out during the winter and breeding season on nine farms in the east and south-east of Ireland and field boundaries at each site were assessed using the Field Boundary Evaluation and Grading System (FBEGS). Poisson regression demonstrated that FBEGS scores were a good predictor of both winter and breeding bird species richness and diversity within the field boundaries studied. We interpret these preliminary results with caution since our sample size was relatively small (compared to the wide variety of field boundary types found in Ireland) and no single combination of field boundary attributes is likely to be optimum for all bird species. However, our results suggest that FBEGS may be a useful surrogate indicator of overall field boundary bird diversity and we discuss the consequent implications for agri-environmental policy, and for the possible adaptation and use of FBEGS as a tool to monitor the impact of changing farm management practice.",4,,67,77,Physical geography; Seasonal breeder; Agriculture; Sample size determination; Field (geography); Boundary (real estate); Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Species richness; Poisson regression,,,,,https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/handle/10197/3841 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marcus_Collier/publication/215866423_Farmland_birds_and_the_field_boundary_evaluation_and_grading_system_in_Ireland/links/02bfe51126f43c3626000000.pdf https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/10197/3841/1/McMahon_MC_copy.pdf,https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/handle/10197/3841,,,147286398,,0,001-473-384-556-418; 001-852-653-099-092; 002-234-862-186-238; 012-645-250-423-764; 015-198-673-520-248; 016-421-756-148-512; 023-310-699-181-261; 026-162-389-848-750; 029-904-475-177-008; 032-245-730-539-873; 034-922-021-577-840; 050-980-481-048-144; 061-375-521-515-557; 071-601-656-233-384; 072-224-176-896-782; 073-798-803-161-275; 098-291-230-008-197; 105-145-742-902-746; 109-372-232-119-327; 110-766-047-364-379; 120-825-091-224-648; 123-136-805-556-712; 145-770-861-902-890; 156-542-248-199-177; 174-305-346-527-414; 196-154-013-303-271,4

Riddle; Christopher E. Moorman; Kenneth H. Pollock,"Abstract Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations have declined nationally for at least the past 4 decades. Field borders have been promoted as an important component of conservation plans to reverse this decline. Field border characteristics, such as shape and the landscapes in which the borders are established, have the potential to influence their effectiveness for recovering northern bobwhite populations. We established narrow linear (approx. 3-m-wide) and nonlinear field borders on farms in agriculture-dominated and forest-dominated landscapes in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, USA, after collecting pretreatment data on summer bobwhite abundance. After establishment of field borders, summer bobwhite abundance nearly doubled on farms in agriculture-dominated landscapes and increased approximately 57% on farms with nonlinear field borders. Summer bobwhite abundance did not increase on farms with linear field borders in forest-dominated landscapes.

Margin plots were regenerated spontaneously or were sown to grass/forb mixtures and were managed under a cutting regime with removal of cuttings. In general, soil nitrate N, soil ammonium N and soil mineral N losses were significantly affected by distance from the field crop edge and not by plant community type. The further away from the crop edge, the lower soil nitrate (up to fivefold lower than in the crop) was found in the margin strip, but soil ammonium N was approximately 50% higher close to nearby trees and shrubs. Inside the margin strip, total soil mineral N as well as N loss during winter was minimal at a distance of 5 m from the crop edge. The reduction of soil nitrate N near the boundary by the presence of a margin strip was responsible for the increase in abundance of less competitive species and for an up to 20% higher species-richness within the field boundaries. In summary, our results show clearly that margin strips both decrease N pollution of groundwater and increase botanical diversity. A minimal margin width of 5 m is recommended.",26,2,117,126,Vegetation; Cutting; Mineralogy; Nitrate; Ammonium; Soil fertility; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Plant community; Nitrogen; Agronomy,,,,,http://www.agronomy-journal.org/articles/agro/ref/2006/02/a5086/a5086.html https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/369339/file/577081.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/agro:2006004,,10.1051/agro:2006004,2078731305,,0,002-890-902-512-882; 002-937-270-631-538; 008-639-677-997-50X; 009-248-758-733-184; 012-199-449-140-06X; 015-994-616-629-340; 018-219-566-672-229; 020-713-595-267-906; 027-894-701-372-17X; 029-568-331-038-13X; 039-010-174-687-899; 040-105-031-136-536; 041-161-807-605-997; 058-767-657-165-968; 060-212-024-680-436; 087-056-353-958-548; 098-004-631-148-428; 115-343-629-933-751; 115-500-856-921-765; 150-539-908-471-485; 155-909-223-003-504; 161-300-804-429-199; 167-175-414-731-307; 168-228-690-607-508; 186-231-509-533-744,16

Long,"Multispecies riparian buffers (MRBs) are a conservation practice that protects water quality and prevents soil erosion by improving soil quality including aggregate stability, particulate organic matter (POM), and water infiltration. USDA Conservation Reserve Program MRB contracts last 10-15 years; evidence shows MRB soil quality may improve within 3-7 years, but there is little data on how MRB soils perform after contracts typically expire. Slaked soil aggregate stability was measured in a 20-21 year-old MRB in central Iowa at the surface (0-15 cm) and used to calculate the indices mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD), and percent water-stable macroaggregates (%WSA). The MRB contained zones of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L. ‘Cave-inRock’), hybrid poplar (Populus spp.), and cool-season grass; results were compared with an adjacent crop field, a formerly grazed pasture, and a natural riparian forest. Bulk density, total soil carbon, and POM were also measured. A Cornell sprinkle infiltrometer was used to measure infiltration in a 10-year old tree and cool-season grass MRB, and in the switchgrass, cool-season grass and silver maple zones of the MRB used in the soil aggregate study. MRBs were compared with trafficked and non-trafficked crop interrows in a nearby crop field. Perennial vegetation had greater MWD, GMD, %WSA, and total SOC compared to the crop field. Data collected in 1997 showed no significant differences in %WSA or MWD between switchgrass and crop field, but did between cool-season grasses and crop field. However, %WSA and MWD under switchgrass increased 45.8% and 120.5%,",,,,,Riparian zone; Riparian forest; Soil water; Soil quality; Riparian buffer; Panicum virgatum; Silver maple; Hydrology; Environmental science; Soil carbon,,,,,https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5616&context=etd https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/14609/,http://dx.doi.org/10.31274/etd-180810-4162,,10.31274/etd-180810-4162,2341431217,,0,000-933-635-218-121; 002-275-102-975-34X; 002-430-400-638-330; 002-937-270-631-538; 003-753-226-981-725; 007-750-960-169-67X; 014-026-509-704-03X; 017-855-398-848-205; 018-339-500-838-974; 019-556-840-389-594; 022-917-529-917-453; 027-565-001-142-771; 028-802-252-344-012; 031-675-034-536-592; 034-730-675-555-708; 035-994-188-836-938; 038-439-180-047-201; 043-093-142-186-716; 044-982-906-041-039; 045-828-189-511-368; 046-043-670-657-650; 046-822-162-661-680; 048-513-319-982-524; 049-317-539-308-804; 051-473-495-392-528; 054-162-047-302-972; 054-292-788-964-67X; 055-139-812-976-191; 056-214-180-223-83X; 063-468-786-075-695; 063-653-097-885-734; 071-167-876-727-598; 072-547-773-750-024; 073-140-739-304-428; 077-691-773-517-204; 078-586-487-812-183; 082-797-391-654-568; 089-005-441-267-707; 093-906-542-576-026; 098-116-336-933-753; 098-772-217-169-508; 101-774-056-400-814; 104-823-369-426-879; 106-420-178-731-885; 109-858-282-831-697; 113-604-919-002-664; 113-653-670-832-566; 122-193-974-026-944; 123-723-312-423-299; 125-728-684-161-280; 127-785-284-544-120; 128-195-997-346-382; 135-012-152-850-578; 138-885-841-429-916; 142-092-889-852-638; 148-689-314-435-198; 152-129-297-329-586; 164-672-984-388-297; 179-792-835-023-017; 180-524-585-737-168; 185-908-854-688-101,3

There were two treatments: in one treatment, weeds at the margins and inside the plots were regularly controlled by tillage; in the other treatment no weed control was done. Thrips and Orius were sampled by beating faba bean plants and weeds. Orius niger (Wolff) was the most abundant predatory insect species in faba bean and flowering weeds, with numbers of adults and nymphs significantly greater in plots with weedy margins than in weed-free plots. Flowering weeds did not contribute to the abundance of F. occidentalis on faba bean. Abundance of adults of Orius spp. did not coincide with the abundance of F. occidentalis on faba bean or weeds. There were significant negative associations for numbers of Orius spp. among faba bean and the weed species Lamium amplexicaule L. or Sinapis arvensis L. (P < 0.05), indicating movement of Orius individuals from the weeds to faba bean during March–April. Finally, faba bean and weeds may provide some benefits to predators, such as nectar, pollen, shelter and egg-laying sites rather than as sources of insect prey. Cultivation of faba bean could be useful for conservation and augmentation of beneficial insects, including Orius spp. Furthermore, field margins bearing flowering weeds such as S. arvensis and L amplexicaule should be protected against destructive management practices, because they host considerable numbers of the Orius species.",38,4,313,325,Weed; Western flower thrips; Lamium; Thripidae; Anthocoridae; Orius; Orius niger; Vicia faba; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103256124.html https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/2274854 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103256124 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12600-010-0105-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12600-010-0105-9,,10.1007/s12600-010-0105-9,2074305018,,0,002-063-094-679-131; 012-466-311-051-172; 016-808-641-548-125; 017-365-841-676-195; 021-244-291-316-34X; 022-070-333-305-083; 022-268-809-663-032; 025-917-734-600-542; 029-958-158-143-350; 031-579-378-413-334; 036-179-652-303-066; 036-422-725-267-930; 040-182-369-950-331; 042-158-600-314-980; 051-481-215-400-870; 055-047-050-407-161; 056-789-845-462-569; 056-892-630-404-500; 058-508-787-875-371; 060-864-328-865-345; 061-820-185-375-374; 068-343-643-367-116; 072-312-107-731-52X; 074-467-648-217-362; 074-472-331-986-709; 086-569-756-494-810; 086-804-222-037-946; 087-186-786-234-321; 087-437-403-149-36X; 099-328-976-599-74X; 105-581-953-753-067; 117-345-687-903-78X; 128-524-983-758-700; 131-677-528-881-753; 132-797-473-880-640; 136-799-463-802-58X; 142-551-599-351-894; 163-195-143-524-455; 166-103-827-012-555; 177-119-539-550-418,31

Krajewski; Xiaobo Zhou; Matthew J. Helmers,"Summary Characterizing the spatial and temporal variability of small scale runoff responses is essential to distributed hydrologic modeling. To explore the variability of runoff responses, we analyzed surface runoff hydrographs from 12 neighboring hillslopes in central Iowa, USA that were observed for 72 runoff events over a four-year period. These agricultural experimental hillslopes receive various prairie filter strip treatments and drain areas ranging from 0.48 to 3.19 ha. The distances between them vary from tens of meters to about 3 km. We compared the hydrographs from the remaining 11 hillslopes to the hydrograph at the benchmark hillslope (i.e., hillslope B6 with no treatment). The results showed that: (1) for any individual event in which noticeable surface runoff occurred, the hydrographs from these hillslopes had similar shapes but different magnitudes; (2) for any paired hillslopes, the shape similarity persisted, but the scaling factor (the regression slope between two flow series) changed across events; and (3) for any runoff event, no simple relationship exists between the spatial variation of the scaling factor and the slope, slope length, area, and prairie strip width at the footslope of the hillslopes. Interestingly, we found that for 9 out of the 11 paired hillslopes, 40–70% of the temporal variation in the scaling factors can be explained by the antecedent wetness condition and the maximum hourly rain accumulation. These results suggest that the small-scale surface runoff responses are spatially variable but organized linearly, i.e., shape similarity (or linearity) in space is another feature of the small-scale runoff process. This phenomenon seems to result from the spatial vicinity and small-scale spatial variability of rainfall intensity and antecedent soil moisture.",523,,1,13,Runoff curve number; Hydrological modelling; Hydrograph; Common spatial pattern; Runoff model; Filter strip; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Spatial variability,,,,China Scholarship Council,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169415000554 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015JHyd..523....1C/abstract https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153116389,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.01.038,,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.01.038,2075751711,,0,004-465-624-036-972; 006-066-406-396-675; 006-329-950-846-598; 007-677-722-142-043; 008-320-326-223-348; 008-971-380-056-340; 009-780-396-180-412; 010-104-942-454-938; 011-493-172-373-290; 017-930-583-619-831; 019-676-561-924-896; 023-423-073-201-524; 029-742-050-023-063; 030-093-631-991-87X; 030-368-791-861-089; 031-529-836-604-491; 034-393-502-726-631; 036-372-523-897-245; 044-993-084-386-540; 046-140-235-164-24X; 048-106-086-853-933; 049-081-213-291-880; 049-847-868-261-232; 051-172-034-272-006; 052-133-234-984-053; 054-715-809-921-479; 055-192-571-710-917; 060-900-585-984-084; 063-521-010-406-506; 065-315-236-996-946; 067-069-254-382-35X; 067-533-754-673-731; 067-652-033-344-200; 067-705-506-184-662; 069-373-781-508-435; 069-473-047-149-720; 069-803-377-717-240; 070-431-249-324-267; 073-060-264-884-691; 079-233-446-576-041; 084-646-631-268-151; 086-621-201-433-227; 089-906-855-730-210; 092-843-881-158-062; 100-989-960-787-246; 101-486-167-877-192; 104-112-496-691-738; 115-327-011-925-661; 116-061-932-250-460; 119-271-226-592-492; 120-332-902-677-961; 121-638-852-965-268; 122-876-708-988-828; 138-659-345-103-997; 154-158-369-190-671; 159-041-181-557-542; 163-186-925-373-984; 164-778-477-702-099; 167-447-710-673-654; 168-888-939-226-270; 169-167-901-776-708; 171-887-276-660-079; 176-781-779-656-916; 176-965-602-042-093; 181-648-893-047-370; 186-799-475-314-560,3

Helliwell,"Nitrates have been shown to have detrimental effects on both the aquatic environment and on human health, and with the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive beckoning, assessments as to the most appropriate agricultural techniques to minimize the leaching of solutes into surrounding water courses need to be made. Riparian buffer strips are considered an effective means of attenuating concentrated nitrates in agricultural runoff. Whilst a large number of scientific investigations have focused on nitrate removal mechanisms, such as plant uptake and denitrification maximization in buffer zones, few have studied the effects that different soil management treatments have on drainage rates. The application of chloride tracer to soils under six different vegetative treatments from two differing soil textures produced breakthrough curves highlighting the dominant flow mechanisms for each management practice. Of the 18 breakthrough tracers determined, 9 exhibited a rapid macropore hydrology, 6 intermediate mesopore through-flow and three slow micropore flow. Solute breakthrough flow rate was significant between all vegetation and soil treatments (P< 0.05), indicating that both play an important role in the determination of drainage flow pathways and transport speed. Vegetation such as scrub, with a large root network, led to increased soil porosity, significantly increasing the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the maximum peak drainage rates of the soil. On the other hand, maize and grass treatments, with smaller and less dense root networks, exhibited lower soil porosity and hydraulic conductivity, increasing solute residence time within the soil matrix and hence a longer lag time to peak effluent concentration. Although many of the treatments on each soil texture were different, and so could not be directly compared, results suggested that optimal treatments were soil specific, but that grassed and maize buffer strips, on a soil with low saturated hydraulic conductivity, would provide the best compromise at mitigating solute drainage whilst maintaining management practicality.",4,1,79,89,Leaching (agriculture); Leaching model; Soil science; Soil water; Soil texture; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Macropore; Hydraulic conductivity; Soil management,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan_Helliwell/publication/257610486_An_assessment_of_the_nitrate_leaching_risk_for_different_buffer_strip_establishments/links/00b7d5257dca436ad1000000.pdf https://academic.oup.com/biohorizons/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/biohorizons/hzr010 https://paperity.org/p/34395859/an-assessment-of-the-nitrate-leaching-risk-for-different-buffer-strip-establishments https://academic.oup.com/biohorizons/article/4/1/79/239068 http://biohorizons.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/1/79.short,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biohorizons/hzr010,,10.1093/biohorizons/hzr010,2167141367,,0,000-549-090-803-93X; 002-509-409-482-215; 005-938-835-135-552; 006-083-384-428-879; 006-149-152-327-090; 007-004-053-886-726; 007-562-317-521-197; 009-379-307-440-518; 009-734-707-902-332; 013-845-839-283-541; 020-145-060-372-619; 023-889-860-756-398; 024-953-196-350-874; 030-171-471-836-846; 032-534-854-350-184; 036-664-186-194-585; 036-691-351-087-147; 040-533-615-849-901; 043-174-752-205-093; 045-072-492-341-691; 046-281-752-876-770; 047-315-074-139-26X; 055-072-866-441-535; 057-761-750-960-591; 062-305-363-494-940; 075-513-523-284-853; 079-938-824-114-304; 087-273-309-280-750; 088-136-093-994-951; 095-263-397-244-602; 100-148-435-274-753; 101-119-554-728-109; 106-177-292-362-975; 106-728-665-320-283; 108-459-198-531-582; 108-516-754-439-890; 108-525-633-526-407; 111-435-647-398-863; 112-269-099-044-532; 116-056-662-262-050; 121-468-243-703-60X; 125-122-409-294-402; 129-369-314-834-031; 134-281-196-430-419; 141-101-347-131-583; 144-787-876-778-751; 145-679-514-567-429; 150-539-908-471-485; 168-227-494-191-408; 168-390-972-372-263; 169-535-456-005-169; 186-392-345-345-321; 187-955-281-261-673,3

Observations were conducted in the agricultural landscape of Western Volhynia with fields of different land use intensity (a large-scale farming system and small traditional arable fields). The total length of the studied structures was 4760 m and the following five categories of structures were distinguished: field road verges adjacent to large (1) and small fields (2), field margins between the patches of xerothermic grasslands as well as large (3) or small fields (4) and balks (5). The distribution and abundance of species mentioned above were recorded there. The survey showed that linear habitats are not suitable for all the studied species; margins between arable fields and grasslands were the most important habitats for both grassland and weed species. Factors responsible for their abundance and distribution along these margins included the following: type of farming system, exposure of the margin, and soil moisture. Grassland species occupied habitats adjacent to small traditional fields with other than southern exposure; weeds were more abundant in drier microhabitas.",64,4,151,158,Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Grassland; Weed; Melampyrum arvense; Centaurea scabiosa; Euphorbia cyparissias; Arable land; Abundance (ecology),,,,,https://pbsociety.org.pl/journals/index.php/aa/article/view/aa.2011.056/0 https://pbsociety.org.pl/journals/index.php/aa/article/download/aa.2011.056/1145 http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-4b91576c-f1c8-430f-aa13-108e946843e0 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joanna_Czarnecka/publication/257940300_THE_ROLE_OF_LINEAR_STRUCTURES_IN_AGRICULTURAL_LANDSCAPE_IN_THE_MAITENANCE_OF_XEROTHERMIC_SPECIES/links/0046352663de6b3e0d000000.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/229992888.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5586/aa.2011.056,,10.5586/aa.2011.056,2092837257,,0,001-383-595-492-005; 007-243-303-723-240; 012-851-742-943-835; 025-803-636-956-507; 039-248-594-229-122; 043-663-463-772-769; 051-197-969-663-775; 068-452-604-669-157; 085-898-743-572-710; 130-698-554-759-854; 165-123-901-414-731; 180-673-332-400-670; 199-869-896-775-616,1

Gilley; Lisa M. Durso; R. A. Eigenberg; David B. Marx; Brian L. Woodbury,"The effectiveness of a narrow grass hedge in reducing runoff nutrient loads following manure application was examined in this study. Beef cattle manure was applied to 0.75 m wide by 4.0 m long plots established on an Aksarben silty clay loam located in southeast Nebraska. Manure was added at rates required to meet none or the 1, 2, or 4 year nitrogen requirements for corn. Runoff water quality was measured during three 30 min simulated rainfall events. Manure application rate significantly affected dissolved phosphorus (DP) and total phosphorus (TP) loads in runoff on the plots without a grass hedge. However, DP and TP loads were not significantly affected by manure application rate on the plots containing a hedge. The hedge reduced the mean load of DP in runoff from 0.69 to 0.08 kg ha-1 and the load of TP from 1.05 to 0.13 kg ha-1. When averaged across manure application rates, 0.11 kg NO3-N ha-1, 0.02 kg NH4-N ha-1, and 0.49 kg total nitrogen (TN) ha-1 were measured from the plots with a hedge, compared to 0.39 kg NO3-N ha-1, 0.55 kg NH4-N ha-1, and 2.52 kg TN ha-1 from the plots without a hedge. For the plots with a grass hedge, runoff loads of DP and TP where manure was applied were similar to values obtained with no manure application. Each of the runoff water quality parameters was significantly affected by runoff rate. A narrow grass hedge placed on the contour across a hillslope significantly reduced runoff nutrient loads following variable manure applications.",54,3,847,855,Loam; Erosion; Nutrient; Manure management; Water quality; Manure; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Phosphorus; Agronomy,,,,,https://experts.nebraska.edu/en/publications/narrow-grass-hedge-control-of-nutrient-loads-following-variable-m https://core.ac.uk/display/18411486 http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/biosysengfacpub/320/ https://nebraska.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/narrow-grass-hedge-control-of-nutrient-loads-following-variable-m https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1321&context=biosysengfacpub https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/49833 http://elibrary.asabe.org/abstract.asp??JID=3&AID=37110 https://core.ac.uk/download/18411486.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/2013.37110,,10.13031/2013.37110,2089730502,,0,003-232-594-172-08X; 004-543-363-408-491; 009-380-580-545-554; 013-487-233-481-079; 018-306-358-788-396; 028-518-825-078-535; 033-890-182-096-159; 034-748-846-517-673; 044-750-571-884-583; 045-573-628-287-109; 057-131-240-501-938; 059-067-697-517-314; 059-381-194-377-394; 068-432-148-221-069; 069-115-983-163-699; 072-164-353-760-56X; 076-826-572-086-275; 077-380-071-354-756; 087-168-688-204-963; 087-680-309-241-290; 093-915-624-970-603; 097-972-089-803-438; 102-299-231-485-20X; 102-307-069-255-349; 109-888-130-099-932; 109-953-506-304-374; 132-780-346-964-998; 132-949-723-939-343; 141-097-069-585-841; 141-616-290-765-640; 145-628-223-693-935; 154-659-475-372-714; 164-702-330-976-043; 166-648-088-163-172; 192-341-972-259-42X; 197-430-645-554-460,10

In the current study slug numbers and damage were estimated in wildfiower strips and at different distances from the strips into winter wheat crops, from 1994 to 1996. Slug damage was estimated using an index of defoliation and slug numbers and activity were measured using wheat bran traps. Investigations began when winter wheat seedlings emerged and lasted for five weeks. Slug damage was never severe in any of the fields studied. In most fields, slug damage was higher close to the wildfiower strips than at greater distances from the strips. The declining slug damage with increasing distances from the wildflowers strips was related to the distribution pattern of juvenile Arion lusitanicus, suggesting that this species was responsible for the higher damage near the strips. Other slug species (Deroceras reticulatum, Arion fasciatus, Deroceras laeve) were more or less evenly distributed over the field or were almost entirely confined to the wildflower strips. Results showed that winter wheat was not at risk from slug feeding in spite of the establishment of wildfiower strips and that therefore the application of molluscicide along the strips is unnecessary.",64,3,319,328,Wildflower; Molluscicide; Deroceras reticulatum; Arion lusitanicus; Gastropoda; Deroceras laeve; Slug; Arion fasciatus; Botany; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://boris.unibe.ch/115232/ https://academic.oup.com/mollus/article/64/3/319/1012602 https://core.ac.uk/download/212371910.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mollus/64.3.319,,10.1093/mollus/64.3.319,2146584372,,0,007-007-938-839-461; 014-237-527-016-249; 020-767-587-706-87X; 025-911-484-980-097; 026-388-209-802-483; 033-806-559-518-805; 045-490-362-395-896; 058-811-840-420-344; 060-884-804-074-471; 068-953-115-589-565; 086-419-085-554-996; 097-891-727-359-251; 102-287-254-390-301; 102-956-069-257-782; 111-453-087-367-32X,12

Olson; Felix L. Wäckers,"1. Vegetative buffers in agricultural landscapes can provide a range of important ecological services, including conservation of native flora and fauna, enhancement of biological pest control and reduction of agrochemical drift. Typically, studies addressing the impact of such vegetative elements focus on one particular benefit. We investigated whether the benefits of field margins that had been established for conservation of northern bobwhite quail Colinus virginianus populations extended to the enhancement of biological pest control in adjacent conservation tillage cotton fields. 2. Densities of a selection of insect species and the predation and parasitism rates of insect pest species were measured in first- and second-year field margins established for bobwhite quail as well as in an adjacent cotton crop. 3. Second-year field margins yielded higher densities of all species sampled, with the exception of staphylinids and cotton aphids. Despite this, thrips and their predator, Orius insidiosus, were the only species that were also more abundant in the adjacent cotton field. Tachinids and Trichogramma and Lygus species, appeared to prefer the field margin vegetation over the cotton. 4. Overall, the impact of second-year margins on the cotton crop did not significantly differ from first-year margins with regard to pest occurrence or biological control. 5. Analysis of the sugar content in Meteorus autographae, a generalist parasitoid of Lepidoptera larvae, suggested that this species is severely food-limited in the field margins established for bobwhite quail. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that field margins designed to specifically benefit bobwhite quail may be unsuitable for providing other ecological services. By making small adjustments in the vegetative composition of these field margins, such as adding early season nectar-producing plants, it may be feasible to combine biodiversity and pest-control benefits and thereby optimize the overall ecological services to be gained.",44,1,13,21,Biological pest control; Biodiversity; Predation; Ecology; PEST analysis; Orius insidiosus; Lygus; Bobwhite quail; Generalist and specialist species; Biology,,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01241.x/abstract https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01241.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01241.x https://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND43865807 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01241.x https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/2252,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01241.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01241.x,1488919123,,0,012-002-609-721-41X; 012-235-673-330-250; 012-466-311-051-172; 017-002-878-840-590; 017-516-181-294-137; 017-581-185-747-376; 018-028-975-115-624; 022-086-190-125-611; 025-574-204-285-07X; 028-665-201-596-043; 030-398-782-377-559; 031-579-378-413-334; 040-182-369-950-331; 054-274-474-416-858; 054-620-396-640-705; 056-369-646-640-317; 056-675-361-356-182; 056-789-845-462-569; 056-892-630-404-500; 062-036-445-726-722; 065-717-158-017-31X; 070-194-102-378-889; 072-312-107-731-52X; 081-749-104-701-059; 093-974-187-331-263; 097-789-429-598-931; 098-088-417-013-531; 117-345-687-903-78X; 122-948-155-864-541; 128-243-718-753-764; 130-698-554-759-854; 131-453-794-117-51X; 132-569-724-005-273; 147-602-249-669-092; 149-524-960-120-589; 169-099-212-106-248; 176-506-367-701-104; 193-598-530-261-354,180

Linear landscape features such as hedgerows and embankments are conspicuous features of agricultural landscape structure and are important artificial habitats in their own right. However, there has been some debate as to the function of these landscape elements as corridors between larger expanses of semi-natural habitat separated by urban and agricultural habitats. Few studies have specifically studied insect flight responses to linear landscape elements. By observing bumblebee flight behaviour along hedgerows and, by creating a medium-scale experimental array of flower patches using an artificial linear feature, we examined whether such structures can elicit an oriented flight response along them and therefore facilitate insect movement through the landscape. We found that both hedgerows and artificial linear landscape features can influence the flight directions of bumblebees (Bombus spp. Hymenoptera, Apidae), one of Europe’s most important groups of pollinators. A bioassay experiment in which Salvia pratensis (Lamiaceae) was planted into landscape patches with differing numbers of connecting hedgerows showed that this directional response can have a profound effect on plant reproductive success – plants had increased pollinator activity, pollen receipt and subsequent seed set in patches with more connections. The overall hedgerow connectedness of a landscape is therefore important both to bumblebee movement and to those plants which depend on bumblebees for pollination services. Biotic pollination of plants is fundamental to the continued functioning of most terrestrial ecosystems (Kearns",121,4,562,568,Pollinator; Reproductive success; Pollination; Habitat; Ecology; Bumblebee; Pollen; Salvia pratensis; Terrestrial ecosystem; Biology,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19704.x https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/499271 https://pascal-francis.inist.fr/vibad/index.php?action=getRecordDetail&idt=25604190 http://nectar.northampton.ac.uk/3858/ https://pure.northampton.ac.uk/en/publications/landscape-structure-influences-pollinator-movements-and-directly- http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19704.x/abstract https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19704.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19704.x,,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19704.x,2142202244,,0,000-890-614-606-582; 005-474-169-077-617; 006-314-244-124-537; 007-942-930-508-462; 009-361-087-991-944; 013-793-226-953-846; 016-007-160-835-158; 018-049-448-532-648; 018-177-247-655-568; 022-609-146-511-814; 024-440-320-342-342; 025-953-966-792-22X; 026-524-247-263-808; 027-001-115-615-588; 027-625-507-174-190; 032-502-062-020-869; 034-653-724-020-632; 040-635-110-975-715; 041-616-757-175-973; 041-993-716-208-699; 044-778-335-103-807; 044-817-975-333-001; 046-004-550-166-441; 047-949-455-932-004; 048-685-867-122-083; 049-088-413-362-630; 050-328-410-406-314; 050-418-767-246-092; 054-328-419-977-493; 054-455-345-863-62X; 056-515-985-481-050; 059-851-177-532-034; 060-285-372-808-392; 060-292-189-246-868; 061-659-654-152-299; 064-774-143-587-947; 065-315-489-867-683; 065-794-543-594-024; 066-376-824-715-720; 067-277-473-537-389; 068-143-605-669-192; 073-798-803-161-275; 074-109-271-845-800; 076-700-633-118-477; 078-552-001-173-92X; 079-492-501-193-26X; 084-699-123-940-764; 092-256-195-118-777; 092-538-659-846-218; 093-681-866-806-452; 095-186-150-965-057; 096-877-717-512-446; 102-070-713-446-152; 106-411-599-497-05X; 110-250-911-763-923; 112-382-716-397-750; 112-410-864-747-674; 119-209-557-350-650; 122-609-536-222-159; 125-320-593-737-88X; 136-685-028-154-826; 142-624-071-999-929; 144-066-499-137-261; 144-180-531-286-566; 151-610-254-287-042; 153-513-858-008-911; 163-265-300-261-419; 184-061-655-286-989; 187-050-769-304-212; 190-014-601-957-332; 197-230-959-170-770,96

On the windward side of hedgerows species richness and abundance of Orthoptera were reduced (only 4 species were recorded).

Douglas; Juliet A. Vickery; Tim G. Benton,"1. Uncropped field margins are important foraging habitats on farmland for many declining bird species and are a key component of Agri-Environment Schemes across Europe. Maximizing the value of foraging habitats requires detailed knowledge of the factors influencing habitat selection and food availability. 2. We firstly conducted an observational study of foraging habitat selection by breeding yellowhammers Emberiza citrinella L. on lowland mixed farmland, in relation to underlying invertebrate and vegetation characteristics. 3. There was a clear seasonal shift in the relative use of field margins and cereal crops. Margins were used less than crops in late summer, despite supporting higher invertebrate abundance relative to cereals. Seasonal increases in vegetation height were most marked in margins, suggesting the seasonal decline in margin use may reflect reduced food accessibility. 4. In the second phase of the study, field margins were cut experimentally to create short, open patches within taller margin swards. The use of cut patches by foraging yellowhammers increased significantly between early and late summer, and patches were used more frequently with increasing height of adjacent uncut margin. These findings strongly support the theory that tall vegetation reduces margin accessibility in late summer. 5. Synthesis and applications. Provision of invertebrate-rich field margins is a core component of Agri-Environment Schemes, but current prescriptions may result in them having limited value in late summer. More effective management, such as more frequent cutting, may be required to maximize the benefits for foraging birds by creating short, open vegetation patches. Measures to increase accessibility to invertebrates on farmland are likely to benefit a range of bird species across a variety of crop types.",46,2,353,362,Foraging; Vegetation; Habitat; Ecology; Range (biology); Geography; Grassland; Agricultural land; Species richness; Abundance (ecology),,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093095982 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01613.x/full https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01613.x https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20093095982.html https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juliet_Vickery/publication/229475730_Improving_the_value_of_field_margins_as_foraging_habitat_for_farmland_birds/links/5416cafe0cf2bb7347db7286.pdf https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01613.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01613.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01613.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01613.x,2002467839,,0,002-900-720-944-007; 003-251-732-418-644; 005-068-000-072-681; 014-373-326-060-805; 015-691-707-399-917; 018-345-804-742-85X; 028-955-327-048-080; 029-705-760-353-953; 030-831-977-852-027; 032-390-963-080-355; 036-556-226-795-548; 040-889-337-784-868; 044-307-871-990-779; 048-449-850-493-123; 053-787-579-034-941; 060-114-103-966-089; 064-454-510-982-621; 067-557-731-400-673; 068-452-604-669-157; 069-379-822-515-162; 073-935-983-022-480; 074-793-529-288-006; 079-051-208-482-165; 080-139-567-968-521; 080-917-805-094-419; 080-930-934-258-236; 094-746-201-098-704; 116-622-350-649-17X; 119-268-869-323-408; 124-362-582-173-520; 125-995-631-935-63X; 126-051-353-473-137; 126-125-162-266-054; 132-380-117-709-640; 133-858-248-195-498; 143-273-453-722-006; 145-728-200-767-581; 149-200-651-727-319; 165-804-108-473-473; 179-048-991-295-983,111

Klein; William G. Hendrix; Virginia I. Lohr; Jolie B. Kaytes; Rodney D. Sayler; Mark E. Swanson; William J. Elliot; John P. Reganold,"Inspired by international escalation in agricultural sustainability debates, we explored the promise of landscape-scale conservation buffers to mitigate environmental damage, improve ecological function, and enhance scenic quality. Although the ecological benefits of buffer vegetation are well established by plot- and field-scale research, buffer adoption by farmers is limited. Landscape-scale approaches can address several obstacles by simultaneously considering ecological impact, economic efficiency, and aesthetic quality and preference in buffer placement and design. Within four watersheds of Washington’s Palouse farming region, we examined relationships between ecological and aesthetic responses to the existing landscape structure plus three alternative scenarios, differentiated by successive increases in woody buffers. Methodology combined GIS analysis, digital image simulation, soil erosion modeling and mapping, and a landscape preference survey. Landscape ecological function, measured by erosion and deposition rates, improved as buffer elements were added into each successive scenario. Magnitude of improvements varied among scenarios and among watersheds, revealing opportunities for targeting buffers to maximize ecological benefits and economic efficiency. Concurrently, aesthetic preference, measured as scenic quality ratings, increased significantly (p < 0.05) from the existing landscape through the second successive scenario of improved ecological function. No preference difference was found between the second and third scenarios. Results expand current understanding of multifunctional relationships in agricultural landscapes and encourage future research on whether linking ecological and aesthetic quality in buffer design might favorably influence adoption. Results also suggest that, within certain landscape contexts, visually perceivable attributes can provide a relative and coincident indication of ecological function, aesthetic quality, and agricultural sustainability.",134,,195,209,Environmental resource management; Economic efficiency; Agriculture; Functional ecology; Vegetation; Ecology; Geography; Quality (business); Preference; Ecology (disciplines); Ecosystem services,,,,,http://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/47847 https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/47847 https://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/47847 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204614002515 https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_journals/2015/rmrs_2015_klein_l001.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2014.10.019,,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2014.10.019,2007193949,,0,000-438-395-534-628; 002-109-451-134-836; 002-564-451-296-83X; 003-956-788-333-455; 004-469-040-059-36X; 004-978-831-170-174; 006-190-003-301-107; 007-159-731-641-426; 007-187-103-940-845; 008-225-619-668-580; 008-919-831-082-639; 016-586-312-304-276; 016-726-945-276-254; 016-915-486-723-598; 017-928-949-875-985; 018-563-213-979-770; 019-561-810-281-087; 019-622-915-734-27X; 019-744-126-905-254; 024-349-630-562-669; 026-427-794-081-996; 026-610-406-651-156; 028-945-443-615-303; 029-041-643-707-960; 032-693-891-640-330; 033-934-566-627-758; 036-616-049-977-19X; 036-687-682-438-982; 037-962-241-314-722; 040-585-524-939-842; 042-347-872-745-015; 043-060-220-361-751; 050-781-781-385-116; 051-277-218-822-94X; 056-167-842-136-710; 062-819-790-819-509; 064-299-551-482-714; 064-675-123-853-466; 068-789-689-250-577; 069-442-590-018-149; 074-056-936-430-276; 075-714-669-570-749; 079-333-606-008-114; 081-260-270-416-292; 082-851-081-486-92X; 083-621-769-534-507; 083-814-506-960-927; 085-809-299-662-172; 089-365-869-459-178; 091-474-415-919-971; 094-051-260-091-480; 094-818-431-666-21X; 096-992-181-947-700; 098-936-549-472-982; 102-555-702-781-751; 102-894-014-825-833; 106-653-949-616-859; 108-613-888-754-065; 109-313-323-939-363; 113-668-644-899-347; 121-202-493-041-401; 122-982-356-281-130; 125-846-687-685-01X; 127-574-672-341-835; 134-902-235-027-980; 145-306-068-758-097; 148-442-788-421-914; 157-802-642-766-031; 158-108-237-231-187; 158-474-496-337-357; 160-358-768-747-741; 167-042-437-214-370; 169-993-554-881-216; 173-848-232-493-046; 186-304-490-477-90X; 193-405-814-478-48X; 198-743-379-614-419,21

In-stream water and sediment samples that were taken at nine sampling sites of different buffer widths following intense rainfall, and edge-of-field runoff that were sampled in erosion rills were analysed regarding 28 active ingredients of pesticides including copper. In-stream samples contained a mix of 8 ± 4 pesticide compounds, resulting in total pesticide concentrations of 1.4–8.9 μg l−1 for water and 16–670 μg kg−1 dw for sediment. Following an exceptional rainfall event with a previous 34-day drought period, pesticide concentrations reached 7.0–83.4 μg l−1. Fungicides were the most important pesticides found and were significantly correlated with the pesticide application frequency and rate. The calculated toxicity values per sample (TUmax) indicated that both organic pesticides and copper concentrations likely cause ecotoxicological effects in the field. The buffer strip width was of little importance for pesticide in-stream concentrations because pesticide entry occurred mainly via the field path network and erosion rills. Pesticide in-stream concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with the concentrations detected in erosion rills (R2 = 0.56). As possible risk mitigation measures, we suggest the implementation of grassed field paths and vegetated ditches or wetlands.",146,1,81,92,Erosion; Pesticide; Riparian buffer; Pesticide application; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Surface water,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880911003458,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2011.10.010,,10.1016/j.agee.2011.10.010,1987826414,,0,001-021-964-543-19X; 002-192-170-153-563; 002-650-706-842-54X; 007-418-972-781-44X; 009-146-935-743-467; 011-210-426-196-245; 017-949-731-511-057; 017-964-751-911-758; 019-057-578-554-139; 019-622-915-734-27X; 021-655-763-861-159; 021-869-493-155-302; 021-986-678-774-065; 026-689-206-139-259; 026-930-757-954-063; 034-027-979-410-925; 036-132-940-889-059; 036-456-610-975-852; 038-199-952-792-27X; 044-337-654-552-534; 044-401-317-828-273; 045-631-805-817-91X; 046-626-408-470-449; 052-320-986-023-291; 052-589-530-283-548; 052-894-240-545-387; 055-928-057-358-040; 056-030-338-087-481; 056-630-845-564-907; 064-662-281-730-944; 067-546-042-587-563; 068-902-970-555-390; 071-546-547-880-735; 073-293-703-803-249; 075-641-830-306-465; 076-475-205-664-027; 078-834-235-066-428; 084-107-612-630-984; 086-496-072-727-834; 087-680-309-241-290; 102-486-581-051-296; 104-230-077-662-702; 104-437-968-562-754; 114-040-630-292-408; 121-982-818-128-549; 126-075-378-585-481; 128-160-149-056-569; 128-792-299-627-553; 128-968-009-423-197; 129-494-335-321-203; 134-442-996-293-285; 144-806-415-704-267; 155-962-463-938-950; 158-695-500-320-945; 181-090-792-931-175; 199-474-295-456-752,78

Our goal was to identify variables that can explain the variation of earthworm communities across Finnish arable fields by focusing on both regional aspects, such as climate and inherent soil properties, and local aspects, such as field management practices and field margins. We sampled the earthworms during the autumn of 2004 and 2005 at 53 sites of cultivated fields and margins, distributed to 11 localities ranging from the southern parts of Finland to the Arctic Circle. Simultaneously, information was collected on topsoil properties, cultivation history, and climatic factors. We found that soil type was by far the best regional variable to explain the variation in total earthworm density, the density being highest in medium coarse soils, i.e., silts and very fine sands. However, soil type had a significant interaction with soil C:N ratio.

C. Kaspar; Dan B. Jaynes; T. B. Parkin; Thomas B. Moorman,"A significant portion of the NO 3 from agricultural fields that contaminates surface waters in the Midwest Corn Belt is transported to streams or rivers by subsurface drainage systems or ""tiles."" Previous research has shown that N fertilizer management alone is not sufficient for reducing NO 3 concentrations in subsurface drainage to acceptable levels; therefore, additional approaches need to be devised. We compared two cropping system modifications for NO 3 concentration and load in subsurface drainage water for a no-till corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) management system. In one treatment, eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides L.) was grown in permanent 3.05-m-wide strips above the tiles. For the second treatment, a rye (Secale cereale L.) winter cover crop was seeded over the entire plot area each year near harvest and chemically killed before planting the following spring. Twelve 30.5 x 42.7-m subsurface-drained field plots were established in 1999 with an automated system for measuring tile flow and collecting flow-weighted samples. Both treatments and a control were initiated in 2000 and replicated four times. Full establishment of both treatments did not occur until fall 2001 because of dry conditions. Treatment comparisons were conducted from 2002 through 2005. The rye cover crop treatment significantly reduced subsurface drainage water flow-weighted NO 3 concentrations and NO 3 loads in all 4 yr. The rye cover crop treatment did not significantly reduce cumulative annual drainage. Averaged over 4 yr, the rye cover crop reduced flow-weighted NO 3 concentrations by 59% and loads by 61%. The gamagrass strips did not significantly reduce cumulative drainage, the average annual flow-weighted NO 3 concentrations, or cumulative NO 3 loads averaged over the 4 yr. Rye winter cover crops grown after corn and soybean have the potential to reduce the NO 3 concentrations and loads delivered to surface waters by subsurface drainage systems.",36,5,1503,1511,Tile drainage; Sowing; Cropping system; Secale; Tripsacum dactyloides; Cover crop; Environmental science; STREAMS; Agronomy; Drainage,,Agriculture; Environmental Monitoring; Fertilizers/analysis; Iowa; Nitrates/analysis; Nitrogen/metabolism; Poaceae/metabolism; Seasons; Secale/metabolism; Soil; Soybeans; Time Factors; Water Pollutants/analysis; Zea mays,Fertilizers; Nitrates; Soil; Water Pollutants; Nitrogen,CSREES National Research Initiative NRI-CGP; American Farm Bureau Foundation for Agriculture,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17766830 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/17766830 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2006.0468 https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/pdfs/36/5/1503,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2006.0468,17766830,10.2134/jeq2006.0468,2068940626,,0,004-744-238-120-107; 008-853-675-537-793; 008-870-012-400-774; 014-101-731-995-066; 014-634-345-762-231; 015-286-375-308-265; 020-544-447-408-215; 026-608-071-158-083; 045-701-492-592-932; 045-969-854-096-547; 046-121-248-394-294; 053-466-565-369-276; 056-416-602-637-000; 057-932-730-618-389; 062-573-990-568-532; 071-384-818-281-947; 074-339-355-299-88X; 078-913-408-218-65X; 100-984-933-484-634; 109-001-359-972-410; 120-358-579-689-668; 120-443-395-704-778; 125-174-374-832-075; 142-380-807-529-076; 153-537-900-832-813; 170-792-682-067-002; 191-690-623-862-182,172

Arnold; Mark W. Luckenbach; Michael A. Unger,"The use of plastic row covers (plastic mulch) on vegetable farms increases runoff of pesticides after rainfall events and has been linked to toxic events in adjacent tidal waters. In coastal Virginia, USA, runoff from tomato fields with plastic mulch was suspected of causing mortality of commercial hard clam larvae at a hatchery located downstream of farming operations. Concern about the putative impacts of this practice on local waters resulted in a collection of studies to: (1) determine the sensitivity of early life stages of bivalves to copper, a commonly used fungicide; (2) examine acute and chronic biological effects of runoff on tidal creeks; and (3) examine the efficacy of management practices designed to reduce the delivery of pesticides to adjacent creeks. Laboratory bioassays revealed that 48-h LC50 values for embryonic clams Mulinia lateralis and Mercenaria mercenaria were 38 and 20 μg/l, respectively. In situ bioassays with Palaemonetes pugio showed that pulsed toxic conditions sometimes occur downstream of some tomato farms in plastic mulch following rainfall events. Growth, mortality rates and bioaccumulation of copper and organic pesticides in oysters were not correlated with the use of plastic mulch in watersheds. Sediment bioassays indicated potential toxicity in sediment collected downstream of some tomato fields in plastic mulch, but the effects were not consistent between years. Closer examination of management practices on the farms suggests that controlling runoff can prevent toxic impacts. Elevated levels of crop protectants measured at the outflow of farm ponds suggested that they may do little to reduce loadings of some pesticides. However, forested buffer zones and ephemeral sedimentation basins appeared to be effective in reducing pesticide concentrations in runoff and pulsed toxicity in tidal creeks.",298,2,323,346,Pesticide; Bioindicator; Ecology; Hard clam; Mulinia lateralis; Plastic mulch; Surface runoff; Agronomy; Bioaccumulation; Biology; Estuary,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098103003666,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0022-0981(03)00366-6,,10.1016/s0022-0981(03)00366-6,2015637325,,0,002-539-714-623-982; 005-950-665-915-610; 013-969-581-788-909; 017-091-592-409-161; 030-973-634-174-993; 032-779-093-428-148; 033-214-814-010-63X; 037-085-453-562-419; 040-415-570-795-251; 040-745-335-486-565; 045-297-744-458-317; 064-264-469-426-131; 065-460-512-619-452; 067-875-563-020-228; 083-702-756-348-574; 085-418-085-621-748; 088-363-836-079-106; 095-263-397-244-602; 103-864-181-603-225; 104-331-135-098-293; 115-556-282-023-730; 116-509-155-954-924; 145-199-506-693-553; 161-647-220-677-116; 176-481-005-284-747,23

Variability in P-yield was most closely correlated with characteristics of the riparian buffer, such as percent wetland land cover, riparian continuity, and stream sinuosity. During the most extreme events, mean P-yield was negatively correlated with the percentage of wetland land cover in the upland watershed.

Vaissière; Alexis Chevallier; Adrien Rusch,"Abstract Semi-natural habitats (SNH) play key roles for arthropod natural enemy communities in agricultural landscapes. Positive relationship between landscape complexity and biological pest control is now well known and is assumed to mainly come from the fact that natural enemies use semi-natural habitats for overwintering. However, the respective role of each type of semi-natural habitats in the landscape in shaping natural enemy communities and pest control remains poorly studied. Moreover, the relative importance of environmental variables in structuring these communities remains largely unexplored. The main purpose of this study was to provide an insight into the types of SNH natural enemies use for overwintering as well as the effects of local and landscape characteristics in structuring their overwintering communities. Overwintering natural enemy communities were sampled in 7 types of SNH (i.e., forest interior (FI), South-facing forest edge (FES), North-facing forest edge (FEN), dry unmanaged grassland (UGD), wet unmanaged grassland (UGW), managed grass strip (CAP grass strip) either dominated by monocotyledonous plants (MGM) or by dicotyledonous plants (MGD)). Abundance, species richness as well as community composition of each group of enemies were then explained by local and landscape parameters to assess their relative importance. In our study, overwintering natural enemy communities differed markedly among types of SNH. Explanatory variables proved to have a decreasing influence in shaping natural enemy community compositions from the local (i.e. in the emergence trap perimeter, in 3 m- and 15 m-radius circular zones around it) to the immediat landscape (within 30 m- and 60 m-radius circular zones) and then the mid-distant one (within 120 m-, 250 m- and 500 m-radius circular zones). We particularly found that management intensity and vegetation height were very strong drivers of natural enemy diversity at the local scale. Managed CAP grass strips turned out as the main source habitat of beneficials in the spring while forests acted quite negatively on local abundances of most of the beneficials studied. On the opposite, medium arable land and grassland surface areas proved to be favourable for them as a whole in the immediat landscape, while in the mid-distant landscape, fallows favoured aphidophagous hoverflies and arable lands did so for spiders. Our results highlight the need for a more precise description of SNH in the landscape if we are to mechanistically understand the role of compositional landscape heterogeneity on zoophagous arthropod populations and to give relevant guidelines to design landscapes favouring natural biological pest control.",194,,17,28,Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Grassland; Overwintering; Natural (archaeology); Species richness; Ecosystem services; Arable land; Abundance (ecology),,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880914002242 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880914002242,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2014.04.018,,10.1016/j.agee.2014.04.018,2017699807,,0,001-261-565-923-219; 004-472-145-506-143; 008-225-619-668-580; 009-909-414-518-97X; 011-508-246-956-659; 013-439-054-708-024; 013-526-378-431-354; 014-475-770-713-515; 014-953-363-120-759; 016-052-929-723-298; 016-823-705-101-257; 017-516-181-294-137; 021-933-113-017-949; 025-990-754-410-325; 029-433-936-125-211; 029-476-222-336-498; 029-540-327-546-890; 030-012-917-796-79X; 030-605-654-781-361; 040-463-440-362-905; 042-765-344-128-744; 051-586-492-600-425; 053-121-575-080-691; 056-892-041-411-85X; 056-892-630-404-500; 057-326-824-587-341; 057-898-374-057-282; 058-105-561-757-413; 062-036-445-726-722; 063-141-893-182-571; 064-638-334-902-296; 069-901-245-663-534; 070-573-740-499-634; 074-793-529-288-006; 076-863-055-982-955; 087-520-578-895-249; 090-479-535-234-324; 091-265-753-392-171; 091-563-882-813-329; 094-448-753-890-34X; 096-920-887-442-138; 097-095-789-567-42X; 097-540-703-901-873; 109-691-661-850-685; 111-528-391-156-029; 113-124-060-953-420; 113-365-099-387-283; 122-154-985-613-384; 122-505-864-826-289; 122-528-143-728-138; 126-322-219-192-539; 126-812-080-751-085; 137-124-485-341-72X; 140-473-846-131-917; 142-547-556-180-595; 148-203-562-421-657; 150-325-162-873-23X; 192-923-404-596-807; 196-310-671-741-320,70

Matteo Crovetto; Riccardo Falco; Irene Negri; Paolo Siccardi; Giuseppe Bogliani,"Species conservation largely depends on knowledge of habitat needs of target species. GIS-models are increasingly used to assess habitat preferences and distribution of target species, but their accuracy is constrained by availability of digital data layers. We developed a two-steps approach aiming at showing pros and cons of landscape (GIS)- and site-level habitat models, identifying key habitat factors for conservation of a threatened bird species, the red-backed shrike Lanius collurio. A spatially explicit GIS-model was generated using landscape variables, and a second model at site level was developed using fine-scale variables measured on the ground. The GIS-based model was then extrapolated to the entire region to obtain a map of distribution of suitable habitats. Positive associations between shrike occurrence and both hedgerow length and partial shrub cover were detected at both scales. Shrikes were also positively associated with grassland cover at landscape level and with partial cover of untilled herbaceous vegetation at the finer scale, and negatively affected by lucerne cover. The GIS-model led to an affordable map of predicted habitat suitability which should help conservationists to focus on different local priorities, but was unable to identify effects of untilled and lucerne cover. Site-level model gave fine details for habitat management, but its application elsewhere requires ground-measurements of factors. Combining the multiscale models could indicate more urgent actions at large scales (e.g. maintaining suitable habitats, or improving connectivity among isolated patches) and draw a detailed figure of the most suitable habitat for the species. Shrike occurrence was associated with a higher number of shrub and tree species: the indicator value of the species should ensure general benefits for biodiversity from dedicated management.",142,10,2033,2042,Biodiversity; Wildlife conservation; Indicator value; Vegetation; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Threatened species; Shrike; Lanius collurio,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093271902 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320709001682 https://air.unimi.it/handle/2434/146980 https://air.unimi.it/bitstream/2434/146980/2/2009%2c%20GIS-models%20work%20well%20but...%20Lanius%20collurio.pdf https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20093271902.html https://core.ac.uk/download/187845574.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2009.03.033,,10.1016/j.biocon.2009.03.033,1985650400,,0,000-841-882-187-192; 002-641-265-858-604; 004-010-787-386-28X; 007-925-989-089-755; 008-546-788-226-991; 013-241-428-536-287; 014-865-073-229-748; 016-447-341-612-315; 016-534-325-006-054; 026-202-681-573-444; 031-010-458-695-38X; 033-952-435-132-877; 034-237-048-304-353; 035-475-322-624-270; 037-117-841-750-618; 038-133-922-429-902; 039-379-057-982-186; 040-233-755-660-903; 040-742-868-886-250; 044-385-912-335-011; 044-819-263-298-438; 046-462-915-703-966; 051-726-391-428-63X; 055-845-895-107-060; 057-952-034-105-06X; 060-825-366-262-033; 061-720-549-016-471; 064-823-701-071-346; 068-452-604-669-157; 068-896-840-083-964; 072-468-310-648-087; 077-142-531-895-649; 077-277-772-557-227; 081-102-602-184-640; 086-697-181-831-922; 090-882-063-100-802; 094-266-727-720-024; 099-256-885-957-054; 107-150-898-526-934; 107-523-016-693-52X; 120-514-812-606-235; 125-665-410-415-022; 126-531-934-964-578; 141-607-421-854-930; 146-404-989-675-291; 156-066-906-763-397; 165-867-330-917-643; 169-668-099-924-958; 172-810-031-718-739; 184-007-638-596-136; 187-590-829-629-05X,102

Siriwardena; Ira Cooke; William J. Sutherland,"Given likely dramatic land use changes in the UK, there is a need to predict their impact upon biodiversity. Such predictions require an understanding of the habitat factors that determine species' abundances. We relate British farmland bird abundance at the 1 km square scale to three variable sets: landscape composition (for example, areas of woodland, urban and arable), field boundary characteristics and cropping. We then use multi-model inference to summarize model fits for each variable set and compare their explanatory power to identify the relative importance of the three forms of description of the farm landscape. The important variables across species within each set show the habitat features that are most significant for the farmland bird community.; ; Models comprising landscape variables provided the best fits for 21 of 31 bird species, while field boundary variables were most important for seven species and cropping variables for one. After controlling for landscape influences, we then found that field boundary variation was slightly more influential than cropping. These patterns remained when farmland-specialist species were considered alone. This shows that landscapes are the most important determinant of bird abundance and that cropping patterns and field boundary characteristics are influential only within the constraints of landscape structure. However, boundaries and, especially, crops remain important from a management perspective because they are more volatile, and can still drive population change. Important single variables that affected multiple species included woodland (predominantly negative even within farmland-dominated landscapes), hedges with trees (providing nesting habitat and song-posts) and heterogeneity both of landscapes and of cropping (predominantly positive effects). The results indicate which habitat features offer the most scope for induced population changes via management action and potentially provide relationships for input into predictive models with respect to land-use change.",35,2,162,173,Biodiversity; Cropping; Habitat; Ecology; Woodland; Geography; Population; Land use; Arable land; Abundance (ecology),,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2011.06839.x/abstract https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2011.06839.x https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/44675/ https://core.ac.uk/display/77632849,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2011.06839.x,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.2011.06839.x,2126392732,,0,002-262-285-007-84X; 004-010-787-386-28X; 007-416-181-403-689; 008-225-619-668-580; 012-645-250-423-764; 014-373-326-060-805; 021-419-559-384-303; 021-595-556-325-773; 024-616-141-571-410; 025-339-236-906-379; 030-080-840-000-291; 030-831-977-852-027; 032-374-633-920-032; 033-148-196-754-54X; 043-189-832-381-646; 044-307-871-990-779; 044-526-529-402-476; 053-787-579-034-941; 058-608-807-261-050; 059-804-606-271-839; 068-452-604-669-157; 074-225-773-604-407; 074-793-529-288-006; 076-278-055-254-459; 077-277-772-557-227; 077-616-263-319-646; 085-062-158-198-836; 096-009-544-840-942; 100-968-750-753-045; 101-848-247-761-283; 103-385-786-056-06X; 118-809-593-513-720; 122-339-404-455-420; 138-319-486-828-050; 142-659-319-477-877; 156-683-266-497-10X; 163-443-292-660-530; 178-925-055-236-45X,26

Castellano; Randall K. Kolka; Heidi Asbjornsen; Matthew J. Helmers,"a b s t r a c t Reductions of nitrogen (N) export from agricultural lands because of changes in specific N stocks and fluxes by incorporation of small amounts of prairie vegetation strips (PVS) are poorly understood. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the presence and topographical position of PVS on soil and plant carbon (C) and N stocks relative to annual crop and native prairie vegetation. The study was implemented within three small adjacent watersheds, treated with one of the following cover types: (1) 100% row-crop agriculture (CROP); (2) 20% prairie vegetation (PVS) distributed along the contour across three topographical positions: upslope, sideslope and footslope position; and (3) 100% 17-year old reconstructed native prairie (RNP) as the control condition. Total soil organic C (SOC), total soil N (TN), inorganic N availability as indexed by ion exchange resins, N stocks in plant biomass and litter, and the ratio of C3:C4 plant species were measured during the 2010 growing season. Results showed that over five years of treatment, PVS footslope improved soil quality by increasing TN by almost 100% and SOC by 37%; while CROP footslope TN decreased by 31% and SOC decreased by 28%. Overall, N stocks in plant biomass and litter were higher in PVS compared with RNP, except in the footslope where the lower N plant stocks was associated with higher C3 abundance in RNP. Nitrogen availability was higher in CROP (25.4 ± 1.4), followed by PVS (10.2 ± 1.3), and RNP (2.2 ± 1.4); with the highest values recorded in the upslope position for PVS and RNP, and the footslope for CROP. These findings are important for designing watersheds with PVS to reduce N accumulation in the footslope position and promote additional N retention in soil organic",188,,1,11,Biomass (ecology); Crop; Growing season; Vegetation; Soil quality; Litter; Environmental science; Plant litter; Agroecosystem; Agronomy,,,,U.S. Department of Agriculture,https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/47100 https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1283&context=usdafsfacpub https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/47100 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1879&context=abe_eng_pubs https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880914000450 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5324019 https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usdafsfacpub/283/ https://www.fs.fed.us/nrs/pubs/jrnl/2014/nrs_2014_perez-suarez_001.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/33141750 https://works.bepress.com/matthew_helmers/99/ https://srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/47100 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/abe_eng_pubs/598/ https://core.ac.uk/download/33141750.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2014.01.023,,10.1016/j.agee.2014.01.023,2113171980,,0,001-429-934-462-208; 003-148-094-786-550; 005-039-674-874-602; 005-640-255-809-264; 008-870-351-048-365; 009-634-109-530-622; 012-199-787-995-212; 012-932-322-440-072; 015-324-006-812-794; 015-659-056-352-559; 017-922-126-246-099; 018-702-348-958-114; 019-233-648-486-064; 019-622-915-734-27X; 020-737-246-881-680; 025-714-041-289-368; 027-202-865-752-996; 030-322-381-675-052; 030-356-806-220-500; 031-307-226-708-492; 036-417-686-049-052; 036-652-133-156-448; 037-225-006-800-114; 038-335-400-539-341; 038-845-679-812-80X; 043-958-357-694-240; 044-401-317-828-273; 045-703-481-504-676; 052-247-228-180-177; 054-288-712-689-913; 063-709-043-459-166; 065-252-642-384-536; 065-894-269-020-543; 066-520-877-286-652; 077-732-163-909-639; 077-783-077-763-346; 080-540-517-488-299; 080-547-551-267-117; 081-666-088-340-957; 085-001-581-213-889; 089-139-100-447-826; 092-412-054-182-97X; 098-976-760-362-486; 102-901-034-424-714; 107-541-440-753-017; 108-347-348-160-611; 115-987-772-510-78X; 118-802-906-666-129; 120-015-544-225-56X; 126-961-510-728-424; 127-768-499-173-49X; 132-397-715-162-287; 157-834-905-259-231; 164-778-477-702-099; 172-591-410-755-92X,19

Gilley; Bahman Eghball; David B. Marx,"The placement of stiff-stemmed grass hedges on the contour along a hillslope has been shown to decrease nutrient transport in runoff. This study was conducted to measure the effectiveness of a narrow grass hedge in reducing runoff nutrient transport from plots with a range of soil nutrient values. Composted beef cattle manure was applied at dry weights of 0, 68, 105, 142, and 178 Mg ha -1 to a silty clay loam soil and then incorporated by disking. Soil samples were collected 243 days later for analysis of water-soluble phosphorus (WSP), Bray and Kurtz No. 1 phosphorus (Bray-1 P), NO3-N, and NH4-N. Three 30 min simulated rainfall events, separated by 24 h intervals, were then applied. The transport of dissolved phosphorus (DP), total P (TP), NO3-N, NH4-N, total nitrogen (TN), runoff, and soil erosion were measured from 0.75 m wide × 4.0 m long plots. Compost application rate significantly affected soil measurements of WSP, Bray-1 P, and NO3-N content. The transport of DP, TP, NO3-N, NH4-N, TN, runoff, and soil erosion was reduced significantly on the plots with a grass hedge.

Schoonover; Karl W. J. Williard; James J. Zaczek; Jean C. Mangun; Andrew D. Carver,"Nutrients in overland flow from agricultural areas are a common cause of stream and lake water quality impairment. One method of reducing excess nutrient runoff from non-point sources is to restore or enhance existing riparian areas as vegetative buffers. A field scale study was conducted to assess the ability of remnant giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea (Walt.) Muhl.) and forest riparian buffer zones to attenuate nutrients in agricultural surface runoff from natural precipitation events. Two adjacent, 10.0 m wide riparian buffers were instrumented with 16 overland flow collectors to monitor surface runoff for nitrate, ammonium, and orthophosphate. Measurements were taken at 3.3 m increments within each buffer. The forest buffer significantly reduced incoming dissolved nitrate-N, dissolved ammonium-N, total ammonium-N, and total orthophosphate masses in surface runoff by 97, 74, 68, and 78 , respectively within the 10.0 m riparian buffer. Nutrient reductions within the cane buffer were 100 for all three nutrients due to relatively high infiltration rates. Significant reductions of total ammonium- N and total orthophosphate were detected by 3.3 m in the cane buffer and at 6.6 m in the forest buffer. Results suggest that both giant cane and forest vegetation are good candidates to incorporate into riparian buffer restoration designs for southern Illinois as well as in other regions within their native range with similar climatic and physiographic conditions.",64,2,169,180,Riparian zone; Nutrient; Riparian forest; Nonpoint source pollution; Ecology; Arundinaria gigantea; Riparian buffer; Buffer zone; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10457-004-0294-7.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-004-0294-7,,10.1007/s10457-004-0294-7,1982057753,,0,005-046-617-641-306; 007-751-667-195-881; 014-561-967-561-763; 019-293-917-776-188; 019-630-402-616-34X; 024-201-741-123-940; 028-802-252-344-012; 029-294-447-653-235; 034-748-846-517-673; 038-439-180-047-201; 040-935-957-450-37X; 044-401-317-828-273; 048-513-319-982-524; 058-218-489-015-546; 066-015-967-377-681; 066-657-263-745-372; 076-826-572-086-275; 078-395-809-984-737; 082-797-391-654-568; 086-190-138-130-44X; 088-017-310-971-747; 088-236-621-248-724; 089-340-644-881-887; 101-774-056-400-814; 111-288-588-656-115; 115-642-860-718-878; 115-864-182-852-341; 137-827-292-132-666; 141-101-347-131-583; 164-890-850-952-468; 169-607-559-923-667; 171-831-215-685-94X; 175-843-619-559-572; 176-609-653-505-894; 199-427-715-730-630,89

Fisher; Pierre-André Jacinthe; Philippe Vidon; X. Liu; Matthew E. Baker,"Riparian buffers are important nitrate (NO) sinks in agricultural watersheds, but limited information is available regarding the intensity and control of nitrous oxide (NO) emission from these buffers. This study monitored (December 2009-May 2011) NO fluxes at two agricultural riparian buffers in the White River watershed in Indiana to assess the impact of land use and hydrogeomorphologic (HGM) attributes on emission. The study sites included a riparian forest in a glacial outwash/alluvium setting (White River [WR]) and a grassed riparian buffer in tile-drained till plains (Leary Weber Ditch [LWD]). Adjacent corn ( L.) fields were monitored for land use assessment. Analysis of variance identified season, land use (riparian buffer vs. crop field), and site geomorphology as major drivers of NO fluxes. Strong relationships between N mineralization and NO fluxes were found at both sites, but relationships with other nutrient cycling indicators (C/N ratio, dissolved organic C, microbial biomass C) were detected only at LWD. Nitrous oxide emission showed strong seasonal variability; the largest NO peaks occurred in late spring/early summer as a result of flooding at the WR riparian buffer (up to 27.8 mg NO-N m d) and N fertilizer application to crop fields. Annual NO emission (kg NO-N ha) was higher in the crop fields (WR: 7.82; LWD: 6.37) than in the riparian areas. A significant difference ( < 0.02) in annual NO emission between the riparian buffers was detected (4.32 vs. 1.03 kg NO-N ha at WR and LWD, respectively), and this difference was attributed to site geomorphology and flooding (WR is flood prone; no flooding occurred at tile-drained LWD). The study results demonstrate the significance of landscape geomorphology and land-stream connection (i.e., flood potential) as drivers of NO emission in riparian buffers and therefore argue that an HGM-based approach should be especially suitable for determination of regional NO budget in riparian ecosystems.",43,1,338,348,Environmental chemistry; Ecosystem; Riparian zone; Riparian forest; Nutrient cycle; Flooding (psychology); Riparian buffer; Ditch; Hydrology; Environmental science; Alluvium,,,,USDA-NRI,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25602568/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25602568 https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/pdfs/43/1/338 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/25602568 https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/43/1/338 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2013.06.0223,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2013.06.0223,25602568,10.2134/jeq2013.06.0223,2042260697,,0,014-032-281-123-044; 014-311-447-815-481; 015-008-874-237-705; 021-264-049-632-756; 024-545-401-295-702; 025-412-899-715-184; 031-580-108-193-755; 031-662-075-850-219; 031-988-523-433-612; 038-915-129-340-87X; 042-220-297-354-721; 043-409-146-184-986; 043-876-635-952-758; 053-274-552-170-122; 060-139-646-563-121; 065-397-517-303-861; 068-308-610-693-130; 070-761-446-166-95X; 072-055-346-731-151; 080-589-148-600-106; 082-848-132-695-426; 085-080-272-017-495; 088-175-727-127-094; 090-235-500-995-608; 099-748-767-096-16X; 111-606-443-415-864; 119-438-959-503-268; 125-265-266-266-583; 133-674-479-125-669; 137-330-269-608-386; 170-939-487-720-479; 176-658-844-592-805; 187-367-993-326-489,20

The purpose of this study is to characterize the morphology and distribution of sediments deposited in a restored riparian forest that were transported from adjacent areas cropped with sugar-cane. In order to study the deposition processes in a riparian forest located in the county of Iracemapolis state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, soil samples were collected on a transect for micromorphological as well as particle size distribution analyses, using Folk & Ward statistical parameters. Soil samples were dispersed with NaOH + sodium hexametaphosphate and water. The dispersion in water was made to simulate field transport conditions. Particle size distributions together with field and laboratory morphological analyses showed an irregular and non-uniform sediment deposition. This deposition process suggests the occurrence of high intensity erosive events that produce high amount of sediments and runoff characterized by a turbulent flow. The land use change in the riparian area marks the change in the preferential deposition location, which when sugar-cane dominated, corresponded to the alluvial plain and, after the restoration and development of the riparian forest, was dislocated 27 m upslope within the first few meters from the border of the forest.",64,5,486,494,Riparian zone; Riparian forest; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; Alluvial plain; Surface runoff; Soil test; Deposition (geology); Transect,,,,,http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0103-90162007000500006 http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0103-90162007000500006&lng=pt https://www.revistas.usp.br/sa/article/view/22277 http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&pid=S0103-90162007000500006&lng=es&tlng=pt https://www.revistas.usp.br/sa/article/download/22277/24301,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/s0103-90162007000500006,,10.1590/s0103-90162007000500006,2119740537,,0,018-668-638-487-019; 031-827-669-158-791; 036-195-745-523-906; 047-315-074-139-26X; 049-475-788-951-167; 050-964-118-348-919; 053-889-770-791-913; 058-688-652-615-370; 069-455-526-693-759; 073-922-830-905-247; 074-298-988-620-823; 083-988-894-588-265; 088-526-158-902-16X; 091-475-758-046-708; 095-690-349-139-484; 111-435-647-398-863; 111-627-781-466-667; 112-797-180-131-923; 115-655-675-948-869; 118-185-229-533-300; 119-983-731-986-551; 123-511-814-673-39X; 134-495-328-719-518; 164-937-766-905-015,6

Gillespie; B.K. Miller; K.D. Johnson,"Abstract Growing concern for non-point source pollution in agricultural watersheds has generated alternative agronomic practices such as filter strips that minimize off-site movement of farm chemicals and sediment. Guidelines for establishment of filter strips in the Midwest region of the US are few with respect to the interplanting of fine hardwood tree species that can provide additional income to farm owners as well as site protection. This study was undertaken to discern the effects of different herbaceous cover types on tree growth and survival when interplanted. Ladino clover ( Trifolium repens L.) and orchardgrass ( Dactylis glomerata L.) were sown and seedlings of three tree species, green ash ( Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh.), black walnut ( Juglans nigra L.), and red oak ( Quercus rubra L.) were planted within each cover type to examine the performance of these integrated cover-tree systems. A series of plots containing the native mix of annual and perennial weed species was used as a control. Height and stem caliper of the trees were taken for 4 years. Additionally, habitat quality for bird species was assessed with respect to the corn ( Zea mays L.) crop the filter strips replaced. Results indicated that cover type had little influence on tree growth and survival when weed control adjacent to seedlings was effective. Compared with the native weed population, clover and grass covers allowed equal height growth of trees, providing no greater competition but higher management costs. For habitat quality, filter strips provided better habitat for birds when compared with corn. Thus, the construction of filter strips with tree species along streams or drainage ditches can take several forms that can serve to filter excess nutrients and sediment.",53,3,263,270,Woody plant; Weed control; Plant cover; Weed; Trifolium repens; Dactylis glomerata; Population; Cover crop; Environmental science; Agroforestry; Agronomy,,,,,https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND20624338 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19950615208 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167880994005772,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0167-8809(94)00577-2,,10.1016/0167-8809(94)00577-2,2059651736,,0,015-514-563-181-208; 020-947-336-118-991; 038-659-320-814-260; 047-315-074-139-26X; 068-061-324-831-836; 073-432-011-180-092; 075-323-170-284-198; 075-781-408-578-136; 087-138-533-405-771; 097-972-089-803-438; 105-270-727-269-180; 111-435-647-398-863; 125-374-860-270-502; 141-101-347-131-583,16

Aihartza; Inazio Garin; Javier Zabala,"In a previous study on habitat use by Rhinolophus euryale in an Atlantic area (Northern Iberian Peninsula), this bat species foraged exclusively in woodland, including both native deciduous woodland and exotic plantations. As the study was carried out in a landscape that was profoundly altered by industrial forestry, we predicted that in a better preserved landscape this species would select smaller feeding areas located at closer distances from the roost, according to the optimal foraging theory, and would use almost exclusively the preferred habitat, i.e., native deciduous woodland. To test these hypotheses, we radiotracked 14 R. euryale from the largest known breeding colony of northern Iberian Peninsula and determined their habitat selection, spatial foraging pattern, and hunting behaviour. Our predictions on habitat selection, as well as on the foraging site size and on commuting range were confirmed.

Davey; Juliet A. Vickery; Nigel Boatman; Dan E. Chamberlain; Gavin M. Siriwardena,"Capsule Hedgerows and margins managed under agri‐environment schemes appear to attract greater numbers of some farmland bird species. Aims To examine fine‐scale habitat associations of farmland birds to determine whether Entry Level Stewardship, the wider countryside agri‐environment scheme for England, provides a mechanism for affecting population changes. Methods Ninety‐seven 1‐km squares in East Anglia were surveyed to create two‐dimensional habitat maps showing the location of all habitat patches and associated stewardship management. Modified territory‐mapping techniques were used to produce relative estimates of bird numbers within each discrete habitat patch within each square. The effect of Entry Level Stewardship on species density was then analysed using glms. Results Boundaries managed under Entry Level Stewardship appeared to attract higher densities of Blue Tits, Dunnocks, Common Whitethroats and Yellowhammers. Margins managed under the scheme also had higher densities of Yellowhammers.

Their presence affected weed assemblages in the boundaries and over the first metre of the field margins as well as the patterns of weed species distribution. Sown grass strip effect always significantly explained the weed species assemblage in boundaries (23.6%), crop edges (28.4%) and field margins (8.1%) but not in field cores. Sown grass strips enlarged the habitat of boundary species ( Plantago lanceolata , Arrhenatherum elatius , Carex sp.). They limited the spread of some species into the field (e.g. Sonchus asper , Anagallis arvensis ). Some species were favoured by the establishment of sown grass strips (e.g. Cirsium arvense , Bromus sp., Elytrigia repens ). However, sown grass strips acted as a buffer zone for arable species ( Alopecurus myosuroides , Viola tricolor , Capsella bursa-pastoris ), preventing them to extend their habitat from the fields to the boundaries. With short-term consideration, the establishment of sown grass strips puts areas of arable land aside, but offers an opportunity for many plant species to enlarge their habitat without increasing weediness.",155,,35,40,Species distribution; Weed; Arrhenatherum elatius; Carex; Bromus; Cirsium arvense; Elytrigia; Alopecurus myosuroides; Botany; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880912001405,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2012.03.022,,10.1016/j.agee.2012.03.022,2086592338,,0,000-669-594-539-024; 011-508-246-956-659; 012-335-108-074-344; 027-644-607-239-338; 029-251-161-036-602; 032-961-767-789-531; 059-280-274-716-779; 060-708-377-821-918; 063-141-893-182-571; 063-308-044-981-354; 065-071-886-701-523; 073-865-623-324-417; 074-013-046-940-514; 078-152-796-237-76X; 083-412-860-749-866; 085-052-391-228-772; 085-894-135-330-699; 096-741-165-038-973; 099-921-237-201-045; 100-409-714-530-783; 104-824-287-195-100; 112-331-812-531-454; 113-365-099-387-283; 115-537-551-650-895; 133-048-738-071-733; 146-624-555-178-452; 151-368-087-827-60X; 153-761-167-883-963; 161-300-804-429-199; 167-175-414-731-307; 169-228-174-821-424; 196-695-939-802-308,18

Guber; Alexander Yakirevich; Ali M. Sadeghi; Yakov Pachepsky; D. R. Shelton,"Vegetated filter strips (VFS) have become an important component of water quality improvement by reducing sediment and nutrients transport to surface water. This management practice is also beneficial for controlling manure-borne pathogen transport to surface water. The objective of this work was to assess the VFS efficiency and evaluate the uncertainty in predicting the microbial pollutant removal from overland flow in VFS. We used the kinematic wave overland flow model as implemented in KINEROS2 coupled with the convective-dispersive overland transport model which accounts for the reversible attachment-detachment and surface straining of infiltrating bacteria. The model was successfully calibrated with experimental data obtained from a series of simulated rainfall experiments at vegetated and bare sandy loam and clay loam plots, where fecal coliforms were released from manure slurry applied on the top of the plots. The calibrated model was then used to assess the sensitivity of the VFS efficiency to the model parameters, rainfall duration, and intensity for a case study with a 6-m VFS placed at the edge of 200-m long field. The Monte Carlo simulations were also performed to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the VFS efficiency given the uncertainty in the model parameters and key inputs. The VFS efficiency was found to be <95% in 25%, <75% in 23%, and <25% in 20% of cases. Relatively long high-intensity rainfalls, low hydraulic conductivities, low net capillary drives of soil, and high soil moisture contents before rainfalls caused the partial failure of VFS to retain coliforms from the infiltration excess runoff.",38,4,1636,1644,Loam; Infiltration (hydrology); Water content; Water quality; Filter strip; Hydrology; Manure; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Surface water,,"Calibration; Enterobacteriaceae/isolation & purification; Models, Theoretical; Monte Carlo Method; Plants; Uncertainty; Water Microbiology",,,https://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/ad_hoc/12655300EnvironmentalTransport/STWIR_reprints/jeq-38-4-1636.pdf https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/38/4/1636 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2008.0328 https://msu.edu/~akguber/files/STWIR/jeq-38-4-1636.pdf https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80420525/EnvironmentalTransport/STWIR_reprints/jeq-38-4-1636.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19549940 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/19549940 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/download/31757/PDF https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093247011 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/31757,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2008.0328,19549940,10.2134/jeq2008.0328,1994634509,,0,000-073-950-100-003; 000-473-351-643-13X; 000-521-240-880-638; 001-168-995-099-307; 007-850-000-698-097; 011-751-968-011-964; 013-446-432-560-502; 017-171-643-071-851; 020-188-845-767-450; 024-686-342-544-391; 026-434-734-570-195; 032-226-381-470-99X; 033-881-668-870-349; 038-580-087-999-964; 041-734-577-789-422; 053-514-836-557-388; 055-204-862-812-935; 055-488-793-301-441; 064-560-673-923-65X; 064-655-278-564-572; 066-714-492-024-42X; 067-559-517-600-50X; 070-377-273-331-446; 076-436-701-138-403; 076-826-572-086-275; 103-154-083-684-408; 105-796-662-135-478; 111-288-588-656-115; 112-700-431-523-654; 115-460-127-924-989; 127-751-427-061-826; 128-320-740-075-409; 148-511-377-828-599; 151-498-245-092-772; 151-755-829-769-77X; 166-604-449-988-782; 172-848-836-166-883; 182-906-730-748-020; 195-277-143-877-584,36

J. Krutz; Scott A. Senseman; Kevin J. McInnes; David A. Zuberer; Dennis P. Tierney,"Adsorption and desorption of atrazine and its metabolites in vegetated filter strip soil (VFS) has not been evaluated, yet these data are needed to predict the transport of these compounds through the VFS. Adsorption and desorption parameters for atrazine, desethylatrazine (DEA), deisopropylatrazine (DIA), and hydroxyatrazine (HA) were compared between a cultivated Houston Black clay (CS) and an adjacent 12-year-old VFS established in a mixed stand of bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] and buffalograss [Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt. Engelm)]. Adsorption and desorption isotherms were determined by batch equilibrium. The evaluated chemical and physical properties of the VFS and CS were similar with the exception of a 1.7-fold increase in the organic carbon content of the VFS. Adsorption and desorption coefficients for atrazine were at least 59% higher in VFS than in CS. The adsorption coefficient for HA was 48% higher in VFS compared with CS, but desorption was not statistically different between soils. Adsorption and desorption coefficients for DEA and DIA were not statistically different between soils. The predicted order of mobility in CS is HA < atrazine = DIA = DEA. In VFS, the predicted order of mobility is HA < atrazine = DIA < DEA. These data indicate that the higher organic carbon in VFS will likely retard the transport of atrazine and HA to surface and ground waters; however, the transport rates of DEA and DIA will be similar between soils.",51,25,7379,7384,Environmental chemistry; Adsorption; Total organic carbon; Soil water; Desorption; Chemistry; Cynodon dactylon; Atrazine; Filter strip; Soil contamination,,"Adsorption; Agriculture; Atrazine/chemistry; Chemical Phenomena; Chemistry, Physical; Herbicides/chemistry; Poaceae/growth & development; Soil/analysis; Triazines/chemistry","6-chloro-N-ethyl-1,3-5-triazine-2,4-diamine; Herbicides; Soil; Triazines; desethylatrazine; Atrazine",,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jf0348572 https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf0348572 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14640587 http://www.ars.usda.gov/sp2userfiles/place/64022000/publications/krutz/krutzetal.2003a.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf0348572,14640587,10.1021/jf0348572,2156230679,,0,002-735-040-373-216; 003-685-139-253-496; 005-046-617-641-306; 009-742-460-635-737; 012-045-264-184-304; 013-653-385-493-985; 017-397-083-522-184; 021-822-493-556-01X; 022-043-597-750-558; 024-998-467-249-663; 025-167-489-777-474; 027-305-363-358-472; 028-307-418-063-870; 029-227-515-568-324; 033-003-427-448-201; 034-195-159-242-383; 035-805-034-490-449; 036-673-850-253-745; 036-746-107-081-582; 036-915-831-698-190; 039-776-092-630-409; 040-594-372-324-05X; 050-475-431-512-845; 055-442-435-256-00X; 057-235-393-043-874; 060-203-623-587-829; 064-391-295-893-021; 075-027-223-325-971; 084-832-446-427-308; 089-381-031-525-610; 094-049-137-663-313; 103-148-967-328-600; 103-286-115-762-912; 109-615-719-908-946; 111-288-588-656-115; 111-770-657-246-810; 133-363-147-232-814; 134-840-824-387-852; 135-362-570-889-037; 140-291-848-621-795; 167-029-801-740-064; 169-120-654-024-227; 175-950-958-362-911; 178-140-173-536-98X; 183-809-836-623-56X,41

Features of hedgerows of importance to individual species are examined. Some 97% of the total 3042 mammals captured were wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus, yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis, bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus and common shrew Sorex araneus. Small numbers of harvest mice Micromys minutus, field voles Microtus agrestis, pygmy shrews Sorex minutus and water shrews Neomys fodiens were also caught. Wood mouse, the most numerous species, showed a typical pattern of large numbers in autumn and winter, followed by a simultaneous decline over all hedges in early spring. Population changes were less clear in yellow-necked mouse and bank vole but the yellow-necked mouse was more scarce in the second year of study. Common shrews were most numerous in summer and declined rapidly in autumn. Hedgerow coppicing had a marked effect on yellow-necked mouse numbers but not on wood mouse. In an extensive survey of mammal numbers in relation to hedgerow features, ground cover was found to be the single largest factor influencing size of bank vole populations.

046-726-236-405-904,INFLUENCE OF HABITAT ON DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF THE EASTERN WOODRAT IN KANSAS,,2001,,,,,,Jon P. Beckmann; Glennis A. Kaufman; Donald W. Kaufman,"Anthropogenic modification of native woodlands and grasslands in the Great Plains has altered the abundance and distribution of many species of mammals. To study habitat effects on the eastern woodrat (Neotomafloridana), we surveyed nests of the eastern woodrat in woodlands, grasslands, and croplands along 77 km of secondary roads in three counties in north-central Kansas. All nests were located in woodlands (~2% of habitat), although grasslands and croplands consti- tuted 36% and 62% of habitat surveyed, respectively. In our survey, nests were associated positively with shelterbelts (3.6 nests per 100 m of road edge) but not with shrub patches (1.1 nests per 100 m of road edge) or riparian woodlands (0.3 nests per 100 m of road edge). Consequently, we specifically censused nests in an additional 12 riparian woodlands and 12 shelterbelts. Nests of eastern woodrats were less dense in riparian wood- lands (9.4 nestslha) than in shelterbelts (55.5 nestslha). Density of woodrat nests decreased as width of a wooded area increased. Further, nests per 100 m of length of woodland did not increase as the width of woodland increased. These patterns suggest that woodland edge, not woodland interior, is the primary factor in abundance of eastern woodrats in this region. Although the eastern woodrat has previously been consid- ered a woodland species, our results suggest that this assessment is incorrect. Our observations demonstrate that anthropogenic modifica- tion of the Great Plains, in the form of planted shelterbelts and expanded riparian woodland, likely has increased the distribution and abundance of eastern woodrats, compared to the mid-1800s.

The experiment aimed to maximize botanical diversity and was conducted at two different locations with contrasting soil type and comprised four vegetation types (spontaneously regenerated versus sown vegetation) and three herbage removal strategies (herbage left versus herbage removed). The experimental factors investigated were location, vegetation and herbage removal. Margin strips were mown twice a year with a late first cut around 15 June and a regrowth cut around 15 September to meet nature conservation objectives. Average DM yield over the first three years was not significantly affected by herbage removal but increased significantly over time, irrespective of vegetation or herbage removal. Initially, sown margin strips significantly outyielded unsown margin strips, but differences in DM yield converged over time. The mid-June cut yielded significantly more than the regrowth cut but its herbage quality was significantly lower. Herbage from the unsown margin strip had a significantly better forage quality than herbage from sown margin strips. Forage quality decreased over time, irrespective of location or vegetation. Changes over time in DM yield and quality were attributed to changes in species composition. The herbage quality of field margins was lower than the herbage quality of intensively managed grassland, limiting its use in rations for highly productive livestock.",54,1,37,60,Biomass (ecology); Ecological succession; Soil type; Vegetation; Grassland; Forage; Dry matter; Environmental science; Agronomy; Field experiment,,,,,https://library.wur.nl/ojs/index.php/njas/article/view/666 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1573521406800035 https://library.wur.nl/ojs/index.php/njas/article/download/666/474,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1573-5214(06)80003-5,,10.1016/s1573-5214(06)80003-5,2155731792,,0,001-529-507-963-663; 002-133-301-281-873; 003-708-957-298-353; 005-739-414-714-562; 009-434-580-802-224; 010-259-439-178-143; 012-227-103-279-895; 015-245-558-797-363; 015-518-876-533-372; 023-491-446-926-013; 024-675-577-150-57X; 032-678-954-256-34X; 032-752-705-056-729; 034-841-488-643-923; 038-623-323-979-226; 039-451-650-093-615; 056-641-336-386-093; 082-407-432-481-039; 091-245-616-066-064; 125-550-027-862-84X; 128-760-888-268-265; 158-755-038-003-756; 161-300-804-429-199; 166-542-102-822-213; 167-175-414-731-307; 171-084-509-728-013,13

Croxton; Claire Carvell; J. O. Mountford; Tim H. Sparks,"There have been major changes in agricultural practice over the past 50 years. The increasing efficiency of arable production has led to larger field sizes with the associated removal of many hedgerow field boundaries. This, together with high input farming practices, has had a deleterious effect on the quality of the rural landscape as a wildlife habitat. This study focuses on green lanes, that is, trackways bounded on both sides by hedgerows, and the adjacent field margins of arable crops and examines each habitat to determine their relative resource value to bumblebees. The vegetation communities within 15 green lane sites and those of the adjacent field margins were recorded, and subsequent analysis showed that species richness was significantly higher within the green lanes. Bee numbers were recorded at each site during 10 visits, both along the inside of green lane hedges and the outside of the opposite hedge on the field margins of the arable crops. At each visit the flower abundance of 10 plant groups was recorded for each habitat type. The results show that bumblebee abundance was significantly higher within the green lane habitat than on the field margins and that this difference was directly related to the abundance of flowers within the habitat.",107,3,365,374,Vegetation; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Bumblebee; Plant community; Species richness; Agroecosystem; Arable land; Abundance (ecology),,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320702000745,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0006-3207(02)00074-5,,10.1016/s0006-3207(02)00074-5,2034322514,,0,001-215-876-773-222; 002-890-902-512-882; 004-468-911-725-66X; 004-960-850-452-585; 020-074-979-227-411; 022-918-260-400-877; 039-885-186-600-094; 044-616-246-113-964; 047-949-455-932-004; 048-543-721-099-075; 050-418-767-246-092; 053-551-700-281-485; 055-107-013-670-19X; 059-361-082-177-816; 061-874-562-554-057; 077-563-394-178-760; 077-623-747-437-53X; 083-275-013-425-723; 105-466-690-006-049; 133-321-379-438-402; 146-652-412-549-031; 167-728-003-906-501; 196-154-013-303-271,41

Chapman; Christine A. Ribic,"Abstract The practice of continuously grazing cattle along streams has caused extensive degradation of riparian habitats. Buffer strips and managed intensive rotational grazing (MIRG) have been proposed to protect and restore stream ecosystems in Wisconsin. However, the ecological implications of a switch from traditional livestock management to MIRG or buffer strip establishment have not been investigated. Differences in small mammal communities associated with riparian areas on continuously grazed and MIRG pastures, as well as vegetative buffer strips adjacent to row crops, were investigated in southwestern Wisconsin during May–September 1997 and 1998. More species (mean of 6–7) were found on the buffer sites than on the pasture sites (mean of 2–5). Total small mammal abundance on buffer sites was greater than on the pastures as well; there were 3–5 times as many animals on the buffer sites compared to the pasture sites, depending on year. There were no differences in species richness or total abundance between MIRG and continuously grazed pastures in either year. Total small mammal abundance was greater near the stream than away from the stream, regardless of farm management practice but there were no differences in species richness. Buffer strips appear to support a particularly rich and abundant small mammal community. Although results did not detect a difference in small mammal use between pasture types, farm-wide implications of a conversion from continuous to MIRG styles of grazing may benefit small mammals indirectly by causing an increase in the prevalence of pasture in the agricultural landscape.",88,1,49,59,Riparian zone; Ecology; Managed intensive rotational grazing; Grazing; Buffer zone; Pasture; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Species richness; Abundance (ecology),,,,,https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usgsstaffpub/522/ http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1531&context=usgsstaffpub https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70024891 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880901001542,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-8809(01)00154-2,,10.1016/s0167-8809(01)00154-2,2006547533,,0,005-073-055-538-326; 010-083-294-693-008; 012-338-039-886-640; 014-322-432-919-02X; 018-982-083-333-790; 026-652-453-307-433; 028-455-082-855-472; 029-067-159-542-004; 034-461-301-281-56X; 035-093-656-083-327; 040-198-568-662-726; 051-751-437-557-117; 052-407-380-233-819; 057-191-112-701-980; 059-573-097-010-175; 062-840-277-915-897; 063-314-964-834-008; 064-592-044-575-740; 068-824-335-098-900; 068-997-932-046-194; 073-466-062-049-161; 075-781-408-578-136; 077-260-437-651-741; 080-104-280-558-672; 083-292-483-412-825; 090-434-065-856-305; 105-658-519-498-107; 105-670-059-365-224; 106-011-783-545-979; 106-184-521-213-152; 109-440-424-327-317; 118-670-885-675-090; 135-116-340-737-691; 141-005-140-982-524; 162-119-967-627-958; 164-502-760-111-254; 194-566-776-043-947,41

Smith; Randall K. Kolka; Xiaobo Zhou; Matthew J. Helmers; Richard M. Cruse; Mark D. Tomer,"Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) constitutes a small yet important part of a watershed’s carbon budget because it is mobile and biologically active. Agricultural conservation practices such as native perennial vegetation (NPV) strips will influence carbon cycling of an upland agroecosystem, and could affect how much DOC enters streams in runoff, potentially affecting aquatic ecosystems. In a study conducted in Iowa (USA), four treatments with strips of NPV varying in slope position and proportion of area were randomly assigned among 12 small agricultural watersheds in a balanced incomplete block design. Runoff samples from 2008 to 2010 were analyzed for DOC and correlated with flow data to determine flow weighted DOC concentrations and loads. Data were analyzed for the entire 3 years, annually, seasonally, monthly, by flow event size and for one extreme storm event. Overall we found few differences in DOC concentration with the exception that concentrations were greater in the 10 % NPV at the footslope watersheds than the 20 % NPV in contours watersheds over the 3 years, and the 100 % agricultural treatment had higher DOC concentrations than all NPV treatments during the one extreme event. Because the NPV treatments reduced runoff, DOC export tended to be highest in the 100 % agricultural watersheds over the 3 years and during high flows. We also compared two watersheds that were restored to 100 % NPV and found decreases in DOC concentrations and loads indicating that complete conversion to prairie leads to less watershed DOC export. Regression results also support the contention that increases in the percentage of NPV in the watershed decreases watershed export of DOC. Further analysis indicated that DOC concentrations were diluted as flow event size increased, independent of any treatment effects. It appears groundwater sources become an important component to flow as flow event size increases in these watersheds",120,1-3,121,132,,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/38933233.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-014-9985-y,,10.1007/s10533-014-9985-y,,,0,002-165-731-296-107; 007-596-631-763-587; 008-540-892-409-627; 009-176-472-166-794; 019-101-472-887-416; 025-714-041-289-368; 026-896-461-248-526; 029-320-338-955-169; 029-730-485-734-552; 033-505-125-164-529; 037-301-351-122-686; 050-504-109-016-472; 050-917-785-504-987; 051-591-893-072-025; 055-192-571-710-917; 055-204-529-273-19X; 056-572-672-082-930; 060-823-075-227-01X; 062-966-709-615-112; 065-440-575-574-011; 068-718-714-883-109; 072-176-462-420-749; 079-766-506-556-512; 085-586-483-418-844; 087-487-011-023-886; 089-111-314-444-327; 111-288-588-656-115; 118-802-906-666-129; 127-896-643-251-429; 133-138-314-955-26X; 164-778-477-702-099; 168-424-180-911-647; 171-364-373-892-645; 190-786-354-858-141; 197-403-936-641-667,9
047-647-835-437-685,Strip‐management in rape crop: is winter rape endangered by negative impacts of sown weed strips?,1996-01-12,1996,journal article,Journal of Applied Entomology,09312048; 14390418,Wiley-Blackwell,United Kingdom,A. Hausammann,": With crop rotation as a fundamental element of the IPM and organic production, crop plants and their pests change beside permanent sown weed strips. Rape pests which are known to populate the fields from the edges might be augmented by sown weed strips. To evaluate whether weed strips have a negative impact on rape crop, insect pests and their antagonists were studied in a winter rape field near Berne, Switzerland, divided into two parts by a sown weed strip. They were registered at different distances from the weed strip and from the opposite field boundary in 1993. The pollen beetle Meligethes sp. and the cabbage weevils Ceutorhynchus assimilis Payk., C. napi Gyll. and C. pallidactylus Marsh and the brassica pod midge Dasineura brassicae Winn. were significantly more frequent near the field boundary than in the middle of the field and close to the sown weed strip. This could be because a sown weed strip does not act as a real field edge. For the investigated rape pods, little difference was observed as to the rate of infestation of C. assimilis. It was astonishing that only a few predators were caught by sweep netting in the whole field as well as close to the weed strip. A higher number of parasitoids near the sown weed strip could not be found either, which was probably due to their high mobility. The low rate of parasitization of the rape pests was only once assessed clearly higher near the weed strip than in the rest of the field. Therefore, flower visiting predators and parasitoids might not have been efficiently increased the weed strip. Generally, no negative impact of the weed strip on rape crop was found and therefore sown weed strips could be suitable areas in a farming with crop rotation to diversity an agroecosystem.",120,8,505,512,Crop; Crop rotation; Predation; Weed; Infestation; Pollen beetle; Netting; Agroecosystem; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0418.1996.tb01643.x,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0418.1996.tb01643.x,,,1968106127,,0,003-558-486-358-493; 018-174-584-116-166; 021-199-110-991-742; 030-337-991-259-189; 034-794-654-751-665; 038-862-413-181-46X; 060-884-804-074-471; 064-893-774-544-494; 072-817-046-222-302; 084-387-070-806-39X; 160-321-842-724-056,16

Spruill,"Water-quality and hydrologic information were collected along ground-water flow paths from two well-drained and two poorly drained Coastal Plain settings in North Carolina to evaluate the relative effectiveness of riparian buffers in reducing discharge of nitrate to streams. At one well-drained site with a 100 m buffer, little or no effect was detected on surface-water quality by discharging ground water because extensive woody vegetation in the buffer was able to take up not only most nitrate, but also most ground water before discharging to the stream during the growing season (March-October). At the second well-drained site, ground water discharging to the stream from the side with a buffer contained about 2 mg/L of nitrate-nitrogen after passing through the bed of the stream compared to 6 mg/L in ground water discharging from the side with no buffer. In the poorly drained settings, nitrate in ground water decreased from about 6 mg/L in the recharge area to less than 0.02 mg/L downgradient from the riparian buffer. Ground water discharging from the side with no buffer contained 0.83 mg/L.

Ottens; M.W. Kuiper; Heiner Flinks; J. van Ruijven; Henk Siepel; B.J. Koks; Frank Berendse; G.R. de Snoo,"To help restore food availability for birds, arable field margins (extensively managed strips of land sown with grasses and forbs) have been established on European farmland. In this study we describe the effect of field margins on the diet of Eurasian Skylark nestlings and adults living on intensively managed Dutch farmland. We tested the hypotheses that field margins offer a higher diversity of invertebrate prey than intensively managed crops, and that the diet of nestlings receiving food from field margins will therefore be more diverse than that of other nestlings. Field margins had a greater variety of invertebrate prey groups to offer than the intensively managed crops. Coleoptera were the most frequently and most abundantly eaten prey group by both adults and nestlings. Together, Coleoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Araneae accounted for 91% of the nestling diet. Nestlings ate larger prey items and a larger proportion of larvae than adults. Almost 75% of both adults and nestlings consumed plant material, perhaps indicating a scarcity of invertebrate resources. When provided with food from field margins, the mean number of invertebrate orders in the nestling diet increased significantly from 4.7 to 5.5 and the number of families from 4.2 to 5.8 per sample. Thus, birds that used field margins for foraging could indeed provide their young with more invertebrate prey groups than birds only foraging in crops and grassland.",102,2,161,174,Seasonal breeder; Invertebrate; Forb; Foraging; Predation; Ecology; Grassland; Alauda; Arable land; Biology,,,,,http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/483288 https://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.5253/arde.v102i2.a6 https://alibenalimedical.com/ar/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d9%86%d8%aa%d8%ac%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b7%d8%a8%d9%8a%d8%a9/?_amc-currency=EUR https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/135447 https://core.ac.uk/display/29208639 https://www.bioone.org/journals/ardea/volume-102/issue-2/arde.v102i2.a6/Do-Field-Margins-Enrich-the-Diet-of-the-Eurasian-Skylark/10.5253/arde.v102i2.a6.short https://core.ac.uk/download/43574675.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5253/arde.v102i2.a6,,10.5253/arde.v102i2.a6,2149439773,,0,000-421-021-678-271; 003-251-732-418-644; 006-635-819-665-420; 007-416-181-403-689; 010-153-861-561-556; 012-357-805-545-268; 014-373-326-060-805; 014-512-098-254-76X; 016-304-499-713-011; 017-286-878-574-20X; 024-757-248-573-212; 031-592-787-048-258; 031-711-171-352-744; 032-503-420-126-941; 035-137-631-422-742; 039-968-931-574-898; 040-022-260-080-448; 043-162-709-545-086; 043-960-023-606-573; 044-307-871-990-779; 045-112-935-895-815; 046-513-869-126-279; 048-811-604-053-498; 049-977-293-677-848; 056-299-820-246-884; 058-569-963-310-089; 064-297-474-959-451; 064-454-510-982-621; 068-452-604-669-157; 072-635-809-451-975; 074-225-773-604-407; 075-168-083-087-797; 075-491-486-540-39X; 076-278-055-254-459; 076-863-055-982-955; 092-495-483-378-627; 092-623-904-467-147; 098-280-416-936-449; 100-318-421-276-204; 106-631-772-110-395; 108-017-982-903-556; 108-265-136-728-042; 108-432-135-453-978; 109-961-489-035-909; 114-197-508-325-494; 120-380-603-948-991; 123-653-571-393-994; 124-079-930-184-362; 125-995-631-935-63X; 133-858-248-195-498; 134-797-888-874-528; 140-095-431-029-376; 140-736-672-644-414; 145-728-200-767-581; 147-888-609-293-647; 149-200-651-727-319; 159-870-981-574-031; 163-015-818-947-376; 165-804-108-473-473; 172-676-927-461-150; 179-048-991-295-983; 198-540-410-315-987,1

They are part of rural landscapes and should not be studied without considering the farming systems and the rural society as a whole. Their species composition depends on the history of the countryside, as well as current farming practices. Land use and boundary management play a major role in determining the floristic composition of hedgerows, and are strongly related to the grain size of the field's mosaic. Hedgerow networks, due to their rectilinear shape, and with their high degree of connection, enhance or interrupt many fluxes in the landscape. Hedgerows act as a corridor of movement and dispersal for many forest species, such as carabids, small mammals, and plants. On the other hand, hedgerows interrupt or slow down air fluxes and the propagules they carry. In the heterogeneous mosaic of fields and wooded patches, hedgerows often increase the functional connectivity of rural landscapes.

The effects of windbreak on maize yields have not been assessed in a well-documented manner in eastern Canada, which is a major influential barrier limiting their adoption by farmers. In this study, we investigated the spatial distribution of maize grain yield in the leeward side of mature (average age, 30-years-old) single-tree row windbreaks that were located on four farm sites in southern Quebec, Canada. We determined whether the sign and magnitude of windbreak effects on spatial patterns of maize yield varied across contrasting years with respect to rainfall conditions. The greatest yield variation was observed at the tree-crop interface (within 0.5–1H, where H = tree height), where substantial yield reductions occurred. In two sites, the magnitude of negative windbreak effects on maize yield at the tree-crop interface decreases in the wetter years. We found important maize yield variation among sampling positions between 2H and 20H (here considered as the shelter zone), with yield values often significantly higher than at 24H (here considered as a control zone with negligible tree shelter effects). The magnitude of this yield variation in the shelter zone generally decreased in the wetter years. In most cases, we estimated that the net effect of windbreak on maize yield (0.5–20H vs. 24H) was negligible. Significant net positive (16 %) or negative (−6 %) effects of windbreaks on maize production were found at one site only and occurred on two different years. We conclude that the sign and magnitude of windbreak effects on spatial patterns of maize grain vary considerably across farms and depend upon temporal variation in rainfall conditions in eastern Canada.",89,2,237,246,Agriculture; Climate change; Windbreak; Spatial ecology; Range (biology); Spatial distribution; Tree shelter; Environmental science; Yield (finance); Agronomy,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-014-9758-6 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-014-9758-6/fulltext.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-014-9758-6,,10.1007/s10457-014-9758-6,1980323512,,0,001-880-733-649-611; 002-809-658-530-016; 004-533-043-348-064; 006-897-297-708-277; 014-860-657-526-903; 019-490-805-815-106; 022-648-804-684-488; 022-937-199-811-282; 023-954-927-032-027; 031-022-354-105-259; 035-221-894-319-394; 035-309-970-742-503; 035-907-485-723-237; 037-074-496-819-014; 041-491-650-483-638; 042-226-353-542-004; 042-660-969-184-235; 043-601-624-212-321; 044-623-657-378-698; 045-905-213-685-568; 047-587-843-500-208; 047-829-881-468-850; 048-756-412-031-981; 073-686-055-991-794; 077-742-542-965-592; 078-152-162-481-023; 078-649-327-618-934; 086-962-625-574-037; 110-391-230-565-525; 114-765-340-699-400; 122-130-322-941-794; 134-269-264-906-609; 146-536-127-705-703; 159-881-385-105-590; 168-744-090-896-896; 169-537-758-448-861; 186-417-477-225-485; 191-559-831-813-250; 191-699-801-657-570,12

Burgess; Jenny A. Bright; Antony J. Morris; Rob H. Field; Philip V. Grice; Andrew I. Cooke; Will J. Peach,"Conserving farmland birds is a key objective for agri-environment schemes (AES) across Europe, with a number of management options aimed at providing invertebrate food and nesting habitats. We analysed territory settlement by two widespread but declining farmland buntings with contrasting nesting requirements: the Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella, a boundary-nesting species, and the Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra, a ground-nesting species. The study was conducted on farms participating in the English Higher Level Stewardship scheme to test whether territory settlement is influenced by the provision of key arable AES options. Both species settled preferentially in localities containing sown arable field margins, while Corn Bunting also settled in localities containing nectar flower mixtures. These preferences are likely to reflect foraging rather than nesting habitat requirements. Yellowhammer selected territories containing hedgerows under AES management, which are nesting rather than foraging habitat but may also provide food. Uptake by land owners of several AES options likely to provide limiting resources for farmland birds was very low, and because uptake at the landscape scale is also low, wider-scale population level benefits are likely to be constrained. However, this is one of few studies demonstrating selection of widely applied arable AES options by breeding farmland birds.",156,1,153,163,Agriculture; Foraging; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Emberiza; Corn bunting; Yellowhammer; Emberiza citrinella; Agroforestry; Arable land,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10336-014-1113-1/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10336-014-1113-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-014-1113-1,,10.1007/s10336-014-1113-1,2066146100,,0,000-074-703-336-072; 002-262-285-007-84X; 002-845-097-888-509; 002-989-142-190-816; 003-460-280-575-85X; 007-194-033-627-161; 011-195-141-573-323; 011-305-198-094-715; 011-693-938-201-836; 012-645-250-423-764; 014-373-326-060-805; 016-421-756-148-512; 019-913-894-404-641; 020-131-452-110-549; 027-068-264-288-767; 028-955-327-048-080; 029-705-760-353-953; 030-831-977-852-027; 032-390-963-080-355; 036-117-863-979-556; 038-255-983-206-134; 042-082-544-198-293; 043-009-269-441-396; 043-159-873-957-616; 043-583-117-779-984; 044-307-871-990-779; 045-455-587-148-315; 049-771-162-087-705; 050-261-844-716-21X; 050-343-478-975-666; 051-174-178-095-618; 054-543-464-986-374; 056-099-523-856-735; 058-089-327-815-315; 058-416-961-649-911; 059-649-458-440-049; 060-210-993-352-731; 061-472-431-665-855; 062-125-673-660-15X; 064-022-545-449-473; 064-454-510-982-621; 067-912-727-549-225; 071-369-356-792-041; 073-359-404-037-66X; 073-798-803-161-275; 073-935-983-022-480; 074-225-773-604-407; 075-065-731-918-471; 076-278-055-254-459; 077-537-180-667-797; 083-381-011-024-36X; 094-746-201-098-704; 096-101-436-780-075; 096-497-658-401-644; 097-123-929-736-172; 105-145-742-902-746; 107-532-685-702-969; 108-367-697-659-208; 108-602-646-468-855; 114-978-955-592-537; 116-622-350-649-17X; 126-051-353-473-137; 126-684-590-662-783; 140-524-158-870-625; 145-728-200-767-581; 159-938-497-832-818; 166-801-044-851-502; 176-218-987-199-331; 176-962-359-944-180; 181-602-781-774-289; 187-603-367-498-373,10

Christensen; Maliha S. Nash; Anne C. Neale,"Within the Southeastern (SE) Coastal Plain of the U.S., numerous freshwaters and estuaries experience eutrophication with significant nutrient contributions by agricultural non-point sources (NPS). Riparian buffers are often used to reduce agricultural NPS yet the effect of buffers in the watershed is difficult to quantify. Using corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) and model averaging, we compared flow-path riparian buffer models with land use/land cover (LULC) models in 24 watersheds from the SE Coastal Plain to determine the ability of riparian buffers to reduce or mitigate stream total nitrogen concentrations (TNC). Additional models considered the relative importance of headwaters and artificial agricultural drainage in the Coastal Plain. A buffer model which included cropland and non-buffered cropland best explained stream TNC (R2 = 0.75) and was five times more likely to be the correct model than the LULC model. The model average predicted that current buffers removed 52 % of nitrogen from the edge-of-field and 45 % of potential nitrogen from the average SE Coastal Plain watershed. On average, 26 % of stream nitrogen leaked through buffered cropland. Our study suggests that stream TNC could potentially be reduced by 34 % if buffers were adequately restored on all cropland. Such estimates provide realistic expectations of nitrogen removal via buffers to watershed managers as they attempt to meet water quality goals. In addition, model comparisons of AICc values indicated that non-headwater buffers may contribute little to stream TNC. Model comparisons also indicated that artificial drainage should be considered when accessing buffers and stream nitrogen.",52,5,1161,1176,Riparian zone; Watershed; Current (stream); Coastal plain; Eutrophication; Riparian buffer; Land cover; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science,,"Agriculture/methods; Conservation of Natural Resources/methods; Eutrophication; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Nitrogen/analysis; Rivers/chemistry; Southeastern United States; Water Pollution, Chemical/prevention & control",Nitrogen,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23989318 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013EnMan..52.1161C/abstract https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00267-013-0151-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-013-0151-4,23989318,10.1007/s00267-013-0151-4,2089158655,,0,000-426-413-797-854; 002-025-980-590-185; 002-840-898-558-515; 003-148-094-786-550; 004-125-888-575-805; 006-101-014-623-163; 006-361-934-755-848; 008-482-016-572-798; 008-686-460-522-572; 008-985-146-954-457; 012-164-768-754-675; 014-401-057-001-692; 014-890-012-480-765; 015-213-427-435-243; 015-961-075-985-447; 016-053-060-230-167; 016-231-311-085-267; 016-467-809-725-98X; 017-944-190-097-742; 019-007-567-403-591; 019-352-485-651-177; 020-743-769-551-091; 021-210-817-386-575; 022-987-216-088-782; 023-145-313-075-604; 023-895-239-856-690; 026-277-780-259-895; 027-838-371-096-734; 029-294-447-653-235; 032-279-298-922-886; 034-672-033-342-943; 037-680-619-731-97X; 041-606-538-207-737; 042-798-851-167-183; 044-948-727-495-773; 046-119-640-494-924; 046-292-313-541-673; 049-773-451-909-567; 049-875-994-559-898; 051-269-697-269-175; 051-573-390-526-866; 051-693-167-860-956; 052-583-140-294-949; 053-020-046-628-735; 053-325-923-141-337; 056-026-806-439-061; 057-447-331-351-497; 059-363-675-295-331; 065-350-164-143-20X; 066-031-983-790-740; 072-474-208-707-598; 073-060-264-884-691; 075-199-264-474-157; 075-797-196-953-286; 076-391-726-216-619; 077-276-214-647-717; 080-015-964-028-221; 082-852-563-985-603; 083-619-701-060-090; 085-809-299-662-172; 086-812-018-054-941; 087-138-533-405-771; 088-363-836-079-106; 089-676-415-540-084; 090-675-218-770-834; 091-774-201-173-558; 095-263-397-244-602; 096-992-699-821-977; 097-407-778-530-744; 101-605-603-531-171; 102-215-497-936-230; 105-219-145-526-489; 106-850-460-264-15X; 107-345-679-359-283; 110-419-567-105-817; 110-588-214-484-417; 116-886-192-455-802; 118-617-405-400-694; 120-077-022-215-130; 122-334-917-035-12X; 123-283-063-699-529; 123-607-505-428-901; 126-961-510-728-424; 130-272-804-781-141; 130-949-480-723-560; 135-661-469-317-536; 136-705-253-190-554; 142-671-675-236-406; 156-217-128-534-55X; 157-459-970-526-162; 160-278-852-111-578; 168-149-351-696-563; 176-785-973-569-670; 177-904-011-066-242; 180-937-238-219-054; 183-820-433-241-206; 184-154-617-361-696; 190-027-017-517-824; 192-216-725-631-092; 195-618-519-387-640,14

Wäckers; Delia M. Pinto,"1. The use of flowering vegetation has been widely advocated as a strategy for providing parasitoids and predators with nectar and pollen. However, their herbivorous hosts and prey may exploit floral food sources as well. 2. Previous laboratory studies have shown that not all flower species are equally suitable in providing accessible nectar. Relatively little is known about actual nectar exploitation under field conditions. 3. The present study investigates nectar exploitation by the pest, Plutella xylostella, and its parasitoid, Diadegma semiclausum, under field conditions and examines whether floral nectar exploitation in the field can be predicted based on controlled laboratory studies. 4. Insects were collected from fields bordered by flowering margins containing Fagopyrum esculentum, Lobularia maritima, Anethum graveolens, Centaurea jacea or the grass Lolium perenne (control). Whole insect bodies were individually assayed by HPLC to establish their sugar profile as a measure of the level of energy reserves and the degree of food source use. 5. The average overall sugar content of P. xylostella and D. semiclausum collected in fields bordered by flowering margins was significantly higher than those of individuals collected from grass-bordered control plots. To the authors' knowledge, this represents the first demonstration that nectar-providing plants enhance the energetic state of herbivores under field conditions. 6. In contrast to earlier laboratory studies, the present study did not find elevated sugar contents in P. xylostella and D. semiclausum individuals collected from fields bordered by buckwheat (F. esculentum). 7. The present study shows widespread sugar feeding by both the herbivore and its parasitoid. It also shows that laboratory studies establishing nectar exploitation under controlled conditions can not always be extrapolated to actual exploitation under field conditions. This emphasises the importance of studying field-collected insects with regard to food source use and nutritional status.",34,2,221,227,Biological pest control; Nectar source; Nectar; Predation; Lobularia maritima; Honeydew; Pollen; Herbivore; Botany; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,http://core.ac.uk/display/29247117 http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/395369 https://pure.knaw.nl/portal/en/publications/nectar-providing-plants-enhance-the-energetic-state-of-herbivores https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2008.01059.x https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093087958,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2008.01059.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2311.2008.01059.x,2109695601,,0,006-484-508-970-158; 011-405-279-408-315; 011-784-213-196-607; 022-447-131-806-282; 024-328-534-323-358; 029-606-951-915-759; 032-225-968-310-157; 040-182-369-950-331; 040-477-314-227-099; 041-720-279-642-994; 042-195-189-711-603; 042-303-914-852-499; 044-405-697-969-681; 055-875-196-470-917; 056-892-630-404-500; 072-312-107-731-52X; 076-310-935-751-741; 076-349-963-255-639; 079-263-567-226-387; 082-857-610-495-598; 094-465-096-629-882; 096-139-400-901-30X; 097-789-429-598-931; 104-377-411-684-576; 123-328-213-000-581; 129-057-294-163-230; 138-410-158-813-551; 183-001-348-665-523; 194-595-863-937-394; 196-755-527-175-688,53

Aims To test if foraging Swallows select vegetated field boundaries in preference to field centres, if selection is influenced by weather conditions and local habitat type, and if patterns of selection are explained by differences in food availability between the two habitats. Methods Data were collected from paired vegetated field boundaries and field centres in lowland mixed farmland during good and bad weather conditions. The maximum number of foraging Swallows, total foraging time, food availability and local habitat type (adjacent crop type, presence/absence of boundary trees and boundary height) were recorded.

However, these wetlands are in a landscape dominated by agriculture and as a result, siltation and poor water quality are continual problems. We evaluated twelve wetland sites on federally managed Waterfowl Protection Areas from 2007 – 2009 for water quality, sediment quality, and macroinvertebrate diversity. Six of the sites received agricultural runoff directly via culverts and drainage ditches (non-buffered sites) and six sites were protected from agricultural runoff by a vegetated buffer (buffered sites). Mean total number of aquatic macroinvertebrates were significantly greater (p <0.001) for buffered sites (230 ± 44 standard error) than non-buffered sites (97 ± 24). Water from non-buffered sites had significantly greater turbidity, conductivity, and concentrations of chlorophyll α and atrazine than buffered sites in addition to consistently greater annual averages of total nitrogen and total phosphorus. Furthermore, sediments from non-buffered sites had significantly greater cadmium, potassium, sodium and zinc than buffered sites.

Thus, we used radiotelemetry to study movements of 32 black rat snakes at Remington Farms, Maryland, during 1988-89 to determine potential ways to minimize their depredations, Yearly home ranges were similar (P > 0.05) for males and females (x ± SE) (convex polygon, 9.49 ± 1.01 ha; 95% harmonic contour, 10.52 ± 1,24 ha), but males covered more (P < 0.05) of the home range earlier in the spring. Snakes were familiar with habitat features within their home range, returning to the same areas after prolonged absences. Snakes used forest edge, residential, hedgerow, and herbaceous/brush habitats more (P < 0.05-0.001) than expected by chance",57,4,812,826,Spatial ecology; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Home range; Geography; Elaphe; Black rat,,,,,https://eurekamag.com/research/009/439/009439091.php http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=3792474 http://www.jstor.org/stable/3809084?origin=crossref,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3809084,,10.2307/3809084,2317782042,,0,000-166-758-152-252; 024-357-037-686-564; 031-657-978-801-390; 044-296-185-424-362; 047-000-620-546-182; 052-939-444-032-424; 083-616-222-476-247; 112-457-382-099-297; 115-690-675-715-858; 116-000-375-873-139; 118-466-376-718-445; 122-623-243-519-582; 138-864-654-742-242; 167-923-799-318-88X; 175-314-472-871-540; 185-828-854-562-824; 192-171-445-302-263,125

Kuske; Franco Widmer; Peter J. Edwards; Ted C. J. Turlings; Dirk Babendreier; Franz Bigler,"Abstract Field studies were carried out to evaluate whether inundative releases of Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) against the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), can have negative effects on the indigenous arthropod fauna in adjacent non-target habitats. Emigration of released T. brassicae from maize fields into non-target habitats was monitored, and its persistence in non-target habitats was assessed throughout the season. For this purpose, sticky traps were installed on metal sticks along transects from the inside of T. brassicae treated maize fields into sown wildflower strips and a natural common reed stand. In addition, cards with host eggs were used to monitor Trichogramma within potential overwintering sites. Although the highest numbers of released parasitoids were trapped within maize, a considerable amount of T. brassicae moved into non-target habitats. We found a significant transient increase of T. brassicae in both wildflower strips and reeds and no consistent decrease in numbers of trapped wasps up to 40 m from the maize field borders, when monitored directly following mass releases. Indigenous Trichogramma species were present both in the wildflower strip and reeds, and T. brassicae represented only a minor part of the overall Trichogramma population therein, except for a few days after release. However, a few T. brassicae persisted in non-target habitats throughout the season and were still present prior to releases in the subsequent year. These low numbers are not expected to seriously affect populations of native Trichogramma or non-target host species.",27,2,181,193,Trichogramma evanescens; Wildflower; Trichogramma; Trichogramma brassicae; Trichogrammatidae; Crambidae; European corn borer; Population; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049964402001913 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1049964402001913,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1049-9644(02)00191-3,,10.1016/s1049-9644(02)00191-3,1971700195,,0,005-842-466-777-245; 007-963-626-431-416; 021-182-418-408-110; 022-781-325-815-607; 023-798-521-242-444; 025-367-343-448-885; 030-103-925-286-515; 034-972-407-294-216; 038-162-245-228-179; 040-139-143-139-593; 042-958-235-295-202; 044-492-635-032-154; 045-340-973-523-646; 046-090-986-124-764; 048-603-450-859-002; 049-630-489-574-485; 051-812-317-276-923; 056-259-436-600-90X; 061-996-703-449-644; 067-738-830-062-377; 069-622-688-188-080; 073-041-202-359-767; 078-686-575-684-423; 081-246-970-346-933; 086-400-240-768-32X; 093-316-442-256-607; 100-991-922-429-803; 103-547-760-004-228; 123-377-863-393-090; 135-472-656-571-49X; 137-629-680-311-730; 145-850-386-716-385; 158-809-050-632-935; 160-718-963-333-276; 162-656-155-071-409; 169-006-894-689-229; 180-972-224-853-453; 192-081-073-430-002,49

Osborne; Andrew F. G. Bourke; Stephen N. Freeman; Richard F. Pywell; Matthew S. Heard,"The global decline of insect pollinators, especially bees, is cause for concern, and there is an urgent need for cost-effective conservation measures in agricultural landscapes. While landscape context and habitat quality are known to influence species richness and abundance of bees, there is a lack of evidence from manipulative field experiments on bees' responses to adaptive management across differently structured landscapes. We present the results of a large-scale study that investigated the effects of a targeted agri-environment scheme (AES) on bumble bees (Bombus spp.) over three years in the United Kingdom. Forage patches of different sizes were sown with a conservation flower mixture across eight sites covering a broad range of agricultural land use types. Species richness and worker densities (especially of the longer-tongued Bombus species for which the mixture was targeted) were significantly higher on sown forage patches than on existing non-crop control habitats throughout the three-year study, but the strength of this response depended on both the proportions of arable land and abundance of herbaceous forb species in the surrounding landscape. The size of sown patches also affected worker density, with smaller patches (0.25 ha) attracting higher densities of some species than larger patches (1.0 ha). Our models show that a targeted AES can deliver greater net benefits in more intensively farmed areas, in terms of the number and species richness of bumble bees supported, than in heterogeneous landscapes where other foraging habitats exist. These findings serve to strengthen the evidence base for extending agri-environment schemes to boost declining pollinator populations to a larger number of agricultural landscapes across the globe.",21,5,1760,1771,Pollinator; Forage (honey bee); Forb; Foraging; Habitat; Ecology; Context (language use); Species richness; Agroforestry; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,"Agriculture; Animals; Bees/classification; Behavior, Animal/physiology; Conservation of Natural Resources/methods; Ecosystem; England; Flowers",,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBS/E/C/00004970) United Kingdom,https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/10-0677.1 https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/34532 https://core.ac.uk/display/2779919 https://repository.rothamsted.ac.uk/item/8q936/bumble-bee-species-responses-to-a-targeted-conservation-measure-depend-on-landscape-context-and-habitat-quality http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/10-0677.1/abstract https://www.jstor.org/stable/23023115 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/10-0677.1 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21830716 https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/34532/1/Carvell_etal_2011_EcolAppl.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/2779919.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/10-0677.1,21830716,10.1890/10-0677.1,2138326488,,0,003-460-280-575-85X; 008-225-619-668-580; 010-290-657-368-370; 011-968-803-898-621; 012-267-243-122-028; 013-185-681-358-943; 014-590-282-698-428; 015-905-951-111-509; 016-989-884-391-279; 018-631-611-493-436; 020-453-657-118-968; 021-657-818-388-442; 021-763-881-730-115; 022-392-117-877-556; 023-208-215-719-846; 024-093-678-975-458; 024-940-486-253-797; 028-043-899-910-64X; 031-862-039-493-29X; 034-333-107-858-752; 034-980-495-883-757; 035-138-891-064-544; 037-733-558-467-103; 046-004-550-166-441; 048-543-721-099-075; 049-091-169-377-597; 050-170-086-535-191; 052-425-505-697-799; 052-621-223-170-401; 056-099-523-856-735; 069-083-458-833-742; 074-793-529-288-006; 075-065-572-952-073; 078-419-232-375-219; 083-810-224-480-214; 085-507-496-811-84X; 098-312-271-690-700; 104-896-273-096-868; 111-381-468-642-188; 112-917-317-852-89X; 115-606-139-771-296; 117-947-244-584-95X; 120-524-273-028-868; 150-275-342-089-773; 161-644-427-039-572; 168-312-770-361-773; 178-850-274-409-230,108

Eyre; Dorota Labanowska-Bury; Roger White; Carlo Leifert,"Beneficial invertebrate numbers in two organic leek fields in eastern England were assessed in relation to four field margin vegetation treatments (clover/grass, regeneration, two flower mixtures) using pitfall and pan traps. Damage caused by onion thrips in one field was also estimated. Clover/grass and regeneration margins generally had more beneficial invertebrates than either flower mixture margins and invertebrate numbers in the fields were least opposite flower mixture margins. Distance from field margins had a greater effect on invertebrate numbers, with most ladybirds (Coccinellidae), hoverflies (Syrphidae), lacewings (Neuroptera) and parasitic wasps (Hymenoptera) recorded from the middle of fields. High ladybird, hoverfly and parasitic wasp (Icheumonidae) numbers were associated with lowest onion thrip damage, but there was no evidence that field margin treatments were related to damage. Sown flower mixture margins did not positively affect beneficial invertebrate numbers in the leek crop. It appears that an approach in keeping with elements already in the landscape would be just as effective as the use of alien vegetation mixtures in generating invertebrate natural enemy activity in vegetable fields of eastern England.",1,1,45,54,Biological pest control; Invertebrate; Crop; Vegetation; Hoverfly; Neuroptera; Hymenoptera; Coccinellidae; Botany; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs13165-010-0004-x.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13165-010-0004-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13165-010-0004-x,,10.1007/s13165-010-0004-x,2053361246,,0,000-751-403-315-726; 002-669-586-055-41X; 021-727-244-747-274; 023-935-502-746-047; 032-890-211-021-409; 033-049-147-231-044; 035-409-446-388-665; 045-445-063-674-649; 046-580-717-487-315; 049-076-525-923-166; 056-585-869-238-25X; 056-789-845-462-569; 056-892-630-404-500; 064-893-774-544-494; 064-975-099-130-640; 065-346-869-208-139; 081-596-943-724-716; 091-265-753-392-171; 100-231-568-193-495; 101-983-135-825-205; 117-345-687-903-78X; 117-361-487-287-804; 122-701-551-435-613; 130-565-978-349-235; 143-018-143-941-491; 153-195-377-079-785; 158-622-915-499-732; 176-100-710-487-88X,4

The CERES-Maize and CROPGRO-Soybean, two of the main crop growth models incorporated into the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), were developed to simulate the effects of environmental conditions, different management strategies, and genetics on crop growth and development. These models currently do not have an option for calculating erosion and phosphorus (P) dynamics. In this study, the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) and sediment-bound P model were incorporated into CERES-Maize and CROPGRO-Soybean models. The evapotranspiration component of the CERES-Maize model was also evaluated to test the ability of the model to simulate the effects of shelterbelts on com transpiration. Two years of sap flow data collected from corn plants in a sheltered (3H) and unsheltered (25H) areas in a field near Ogden, Iowa, were used for model testing. Results showed that the CERES-Maize model simulated daily plant transpiration well in both sheltered and unsheltered areas with RMSE of 0.53 mm d""1 (3H) and 0.75 mm (25H) in 2001, and 0.85 mm d""1 (3H) and 0.59 mm d""1 (25H) in 2002. Average coefficient of determination (r2) for 2001 and 2002 was 0.90 and 0.73, respectively, indicating good correlation between simulated and observed transpiration. After erosion and sediment-bound P subroutines were incorporated into CERES-Maize and CROPGRO-Soybean, the models were calibrated and tested using five years of data collected from two field sites in a watershed in Tama County, Iowa. Results showed that generally both models tended to over or underpredict daily sediment and sediment bound P losses from",,,,,Simulation modeling; Erosion; Coefficient of determination; Watershed; Transpiration; Soil science; Evapotranspiration; DSSAT; Universal Soil Loss Equation; Environmental science,,,,,https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1772&context=rtd https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/rtd/773/,http://dx.doi.org/10.31274/rtd-180813-11436,,10.31274/rtd-180813-11436,636231478,,0,001-291-938-800-068; 001-652-696-371-918; 005-057-680-860-88X; 005-643-804-935-129; 006-795-240-223-976; 013-639-110-556-018; 022-937-199-811-282; 023-562-983-275-776; 027-794-497-211-644; 028-428-265-295-590; 029-121-788-921-650; 034-917-244-372-977; 038-920-265-240-933; 040-784-855-109-386; 045-286-294-795-215; 046-879-541-607-948; 052-581-627-565-545; 053-200-987-091-392; 055-488-793-301-441; 056-896-290-986-126; 060-306-751-394-513; 064-195-162-313-451; 066-593-397-530-561; 066-947-210-171-825; 070-746-925-504-279; 071-963-427-973-352; 078-331-301-734-283; 093-423-483-353-722; 097-460-493-803-721; 106-827-778-795-879; 110-120-694-716-93X; 110-257-671-052-859; 111-235-215-888-598; 113-774-066-225-306; 120-166-770-024-692; 122-758-469-964-011; 140-016-610-781-311; 169-155-720-588-232; 172-329-563-782-554; 173-581-303-355-346; 177-834-571-788-699; 179-859-178-524-375,0

Sown wildflower strips proved to support much higher abundances and species numbers of butterflies and bumblebees than greenways, with 86% of all butterflies and 83% of all bumblebees being observed in the sown flower strips. However, in both types of green structure mostly common species were found. Counts of flower visits showed that Knautia, Centaurea and Cirsium were the most commonly visited plant species. The greenways studied did not seem to fulfil their function of enhancing biodiversity—at least not for butterflies and bumblebees.

This pattern is also a component of farm management and development. This paper deals with modeling the land use spatial organization in farms according to these dual criteria. The hypothesis is tested that the location of farms along a gradient of bocage landscape—gradient of decreasing hedgerows density and increasing field size—influences their inner land use organization. The tests were based on mutual information and provided a hierarchy of driving factors of land use allocation in farms, as well as a classification of combinations of land use and field types. Three bocage sites—A, dense; B, intermediate; and C, open bocage—were chosen in northeast Brittany (France), on a 20 km2 micro-region of conventional dairy production based on maize (Zea mays L.), grassland and winter cereals, mainly wheat (Triticum spp.). In this context, land use allocation in a farm was better explained by the characteristics of the farm territory, i.e. the actual land used by a single farm, rather than by the characteristics of the farm household/enterprise, as defined by production, socioeconomic and technical features. Farms of the open bocage showed marked concentric patterns of land use away from the farmsteads, involving progressively pastures used by dairy cows, fodder crops, pastures used by livestock and cash crops. In these farms, there was a pronounced differentiation of the fields that held simultaneously constraints of surrounding hedgerows, small size and hydromorphy. Farms of the dense bocage site were more fragmented and constraints were distributed more diversely through fields, so that land use allocation was not optimized according to the distance from the farmstead. The concentric pattern of land use was therefore distorted in these farms. At a landscape level, such distortions led to a land use mosaic dominated by large patches of specialized fields in the open bocage, and to a fine grain and heterogeneous land use mosaic in the dense bocage. This study therefore demonstrated how the structure of the farm territory in different bocage landscapes has a major influence on land use allocation in farms. The results emphasize the interaction between land use and land structuring in farm quality of management, which in turn influences the landscape structure.",101,1,53,72,Livestock; Agriculture; Cash crop; Common spatial pattern; Geography; Grassland; Context (language use); Driving factors; Land use; Agroforestry,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880903001993 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880903001993,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-8809(03)00199-3,,10.1016/s0167-8809(03)00199-3,2041181481,,0,000-484-826-607-866; 000-689-156-232-020; 002-607-184-736-112; 003-546-476-189-819; 005-984-268-611-870; 009-519-509-199-293; 010-687-152-524-484; 011-763-120-498-742; 023-950-701-194-236; 026-537-035-659-141; 030-957-113-466-229; 035-527-491-535-676; 037-957-821-245-261; 039-800-551-937-475; 040-398-047-933-072; 041-788-996-695-512; 047-169-122-814-90X; 051-434-907-184-089; 053-137-818-248-134; 067-358-106-573-016; 068-110-607-470-581; 073-021-255-359-439; 073-394-076-706-054; 073-991-527-323-833; 074-988-388-452-369; 081-015-842-500-088; 084-776-462-976-223; 089-257-427-127-83X; 089-585-128-318-217; 091-362-025-881-051; 091-758-692-195-881; 092-983-060-262-609; 093-661-771-475-269; 101-931-589-244-355; 106-864-238-578-702; 108-532-360-722-802; 113-221-284-601-672; 115-818-187-214-915; 130-698-554-759-854; 130-822-660-683-860; 133-716-442-972-509; 134-910-223-418-626; 144-311-251-829-72X; 157-792-538-740-695; 176-506-367-701-104; 198-944-659-141-32X,83

Lalonde; H. R. Whiteley; N. K. Kaushik,"The impact of vegetated filter strips (VFS) on sediment removal from runoff has been studied extensively in recent years. Vegetation is believed to increase water infiltration and decrease water turbulence thus enhancing sediment deposition within filter media. In the study reported here, field experiments have been conducted to examine the efficiency of vegetated filter strips for sediment removal from cropland runoff. Twenty filters with varying length, slope and vegetated cover were used under simulated runoff conditions with an average sediment concentration of 2700 mg/L. The filters were 2, 5, 10 and 15 m long with a slope of 2·3 and 5% and three types of vegetation. Three other strips with bare soil were used as a control. The experimental results showed that the average sediment trapping efficiency of all filters was 84% and ranging from 68% in a 2-m filter to as high as 98% in a 15-m long filter compared with only 25% for the control. The length of filter has been found to be the predominant factor affecting sediment deposition in VFS up to 10 m. Increasing filter length to 15 m did not improve sediment trapping efficiency under the present experimental conditions. The rate of incoming flow and vegetation cover percentage has a secondary effect on sediment deposition in VFS.

Habitat destruction and increasing land use intensity result in habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, and subsequently in the loss of species diversity. The fact that these factors are often highly confounded makes disentangling their effects extremely difficult, if not impossible, and their relative impact on species loss is mostly speculative. 2. In a two-year study, we analysed the relative importance of changed landscape composition (increased areas of cropped habitats), reduced habitat connectivity and reduced habitat quality on nest colonization of cavity-nesting bees, wasps and their parasitoids. We selected 23 pairs of conventional and organic wheat fields in the centre of landscape circles (500 m radius) differing in edge densities (landscape configuration) and % non-crop habitats (landscape composition). Standardized trap nests were established in the field centres and in neighbouring permanent fallow strips (making a total of 92 nesting sites). 3. Factors at all three scales affected nest colonization. While bees were enhanced by high proportions of non-crop habitat in the landscape, wasps profited from high edge densities, supporting our hypothesis that wasps are enhanced by connecting corridors. Colonization of herbivore-predating wasps was lower in field centres than in fallow strips for conventional sites, but not for organic sites, indicating a fallow-like connectivity value of organic fields. The relative importance of habitat type and farming system varied among functional groups suggesting that their perception of crop-non-crop boundaries or the availability of their food resources differed. 4. Local and landscape effects on parasitoids were mainly mediated by their hosts. Parasitism rates were marginally affected by local factors. A specialist parasitoid was more sensitive to high land use intensity than its host, whereas generalist parasitoids were less sensitive. 5. We conclude that the conversion of cropland into non-crop habitat may not be a sufficiently successful strategy to enhance wasps or other species that suffer more from isolation than from habitat loss. Interestingly, habitat connectivity appeared to be enhanced by both higher edge densities and by organic field management. Thus, we conclude that high proportions of conventionally managed and large crop fields threaten pollination and biological control services at a landscape scale.",79,2,491,500,Pollinator; Biodiversity; Pollination; Nest; Habitat; Ecology; Parasitoid; Generalist and specialist species; Habitat destruction; Biology,,Agriculture; Animals; Bees/parasitology; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Wasps/parasitology,,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01642.x https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20015213/ https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103077582 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20015213 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01642.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01642.x/full https://eref.uni-bayreuth.de/id/eprint/16289 https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01642.x https://europepmc.org/article/MED/20015213,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01642.x,20015213,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01642.x,2019296384,,0,001-051-404-142-811; 004-916-984-876-81X; 007-590-189-380-964; 008-225-619-668-580; 008-291-203-169-732; 015-311-657-471-492; 015-348-182-108-487; 017-516-181-294-137; 018-209-687-890-039; 023-935-502-746-047; 024-240-876-657-562; 026-735-761-517-671; 027-867-910-497-397; 030-989-751-486-255; 031-189-865-030-804; 031-862-039-493-29X; 032-452-486-736-649; 035-775-229-294-961; 043-334-181-578-717; 044-315-002-495-725; 045-445-063-674-649; 050-137-130-449-043; 054-274-474-416-858; 056-064-713-708-207; 056-789-845-462-569; 056-892-630-404-500; 057-420-111-160-322; 057-720-330-037-206; 060-093-061-735-556; 062-218-780-389-812; 062-501-527-775-318; 072-547-204-496-863; 075-666-685-673-883; 083-674-424-765-819; 086-268-358-012-610; 086-525-130-009-786; 089-762-789-750-124; 093-579-516-936-299; 094-542-264-880-862; 098-312-271-690-700; 113-194-919-014-308; 115-606-139-771-296; 117-345-687-903-78X; 119-131-541-250-789; 136-469-390-650-498; 142-024-470-292-163; 145-176-906-866-327; 146-382-118-408-345; 153-465-066-221-921; 154-386-144-197-99X; 176-438-790-085-693; 185-374-982-166-638,210

Peach; Lucy J Lovett; Simon R. Wotton; C Jeffs,"Enhancement of farmland biodiversity is a key objective of agri-environment schemes in Europe, and conservation of the rare and threatened cirl bunting (Emberiza cirlus) has been a key objective for the Countryside Stewardship Scheme (CSS) in south Devon, UK. Cirl bunting numbers increased by 83% on land entering CSS management agreements between 1992 and 1998, compared with an increase of just 2% on adjacent countryside not managed under CSS. The increase in cirl buntings on stewardship land was part of a wider regional increase in abundance rather than a redistribution of birds away from land not under stewardship. In 1998, 22% of all UK cirl buntings were breeding on land under CSS agreements and a further 16% of birds were within 0.5 km of land under stewardship. All but one of the 27 agreements that gained cirl buntings were within 2 km of cirl bunting breeding sites in 1992, with more distant agreements failing to be colonised even if they offered a range of potentially beneficial prescriptions. Agreements providing grass margins around arable fields, weedy winter stubbles and open patches of grassland next to scrub tended to gain additional cirl buntings. Grass margins and weedy winter stubbles constitute important food-rich habitats for cirl buntings and other farmland birds, and should be encouraged in future agri-environment agreements and schemes.",101,3,361,373,Wildlife conservation; Geography; Threatened species; Emberizidae; Corn bunting; Stewardship; Bunting; Emberiza cirlus; Environmental protection; Agroforestry; Arable land,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320701000830,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0006-3207(01)00083-0,,10.1016/s0006-3207(01)00083-0,2046244366,,0,002-703-421-233-974; 005-748-037-104-033; 020-167-621-399-502; 029-705-760-353-953; 030-831-977-852-027; 040-901-078-709-677; 054-572-651-357-154; 061-720-549-016-471; 069-782-734-542-902; 071-363-274-178-219; 073-371-511-259-999; 076-674-880-559-556; 079-168-551-130-991; 080-139-567-968-521; 084-605-487-121-903; 091-194-163-731-182; 094-746-201-098-704; 114-480-653-531-829; 122-021-342-537-614; 145-653-851-729-665; 187-590-829-629-05X,229

Dunn; G. Julien; William Ernst; A. Cook; K.G. Doe; P.M. Jackman,"To minimize the risk posed by runoff from row crops, Prince Edward Island introduced buffer legislation in 2000. The legislation mandates 10-m and 20-m buffers, respectively, for moderate sloped (i.e. 5%) agricultural fields that border streams. Since 2001, Environment Canada has been evaluating the effectiveness of various buffer widths on operational farms in reducing toxicity and contaminant concentrations in runoff. Sample collectors, placed in 44 fields at the field edge (0m), 10m and at distances out to 30m, collected overland flow following rainfall-induced runoff events. Samples were collected within 24 hours of an event and analysed for seven pesticides (endosulfan, chlorothalonil, carbofuran, linuron, metribuzin, metalaxyl, mancozeb), water quality parameters and Daphnia magna toxicity. The 10-m buffer required for moderate sloped fields was effective at reducing contaminant concentrations but not always to less than lethal concentrations to Daphnia magna. Limited data beyond 10m for fields of both slope types precluded making recommendations on a suitable buffer width for shallow sloped fields and evaluating the effectiveness of 20-m buffers for steep sloped fields. When paired data were combined and statistically tested for all fields, the studied pesticides underwent a 52-98% and 68-100% reduction in aqueous and particulate concentrations within 10m and 30m, respectively. In addition, by 10m, soluble phosphorus, nitrate-nitrogen and total suspended solids were reduced by 34%, 38% and 64%, respectively. Results suggest buffer zones on operational farms are capable of achieving contaminant reductions comparable to those reported for controlled experiments. Inconsistent siting of sample collectors beyond 10m limited the evaluation of the effects of field slope and buffer width on buffer effectiveness on working farms. Future studies on buffer efficiency on operational farms should focus on building the data set beyond 10m and evaluating load reductions.",409,5,868,882,Pesticide; Chlorothalonil; Buffer zone; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science; STREAMS; Total suspended solids; Surface runoff; Environmental monitoring; Environmental engineering,,"Agriculture/legislation & jurisprudence; Animals; Daphnia/drug effects; Environmental Monitoring; Pesticides/analysis; Prince Edward Island; Rain; Rivers/chemistry; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis; Water Pollution/legislation & jurisprudence","Pesticides; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21163513/ http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969710012428 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969710012428 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21163513 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ScTEn.409..868D/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.11.011,21163513,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.11.011,1988199854,,0,002-650-706-842-54X; 005-046-617-641-306; 009-742-460-635-737; 013-452-798-688-19X; 015-274-013-722-997; 020-537-450-372-975; 024-618-280-817-643; 024-998-467-249-663; 025-131-472-929-81X; 029-496-825-325-876; 040-806-887-128-56X; 042-036-288-239-561; 042-230-387-909-769; 044-401-317-828-273; 046-747-744-517-198; 052-894-240-545-387; 064-662-281-730-944; 066-508-752-240-077; 070-129-859-863-682; 076-826-572-086-275; 078-927-735-353-813; 079-562-504-772-874; 082-797-391-654-568; 083-528-691-484-522; 102-929-358-865-836; 103-148-967-328-600; 103-286-115-762-912; 111-288-588-656-115; 117-074-543-175-080; 169-607-559-923-667; 181-090-792-931-175; 191-147-319-900-194; 194-158-767-830-671,56

Pywell; E. A. Warman; Tim H. Sparks; J.N. Greatorex-Davies; Kevin J. Walker; W. R. Meek; Claire Carvell; Sandrine Petit; Les G. Firbank,"The conservation and management of biodiversity requires accurate, repeatable and cost-effective monitoring techniques. In this study, a simple and rapid methodology was employed to measure the quality of different habitats for butterfly species on 10 arable farms in lowland Britain. This habitat monitoring was seven times more rapid than the traditional species-based butterfly monitoring. Data on butterfly abundance were combined with the information gathered on habitat quality at five of the farms using stepwise regression. These models had a consistently high degree of explanatory power for the summary variables of total butterfly abundance and species richness, and the functional groupings of mobile and immobile species. There was good agreement between observed and predicted estimates of species richness and abundance when the models were validated on a further five independent sites. Models to predict the abundance of 11 common butterfly species were also produced. These varied considerably in their predictive power and validity between species. The results clearly demonstrated the beneficial effects of targeted habitat creation for butterflies which is promoted under the Agri-environment Schemes, especially the recently introduced pollen and nectar seed mixtures (WM2) available under the Countryside Stewardship Scheme. The models confirmed the importance of shelter, floristically diverse field margins and the availability of nectar resources from legume species in explaining the abundance of immobile butterfly species in arable landscapes. These sources of nectar and the presence of larval host plants in the crucifer family were important factors in explaining the abundance of mobile species. The results are discussed in terms of the potential of this approach for: (i) assessing habitat quality for butterflies in intensively managed landscapes; (ii) enhancing the value of butterfly monitoring schemes in explaining changes in butterfly abundance at the site and national scale; and (iii) informing habitat management and restoration guidelines for butterfly conservation on arable farmland.",118,3,313,325,Biodiversity; Nectar; Habitat; Ecology; Butterfly; Species richness; Agroecosystem; Arable land; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320703003690 https://core.ac.uk/display/381230,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2003.09.011,,10.1016/j.biocon.2003.09.011,2090811884,,0,008-167-536-662-383; 009-012-164-159-153; 010-388-027-175-334; 015-031-975-300-430; 022-821-709-291-930; 032-493-338-723-126; 033-171-578-206-480; 033-248-413-039-314; 040-213-683-952-22X; 044-445-829-636-966; 047-547-531-740-994; 048-443-302-315-740; 051-060-286-692-596; 056-383-727-358-744; 056-585-869-238-25X; 063-024-434-156-048; 071-000-612-789-205; 073-010-346-426-592; 077-623-747-437-53X; 079-068-774-342-74X; 080-164-660-083-693; 082-389-624-773-160; 086-062-368-206-503; 096-611-124-444-400; 105-145-742-902-746; 107-150-898-526-934; 114-480-653-531-829; 117-233-951-265-769; 146-186-564-390-79X; 170-590-252-813-233; 171-352-683-438-394; 171-738-087-214-88X; 180-254-269-257-202; 185-008-568-344-443,125

Two types were attached to forest: remnant hedgerows (n = 14), and regenerated hedgerows (n = 11) that had grown up spontaneously between open fields in the last 50 years. There were no significant differences between remnant and regenerated hedgerows in the richness or abundance of forest herbs, presumably indicating colonization of regenerated hedgerows. Such colonization implies that hedgerows serve a corridor function.; ; ; ; 3 The species composition of forest herbs in hedgerows attached to forest stands showed a strong affinity with that of the adjacent stand, both for remnant and regenerated hedgerows.; ; ; ; 4 There was a distance effect within hedgerows. Richness of forest herbs and similarity of composition to forest declined with distance along the hedgerow from forest, implying colonization from the adjacent attached stand.; ; ; ; 5 The third type of hedgerow sampled, isolated remnants (n = 7), was not lower in richness or abundance of forest herbs than hedgerows attached to forest.",87,2,220,232,Ecology; Geography; Forest restoration; Wildlife corridor; Colonization; Herb; Biological dispersal; Species richness; Abundance (ecology); Landscape ecology; Forestry,,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2745.1999.00339.x/full http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2745.1999.00339.x/abstract https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2745.1999.00339.x https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND22012417,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.1999.00339.x,,10.1046/j.1365-2745.1999.00339.x,2022575531,,0,007-361-282-044-640; 010-606-209-586-997; 012-338-039-886-640; 017-631-065-394-548; 018-300-493-662-705; 022-609-146-511-814; 023-550-478-021-179; 023-808-269-967-123; 024-608-779-166-000; 027-083-955-830-725; 027-625-507-174-190; 028-361-466-335-583; 031-373-858-392-073; 036-767-596-551-436; 048-131-899-204-45X; 060-908-261-724-928; 063-207-503-700-767; 068-044-639-203-805; 068-061-324-831-836; 069-222-611-667-46X; 080-357-443-253-546; 082-856-470-932-156; 083-665-162-525-30X; 091-812-760-612-259; 110-115-299-576-037; 121-317-824-662-174; 122-100-193-451-993; 125-914-670-875-636; 142-178-368-818-650; 154-978-657-665-321; 155-555-776-794-70X; 165-123-901-414-731; 180-498-851-796-990; 187-050-769-304-212,118

Bahlai; S. Sikkema; Rebecca H. Hallett; Jonathan A. Newman; Arthur W. Schaafsma,"Soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura) is a severe pest of soybean in central North America. Outbreaks of the aphid in Ontario are often spotty in distribution, with some geographical areas affected severely and others with few or no aphid populations occurring in soybean for the duration of the season. A. glycines spend summers on soybean and overwinter on buckthorn, a shrub that is widespread in southern Ontario and is commonly found in agricultural hedgerows and at the margins of woodlots. A. glycines likely use both short distance migratory flights from buckthorn and longer distance dispersal flights in the search for acceptable summer hosts. This study aims to model colonization of soybean fields by A. glycines engaged in early-season migration from overwintering hosts. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was used to rank numerous competing linear and probit models using field parameters to predict aphid presence, colonization, and density. The variable that best modeled aphid density in soybean fields in the early season was the ratio of buckthorn density to field area, although dramatic differences in relationships between the parameters were observed between study years. This study has important applications in predicting areas that are at elevated risk of developing economically damaging populations of soybean aphid and which may act as sources for further infestation.",39,1,50,56,Ecology; Population density; Overwintering; Aphid; Rhamnus cathartica; Aphididae; Soybean aphid; Rhamnus; Biological dispersal; Biology,,"Animals; Aphids/physiology; Environment; Host-Parasite Interactions; Models, Biological; Ontario; Population Density; Rhamnus/parasitology; Soybeans/parasitology",,,https://bioone.org/journals/environmental-entomology/volume-39/issue-1/EN09127/Modeling-Distribution-and-Abundance-of-Soybean-Aphid-in-Soybean-Fields/10.1603/EN09127.full https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20146839/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20146839 https://bioone.org/journals/Environmental-Entomology/volume-39/issue-1/EN09127/Modeling-Distribution-and-Abundance-of-Soybean-Aphid-in-Soybean-Fields/10.1603/EN09127.pdf https://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1603/EN09127 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103080246 https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/39/1/50/592457 https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/2170,http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/en09127,20146839,10.1603/en09127,2104711199,,0,005-153-286-040-162; 005-642-107-695-233; 008-214-400-825-744; 017-077-901-147-396; 019-649-267-718-81X; 030-349-538-872-178; 032-374-716-268-377; 033-182-817-645-741; 039-745-007-858-002; 044-080-144-882-057; 048-851-392-910-393; 056-892-630-404-500; 057-345-086-176-711; 062-851-124-614-085; 065-845-292-318-056; 068-488-683-997-304; 075-907-279-724-053; 085-354-024-800-232; 087-520-578-895-249; 091-987-030-133-410; 093-861-925-204-733; 101-211-203-571-64X; 107-736-952-100-183; 109-250-131-863-872; 111-165-420-592-867; 130-181-904-616-852; 131-876-035-982-97X; 132-468-693-045-48X; 136-595-871-667-765; 138-135-814-218-694; 145-568-442-157-575; 162-843-150-220-755,42

The Neotropical Region has experienced large habitat transformations as a result of intensified agriculture. These changes have affected the populations of many species of birds in the Espinal ecoregion of Argentina. However, relationships between birds and agriculture in the neotropics are poorly known. We assessed the effects of crops and field margins in an area of agriculture typical for the Espinal ecoregion on the structure of the bird community, and we assessed the value of this habitat for species of conservation concern. Birds and vegetation were sampled in and along the margins of fields of soybean (the most widespread crop) and alfalfa. Twenty-five of the 41 species recorded—including all the species of conservation concern—were found almost exclusively in field margins; only five species occurred almost exclusively in within the fields. All other species were found in both margins and fields. Density, richness, and diversity were much greater on the margins than in the fields.

052-121-834-684-873,NARROW GRASS HEDGE EFFECTS ON NUTRIENT TRANSPORT FOLLOWING SWINE SLURRY APPLICATION,,2013,conference proceedings article,"2013 Kansas City, Missouri, July 21 - July 24, 2013",,American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers,,John E. Gilley; Shannon L. Bartelt-Hunt; Seth J. Lamb; Xu Li; David B. Marx; Daniel D. Snow; David B. Parker; Brian L. Woodbury,"The effectiveness of a narrow grass hedge in reducing runoff nutrient loads following swine slurry application was examined. Slurry was applied to 0.75 m wide by 4.0 m long plots established on an Aksarben silty clay loam soil located in southeast Nebraska. Manure treatments consisted of no manure application and manure application to meet the 1, 2, or 3 year nitrogen (N) requirements for corn. Runoff water quality was measured during three 30 min simulated rainfall events. The grass hedge did not significantly reduce runoff nutrient transport after the swine slurry, which contained relatively small amounts of manure, was applied. Increasing the N application rate from a 1 year to a 3 year corn N requirement also did not result in a significant increase in N or phosphorus (P) loads in runoff. The grass hedge significantly reduced electrical conductivity (EC) measurements from 0.78 to 0.73 dS m -1 and pH values from 8.16 to 7.85.

Klein; Gerhard W. Brümmer,"The efficiency of filter strips in protecting watercourses against herbicides in run-off was evaluated in field experiments in western Germany. Surface run-off caused by natural rainfall and related transport of metolachlor, terbuthylazine and pendimethalin were measured on plots of 40 m length without filter strips (F0), and after passing over three types of herbicide-untreated field margin: 12 m conservation headland (CH12), 6 m (GF6) and 12 m grass strips (GF12). Run-off was also measured after simulated rainfall on 7 m long plots without (F0) and with 3 m grass strips (GF3). All three herbicides were transported both in dissolved and in adsorbed forms; the partitioning depended on their water solubility with metolachlor and terbuthylazine mainly translocated in dissolved form (F0: highest mean concentrations for a natural run-off event 721 and 220 μg L -1 , respectively). Pendimethalin was predominantly transported in adsorbed form (maximum mean concentration 11.2 μg L -1 ). In the sediment, the highest mean herbicide contents in a single natural event (F0) accounted for 2294 μg kg -1 (metolachlor), 1317 μg kg -1 (terbuthylazine) and 5648 μg kg -1 (pendimethalin). The proportions of applied herbicide translocated were 0.3% (metolachlor), 0.2% (terbuthylazine) and 0.06% (pendimethalin; F0, natural rainfall). The extent of herbicide transport decreased with time but within this trend soil sealing, soil moisture and amount and intensity of rainfall increased losses. Compared with the F0 plots, the reduction of herbicide translocation after natural rainfall reached 80-83% (CH12), 80-88% (GF6) and >99% (GF12) over the 3-year period. The 12 m grass strips allowed only one extreme run-off event to pass through, thus providing a highly effective watercourse protection against herbicide pollution.",23,3,294,305,Pesticide; Water content; Terbuthylazine; Pendimethalin; Metolachlor; Sediment; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Agronomy; Surface water,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1475-2743.2007.00097.x https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-2743.2007.00097.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-2743.2007.00097.x,,10.1111/j.1475-2743.2007.00097.x,2088845239,,0,000-526-408-411-556; 001-424-754-077-983; 003-148-094-786-550; 003-888-081-454-171; 006-232-969-732-127; 027-521-568-087-326; 049-773-598-549-535; 051-851-638-777-86X; 069-097-776-076-932; 094-049-137-663-313; 096-878-710-039-072; 102-299-231-485-20X; 111-288-588-656-115; 117-074-543-175-080; 131-944-587-954-848; 149-367-063-545-839; 176-181-840-447-605; 181-000-667-326-695,48

Fossey; Y. Fauvel; Philippe Merot,"Chloride is a major anion in soil water and its concentration rises essentially as a function of evapotranspiration. Compared to herbaceous vegetation, high transpiration rates are measured for isolated trees, shelterbelts or hedgerows. This article deals with the influence of a tree hedge on the soil and groundwater Cl− concentrations and the possibility of using Cl− as an indicator of transpiration and water movements near the tree rows. Cl− concentrations were measured over 1 year at different depths in the unsaturated zone and in the groundwater along a transect intersecting a bottomland oak hedge. We observed a strong spatial heterogeneity of Cl− concentrations, with very high values up to 2 g l−1 in the unsaturated zone and 1·2 g l−1 in the upper part of the groundwater. This contrasts with the low and homogeneous concentrations (60–70 mg l−1) in the deeper part of the groundwater. Cl− accumulation in the unsaturated zone at the end of the vegetation season allows us to identify the active root zone extension of trees. In winter, upslope of the tree row, downwards leaching partly renews the soil solution in the root zone, while the slow water movement under the trees or farther downslope results in Cl− accumulation and leads to a salinization of the soil and groundwater. This salinization is of the same order as experimental conditions produce negative effects on oak seedlings. The measurement of Cl− concentrations in the unsaturated zone under tree rows at the end of the vegetation season would indicate whether certain topographic, pedological or climatic conditions are likely to favour a strong salinization of the soil, as observed in the present study.

Vianello; Costantino Vischetti; Luciano Scarponi; Giuseppe Zanin,"Abstract Herbicide runoff and the effects of a narrow vegetative filter strip (VFS) were studied on an arable field in the low-lying plains of the Veneto Region (north-east Italy). Cultivated plots were compared with and without a 6 m wide VFS composed of trees, shrubs and grass. Natural and simulated runoff were monitored during 2000 and 2001. Herbicides applied on the field were: metolachlor (2184–2254 g ha−1), terbuthylazine (1000–1127 g ha−1) and isoproturon (1000 g ha−1). The VFS reduced both runoff depth (10.2–91.2%) and herbicide losses (85.7–97.9%) in the monitored rainfall events. Total herbicide loss with runoff was low (0.69–3.98 g ha−1 without VFS, less than 0.27 g ha−1 with VFS), but concentrations were sometimes very high, especially of terbuthylazine and isoproturon during the first events after treatment. In these events there was a high probability of exceeding the ecotoxicological endpoint for algae, but the VFS helped to reduce the potential risk. Two VFS effectiveness mechanisms were identified: (i) dilution, and (ii) a “sponge-like” effect, which temporarily trapped chemicals inside the VFS before releasing them.",61,5,717,725,Pesticide; Terbuthylazine; Metolachlor; Filter strip; Phytotoxicity; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Agronomy; Arable land; Environmental engineering; Water pollution,,"Acetamides/analysis; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Eukaryota; Festuca; Fishes; Herbicides/analysis; Phenylurea Compounds/analysis; Rain; Risk Assessment; Soil Pollutants/analysis; Triazines/analysis; Viburnum; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis; Water Pollution/prevention & control","Acetamides; Herbicides; Phenylurea Compounds; Soil Pollutants; Triazines; Water Pollutants, Chemical; isoproturon; terbutylazine; metolachlor",,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005Chmsp..61..717V/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16219506 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653505004546 https://core.ac.uk/display/53404823 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653505004546,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.03.043,16219506,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.03.043,2038145559,,0,011-230-574-777-701; 020-537-450-372-975; 024-556-636-186-088; 025-131-472-929-81X; 028-034-500-501-517; 034-195-159-242-383; 041-595-642-229-417; 044-327-313-877-518; 055-486-051-386-205; 065-427-966-967-115; 072-053-332-217-590; 072-742-147-675-34X; 078-927-735-353-813; 079-562-504-772-874; 082-425-030-497-387; 082-797-391-654-568; 083-528-691-484-522; 103-148-967-328-600; 107-861-247-559-610; 115-642-860-718-878; 135-211-483-825-15X; 138-643-821-809-522; 150-226-384-158-289; 178-140-173-536-98X; 197-154-241-626-829,55

Geoff Wang; Zongxing Wang; Xi Duan; Yi Dong; Xiangrong Cheng,"In a Metasequoia glyptostroboides coastal forest shelterbelt near Shanghai, China, we studied relationships between stand structure and wind shelter effect. We located 16 plots at intervals of 500 m along the shelterbelt and characterized both horizontal and vertical structure of each plot. Wind speed was measured within each plot and at different distances windward and leeward. We found that wind shelter effects were closely related to stand structure of the studied M. glyptostroboides shelterbelt. Stands with high basal area but intermediate crown index and intermediate proportion of large trees (LT) produced the best shelter effects, with significantly longer shelter distance (d70, shelter distance which the wind speed U does not exceed 70 % of U;  0) and slightly lower minimum relative wind speed (U;  m;  /U;  0). Simple structural indices that can be easily measured in the field were good predictors of the shelter effect.

Peak; Frank R. Thompson; Terry L. Shaffer,"Abstract We investigated factors affecting nest success of songbirds in riparian forest and buffers in northeastern Missouri. We used an information-theoretic approach to determine support for hypotheses concerning effects of nest-site, habitat-patch, edge, and temporal factors on nest success of songbirds in three narrow (55–95 m) and three wide (400–530 m) riparian forests with adjacent grassland-shrub buffer strips and in three narrow and three wide riparian forests without adjacent grassland-shrub buffer strips. We predicted that temporal effects would have the most support and that habitat-patch and edge effects would have little support, because nest predation would be great across all sites in the highly fragmented, predominantly agricultural landscape. Interval nest success was 0.404, 0.227, 0.070, and 0.186, respectively, for Gray Catbird (Dumetella carolinensis), Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), and forest interior species pooled (Acadian Flycatcher [...",121,3,726,737,Riparian zone; Riparian forest; Predation; Ecology; Geography; Passerina; Catbird; Bunting; Cardinalis cardinalis; Buffer strip,,,,,https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/5649 https://www.bioone.org/journals/the-auk/volume-121/issue-3/0004-8038(2004)121%5b0726%3aFASNSI%5d2.0.CO%3b2/FACTORS-AFFECTING-SONGBIRD-NEST-SURVIVAL-IN-RIPARIAN-FORESTS-IN-A/10.1642/0004-8038(2004)121[0726:FASNSI]2.0.CO;2.full https://academic.oup.com/auk/article/121/3/726/5561887 https://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.1642/0004-8038%282004%29121%5B0726%3AFASNSI%5D2.0.CO%3B2 https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/jrnl/2004/nc_2004_peak_001.pdf https://www.jstor.org/stable/4090310 https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70026938,http://dx.doi.org/10.1642/0004-8038(2004)121[0726:fasnsi]2.0.co;2,,10.1642/0004-8038(2004)121[0726:fasnsi]2.0.co;2,2129877746,,0,001-290-689-089-636; 002-487-564-607-271; 007-289-445-927-744; 009-081-300-680-744; 010-121-443-441-90X; 010-249-113-485-785; 010-609-474-563-642; 011-363-201-170-412; 011-750-069-138-326; 012-201-796-747-886; 012-305-242-621-866; 012-390-404-634-862; 012-786-800-731-307; 014-419-926-825-753; 014-464-020-825-346; 016-393-544-685-716; 016-547-862-953-893; 019-496-973-863-948; 019-616-854-986-172; 022-776-900-636-247; 026-400-111-747-18X; 026-825-605-796-532; 027-350-192-422-849; 029-308-556-590-776; 030-210-563-505-496; 034-321-499-939-288; 035-581-751-895-887; 036-994-383-030-776; 039-213-861-036-414; 041-463-040-183-189; 041-728-890-038-763; 042-706-259-099-168; 049-583-561-973-060; 051-273-617-901-663; 054-774-952-190-584; 060-919-763-672-172; 065-985-505-135-291; 068-852-380-628-809; 072-992-416-725-854; 079-261-909-912-581; 079-942-047-893-746; 082-802-246-722-388; 084-250-234-469-178; 084-539-657-164-277; 091-583-867-985-809; 095-629-389-732-853; 096-224-062-729-995; 100-067-578-489-87X; 100-810-636-245-637; 100-828-256-122-972; 104-497-511-076-822; 104-601-178-603-971; 107-818-341-854-639; 109-143-251-065-214; 110-611-735-993-068; 111-085-619-662-631; 113-900-387-576-996; 124-578-255-565-044; 130-211-837-507-609; 139-389-785-551-24X; 140-804-099-486-389; 142-688-209-240-45X; 143-146-474-539-735; 145-082-228-272-951; 146-882-656-337-936; 152-072-465-980-93X; 152-986-465-657-324; 160-650-934-403-441; 170-127-266-701-22X; 187-136-959-925-324; 192-216-725-631-092; 195-713-214-807-136,66

Arango; Jennifer L. Tank,"AbstractN and C cycles in headwater streams are coupled, and land use can modify these cycles by increasing N availability and removing riparian vegetation. To increase our understanding of how land use modifies the controls on N cycling, we quantified rates of 2 microbial N transformations in a total of 18 agricultural and urban streams (with and without riparian buffers) for 3 y to examine how riparian vegetation and land use influence sediment nitrification and denitrification. Nitrification rates were highest in agricultural streams in late spring. Nitrification was not related to streamwater NH4+ concentrations but was positively related to sediment C content (linear regression, r2 = 0.72, p < 0.001). This result suggests that benthic decomposition provided NH4+ (via mineralization) to increase sediment nitrification. Denitrification rates did not differ among landuse types but were positively related to sediment C content and streamwater NO3– concentration (multiple linear regression, R2 = 0.78, p <...",27,1,90,107,Mineralization (soil science); Riparian zone; Nitrification; Ecology; Hydrology; Environmental science; STREAMS; Land use; Cycling; Denitrification; Benthic zone,,,,,https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-the-north-american-benthological-society/volume-27/issue-1/07-024.1/Land-use-influences-the-spatiotemporal-controls-on-nitrification-and-denitrification/10.1899/07-024.1.pdf https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1899/07-024.1 https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-the-north-american-benthological-society/volume-27/issue-1/07-024.1/Land-use-influences-the-spatiotemporal-controls-on-nitrification-and-denitrification/10.1899/07-024.1.short https://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1899/07-024.1 https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1899/07-024.1 https://digitalcommons.cwu.edu/cotsfac/247/ https://digitalcommons.cwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1247&context=cotsfac,http://dx.doi.org/10.1899/07-024.1,,10.1899/07-024.1,2137353294,,0,000-079-952-662-293; 000-465-688-262-375; 003-451-422-132-663; 005-485-781-511-049; 005-707-447-464-620; 008-670-202-807-499; 010-733-657-503-878; 015-342-032-824-51X; 017-796-445-639-127; 020-814-603-271-028; 021-207-457-184-365; 021-264-049-632-756; 022-987-216-088-782; 024-909-570-162-42X; 025-625-308-394-614; 028-802-252-344-012; 029-222-436-511-570; 030-676-020-137-10X; 033-411-869-353-472; 033-893-820-774-529; 038-144-156-237-488; 038-659-320-814-260; 039-425-043-202-104; 041-606-538-207-737; 047-321-013-893-606; 049-875-994-559-898; 050-358-608-073-575; 051-283-831-168-406; 051-894-767-795-028; 052-185-204-640-924; 052-583-560-404-753; 063-426-638-738-383; 065-700-787-249-390; 070-403-551-062-001; 071-384-818-281-947; 073-481-942-779-088; 076-995-908-672-380; 078-395-809-984-737; 084-681-295-670-929; 085-230-940-699-294; 091-758-692-195-881; 095-263-397-244-602; 095-827-862-700-281; 097-400-866-532-844; 102-307-069-255-349; 111-765-441-561-743; 122-888-146-927-705; 126-636-770-174-000; 140-370-280-512-531; 141-101-347-131-583; 146-076-014-964-958; 146-302-958-214-532; 146-358-825-714-675; 146-501-786-667-333; 155-238-296-972-934; 157-001-718-137-232; 160-724-089-947-642; 169-142-982-536-552; 169-607-559-923-667; 181-369-006-545-743; 186-231-509-533-744; 190-027-017-517-824; 192-561-281-096-267,100

Since its inception, thousands of acres of cropland in stream riparian zones have been converted to conservation buffers through the planting of trees and native grasses. The objectives of this study were to determine the phosphorus (P)–sorption characteristics of the surface soil in a 13‐year‐old CRP buffer and an adjacent continuously cropped production area from which the buffer was created and to assess differences in P‐sorption maxima and P‐buffering capacity between the sites. Phosphorus sorption was modeled with both the simple Langmuir and the two‐surface Langmuir equations. There were significant differences in all P‐sorption parameters between the cropped area and the buffer over most of the depth increments studied.

Helmers; Dean E. Eisenhauer; Thomas G. Franti; Michael G. Dosskey,"Vegetative filters (VF) are used to remove sediment and other pollutants from overland flow. When modeling the hydrology of VF, it is often assumed that overland flow is planar, but our research indicates that it can be two-dimensional with converging and diverging pathways. Our hypothesis is that flow convergence will negatively influence the sediment trapping capability of VF. The objectives were to develop a two-dimensional modeling approach for estimating sediment trapping in VF and to investigate the impact of converging overland flow on sediment trapping by VF. In this study, the performance of a VF that has field-scale flow path lengths with uncontrolled flow direction was quantified using field experiments and hydrologic modeling. Simulations of water flow processes were performed using the physically based, distributed model MIKE SHE. A modeling approach that predicts sediment trapping and accounts for converging and diverging flow was developed based on the University of Kentucky sediment filtration model. The results revealed that as flow convergence increases, filter performance decreases, and the impacts are greater at higher flow rates and shorter filter lengths. Convergence that occurs in the contributing field (in-field) upstream of the buffer had a slightly greater impact than convergence that occurred in the filter (in-filter). An area-based convergence ratio was defined that relates the actual flow area in a VF to the theoretical flow area without flow convergence. When the convergence ratio was 0.70, in-filter convergence caused the sediment trapping efficiency to be reduced from 80% for the planar flow condition to 64% for the converging flow condition. When an equivalent convergence occurred in-field, the sediment trapping efficiency was reduced to 57%. Thus, not only is convergence important but the location where convergence occurs can also be important.",48,2,541,555,Hydrological modelling; Soil science; Volumetric flow rate; Filter (large eddy simulation); MIKE SHE; Sediment; Water flow; Hydrology; Environmental science; Distributed element model; Flow (psychology),,,,,http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1585&context=abe_eng_pubs http://elibrary.asabe.org/abstract.asp??JID=3&AID=18328 http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/abe_eng_pubs/302/ https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/biosysengfacpub/662/ https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=1201100 https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1665&context=biosysengfacpub https://works.bepress.com/matthew_helmers/68/ https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5491 http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/21371 http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/ja/ja_helmers002.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/38933088 https://www.srs.fs.fed.us/pubs/21371 https://core.ac.uk/download/38933088.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/2013.18328,,10.13031/2013.18328,2093488077,,0,003-148-094-786-550; 004-933-400-226-990; 013-158-601-419-635; 017-168-449-861-203; 021-860-145-353-993; 022-325-890-159-594; 024-799-639-156-913; 027-988-435-399-704; 028-912-913-842-092; 031-444-429-401-694; 045-573-628-287-109; 057-603-249-735-303; 068-432-148-221-069; 076-826-572-086-275; 082-797-391-654-568; 086-812-760-777-597; 097-054-825-053-530; 111-288-588-656-115; 134-191-656-379-548; 182-906-730-748-020,26

Garbutt; Tim H. Sparks,"This paper reports on a unique resurvey of the composition of a species rich ancient hedgerow in Cambridgeshire, UK, 27 years after the original study. The hedge contained sections that were unmanaged and unaffected by agrochemicals, as well as sections which were cut annually, adjacent to an intensively managed arable field. Between the two surveys there was a general decline in species richness in all sections of the hedge, particularly in ground flora normally associated with ancient woodland. A mean of 0.42 woody species per 30-m length of hedgerow was lost in 27 years. Contrary to a priori expectation, there was no suggestion that damage was greater in the farmed section.

The distribution of this species on the site was strongly related to landscape connectivity. Occupied habitats are the least isolated from a source of colonizers. Connectivity measured as the distance to the nearest occupied site calculated along the hedgerow network and weighted by the quality of their wooded elements (WD) is a good predictor of the distribution of Abax parallelepipedus in the study area. Many landscape changes have occured between 1952 and 1993 both in the structure and the quality of the wooded network in this area. As a consequence, functional isolation between sample sites has increased by 28% since 1952. The results indicate that the current distribution of Abax parallelepipedus in the network is significantly better related to the 1952 landscape than to the current one. This may indicate the existence of a time lag between landscape changes and the reaction of Abax parallelepipedus to such modifications. The relationship remains the same over a broad range of spatial scales.

Its most common parasitoid is Copidosoma aretas (Walker) (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea: Encyrtidae). To identify selective flowering plants that could be used to increase functional biodiversity, the longevity of C. aretas and its host A. comariana was assessed on 5 flowering species: buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum Moench (Caryophyllales: Polygonaceae); borage, Borago officinalis L. (Boraginaceae); strawberry, Fragaria x ananassa Duchesne (Rosales: Rosaceae); phacelia, Phacelia tanacetifolia Bentham (Boraginaceae); and dill, Anethum graveolens L. (Apiales: Apiaceae). Dill was only tested with C. aretas. Sucrose and pollen served as positive controls, and pure water as a negative control. In a subsequent field experiment, A. comariana larval density was assessed at 1, 6, and 11 m distances from buckwheat flower strips in 3 fields. The proportion of field-collected larvae that were parasitized by C. aretas or fungi was assessed. Among the tested floral diets, buckwheat was superior for C. aretas, increasing its longevity by 1.4 times compared to water. Although buckwheat also increased longevity of A. comariana, its longevity and survival on buckwheat, borage, and strawberry was not significantly different, so buckwheat was chosen for field experiments. A. comariana densities in the 3 fields with sown buckwheat flower strips were 0.5, 4.0, and 8.3 larvae per m per row of strawberry respectively. Of the collected larvae, a total of 1%, 39%, and 65% were parasitized by C. aretas, respectively. The density of A. comariana and the proportion parasitized by C. aretas were highly significantly correlated. Distance from floral strips had no significant effect on either A. comariana larval density or on the proportion of individuals parasitized by C. aretas. Few other parasitoids emerged from collected larvae, and no larvae were infected by entomopathogenic fungi. Still, total A. comariana mortality was significantly affected by distance to flower strips, with the highest mortality near the flower strips. As no effect of buckwheat flower strips on C. aretas parasitism was found, the positive effect they had on A. comariana control stems from unknown mortality factors. As literature indicates that buckwheat for flower strips can augment a more complex suite of natural enemies, one such mortality factor could be a non-consumptive predator and/or parasitoid effect, but this requires further study. If confirmed, buckwheat may be utilized together with a selective food plant, once identified.",13,1,104,104,Biological pest control; PEST analysis; Phacelia tanacetifolia; Phacelia; Fagopyrum; Fragaria; Acleris comariana; Polygonaceae; Botany; Biology,,"Anethum graveolens/growth & development; Animals; Borago/growth & development; Denmark; Fagopyrum/growth & development; Female; Flowers/growth & development; Food Chain; Fragaria/growth & development; Fungi/physiology; Hydrophyllaceae/growth & development; Larva/growth & development; Longevity; Magnoliopsida/growth & development; Male; Moths/growth & development; Ovum/growth & development; Pest Control, Biological/methods; Pupa/growth & development; Wasps/growth & development",,,https://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1673/031.013.10401 https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-insect-science/volume-13/issue-104/031.013.10401/The-Effect-of-Floral-Resources-on-Parasitoid-and-Host-Longevity/10.1673/031.013.10401.full https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-insect-science/volume-13/issue-104/031.013.10401/The-Effect-of-Floral-Resources-on-Parasitoid-and-Host-Longevity/10.1673/031.013.10401.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4011335 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738921 https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/13/1/104/1751707 http://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article-abstract/13/1/104/1751707,http://dx.doi.org/10.1673/031.013.10401,24738921,10.1673/031.013.10401,2085429442,PMC4011335,0,008-753-821-057-125; 011-099-029-942-088; 015-047-726-615-614; 015-648-440-419-195; 019-919-524-512-204; 020-026-253-418-554; 022-561-074-388-561; 023-428-736-050-054; 035-277-132-266-700; 040-438-898-588-485; 041-720-279-642-994; 042-195-189-711-603; 044-405-697-969-681; 044-604-341-963-870; 048-526-486-928-659; 052-714-747-024-475; 054-064-795-729-462; 060-060-746-294-537; 063-087-645-624-559; 068-585-950-670-977; 071-874-605-936-921; 074-860-251-070-527; 075-556-171-377-545; 076-349-963-255-639; 082-605-892-768-804; 083-110-500-875-419; 089-273-556-971-236; 091-107-460-491-834; 092-885-777-557-835; 093-271-491-167-620; 095-026-354-929-83X; 095-585-921-316-601; 098-275-229-793-108; 106-878-921-917-083; 107-932-619-110-538; 108-770-051-838-223; 111-224-755-509-575; 115-637-724-065-116; 116-970-112-350-173; 117-319-504-327-830; 118-517-805-402-236; 124-314-459-350-812; 124-657-871-276-946; 125-451-702-999-329; 131-786-066-922-719; 134-139-780-384-880; 134-177-253-072-946; 138-410-158-813-551; 142-846-332-982-038; 156-130-830-556-87X; 162-203-998-248-020; 171-504-783-181-426; 181-978-260-062-898; 194-595-863-937-394; 196-401-284-732-508,32

Brandle,"ABSTRACT: Effectiveness of filter strips may change over a period of years because key soil and vegetation conditions change after conversion of cultivated farmland to permanent vegetation. The main objectives of this study were to: 1) determine if effectiveness of a filter strip changes over years since establishment, and 2) determine if temporal change depends on vegetation type. Four vegetation treatments were replicated five times in 3 × 7.5 m (10 × 25 ft) plots. Plots containing all-grass (New Grass) and grass with trees and shrubs (New Forest) were established in spring of 1995 among otherwise similar plots that contained either grass since ca. 1970 (Old Grass) or were re-cultivated and re-planted annually with grain sorghum (Crop). Once each summer, in 1995, 1996, 1997, 2003, and 2004, identically prepared solutions containing sediment, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer, and bromide tracer were applied to the upper end of each plot during a simulated rainfall event of 2.5 cm (1 in) in 30 minutes, and the load and concentration of runoff components were measured in outflow from the plots. Retention of solution components and reduction of their concentrations by the New Grass and New Forest plots improved from effectiveness similar or less than the Crop plots to effectiveness similar to the Old Grass plots within three growing seasons. Improvement coincided with the development of denser vegetative ground cover and a slower rate of runoff flow through the plots. Change in infiltration accounted for most of the improvement in overall effectiveness. There was no evidence of divergence in the performance of New Grass and New Forest plots. We conclude that filter strip performance improves over a period of years since establishment. Most of the change occurs within three growing seasons after establishment. Infiltration characteristics account for most of that change. Grass and forest vegetation are equally effective as filter strips for at least 10 growing seasons after establishment.",62,1,21,32,Infiltration (hydrology); Growing season; Sorghum; Vegetation type; Fertilizer; Filter strip; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Nitrogen; Agronomy,,,,,https://www.jswconline.org/content/62/1/21.full.pdf https://www.jswconline.org/content/62/1/21 http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/ja/ja_dosskey005.pdf http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/26942 https://www.srs.fs.fed.us/pubs/26942,https://www.jswconline.org/content/62/1/21,,,2116566905,,0,000-420-455-789-45X; 002-937-270-631-538; 004-933-400-226-990; 005-046-617-641-306; 006-176-134-679-950; 009-586-998-362-572; 009-742-460-635-737; 013-487-233-481-079; 014-561-967-561-763; 017-885-841-853-429; 023-025-184-153-242; 023-889-860-756-398; 029-227-515-568-324; 032-031-027-467-560; 034-748-846-517-673; 035-134-609-293-178; 036-466-585-417-013; 038-439-180-047-201; 038-659-320-814-260; 044-401-317-828-273; 045-573-628-287-109; 056-025-688-669-098; 058-218-489-015-546; 061-560-919-049-562; 068-858-373-687-429; 073-564-601-864-691; 073-926-597-326-182; 076-826-572-086-275; 077-809-529-196-235; 084-156-857-036-757; 086-873-034-193-158; 087-142-362-977-119; 088-017-310-971-747; 088-236-621-248-724; 102-307-069-255-349; 103-148-967-328-600; 103-286-115-762-912; 104-916-636-873-124; 108-877-669-911-453; 109-376-461-877-242; 111-288-588-656-115; 111-299-180-503-936; 113-496-738-919-590; 115-642-860-718-878; 116-143-523-953-527; 123-334-480-318-27X; 134-191-656-379-548; 158-645-409-289-179; 160-843-688-361-688; 166-533-905-914-141; 170-256-364-738-510; 175-302-560-900-147; 182-906-730-748-020; 183-143-735-590-924,48

Bartelt-Hunt; Seth J. Lamb; Xu Li; David B. Marx; Daniel D. Snow; David B. Parker; Brian L. Woodbury,"Abstract. The effectiveness of a narrow grass hedge in reducing runoff nutrient loads following swine slurry application was examined. Slurry was applied to 0.75 m wide by 4.0 m long plots established on an Aksarben silty clay loam soil located in southeast Nebraska. Manure treatments consisted of no manure application and manure application to meet the 1, 2, or 3 year nitrogen (N) requirements for corn. Runoff water quality was measured during three 30 min simulated rainfall events. The grass hedge did not significantly reduce runoff nutrient transport after the swine slurry, which contained relatively small amounts of manure, was applied. Increasing the N application rate from a 1 year to a 3 year corn N requirement also did not result in a significant increase in N or phosphorus (P) loads in runoff. The grass hedge significantly reduced electrical conductivity (EC) measurements from 0.78 to 0.73 dS m -1 and pH values from 8.16 to 7.85. The rates of transport of dissolved P, particulate P, and total P were each influenced by runoff rate and increased in a linear fashion from 7 to 25, 65 to 357, and 72 to 382 g ha -1 min -1 , respectively. Runoff rate significantly affected rates of transport of NO 3 -N, NH 4 -N, and total nitrogen, which increased in a linear fashion from 273 to 1204, 30 to 47, and 323 to 1490 g ha -1 min -1 , respectively. Runoff rate is an important variable that should be considered when estimating nutrient transport following application of swine slurry containing relatively small amounts of nutrients.",56,4,1441,1450,Loam; Animal science; Nutrient; Manure management; Water quality; Manure; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Phosphorus; Slurry,,,,,https://experts.nebraska.edu/en/publications/narrow-grass-hedge-effects-on-nutrient-transport-following-swine-,https://experts.nebraska.edu/en/publications/narrow-grass-hedge-effects-on-nutrient-transport-following-swine-,,,3022735792,,0,,1

Peyret-Guzzon; H. Stockinger; Marie-Lara Bouffaud; P. Farcy; Daniel Wipf; Dirk Redecker,"Short-term effects of soil physical disturbance by ploughing and nitrogen and phosphate fertilisation on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities and on intraspecific populations of Rhizophagus irregularis in a buffer strip surrounded by arable fields were studied. Pre-grown Plantago lanceolata plantlets were transplanted into fertilised and/or ploughed experimental plots. After 3 months, the glomeromycotan communities in the roots of these trap plants were analysed using 454 pyrosequencing of a fragment of the RNA polymerase II gene (RPB1). Intraspecific populations of R. irregularis were studied by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mtLSU) gene. Soil disturbance significantly increased the diversity of species-level molecular taxa (MTs) and altered community structure, whilst fertilisation alone had no significant effect, unless coupled with ploughing. At the population level, the expected shift from genotypes of R. irregularis typically found in grasslands to those usually found in arable sites was only partially observed. In conclusion, in the short-term, physical soil disturbance, as well as nitrogen fertilisation when coupled with physical soil disturbance, affected AMF community and to a smaller extent population composition.",26,1,33,46,Intraspecific competition; Tillage; Soil microbiology; Plantago; Glomeromycota; Rhizophagus irregularis; Population; Mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit; Botany; Agronomy; Biology,Fertilisation; Glomeromycota; Next-generation sequencing; RPB1; Tillage; mtLSU,"Agriculture; DNA, Fungal/genetics; DNA, Mitochondrial/genetics; DNA, Ribosomal/genetics; Fertilizers; Genetic Variation; Glomeromycota/genetics; Grassland; Mitochondrial Ribosomes/microbiology; Mycorrhizae/metabolism; Plant Roots/microbiology; RNA Polymerase II/genetics; Ribosome Subunits, Large/genetics; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Soil/chemistry; Soil Microbiology; Symbiosis","DNA, Fungal; DNA, Mitochondrial; DNA, Ribosomal; Fertilizers; Soil; RNA Polymerase II",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26023005 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26023005 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00572-015-0644-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-015-0644-5,26023005,10.1007/s00572-015-0644-5,354332701,,0,000-258-394-607-321; 000-342-129-682-20X; 001-508-659-720-270; 002-062-773-284-348; 002-237-159-846-242; 002-922-172-871-288; 003-457-752-020-709; 004-177-538-756-029; 004-886-406-725-804; 006-204-275-070-095; 007-487-002-906-765; 007-487-225-665-225; 009-024-708-095-222; 009-654-652-725-569; 010-996-696-765-20X; 011-592-201-871-787; 013-085-234-861-928; 013-178-590-573-423; 013-315-949-569-948; 018-825-350-800-308; 019-265-781-516-96X; 020-511-403-548-805; 020-886-419-586-348; 021-160-565-119-303; 021-802-550-357-060; 023-223-502-010-958; 025-732-003-182-155; 025-978-696-789-397; 026-317-942-977-966; 026-471-006-098-657; 027-122-185-941-195; 029-392-194-722-94X; 029-604-326-655-26X; 032-293-126-022-233; 032-649-969-710-071; 032-720-882-006-304; 033-543-257-728-557; 035-630-824-472-489; 037-291-877-208-197; 037-675-783-906-560; 039-052-305-139-274; 039-564-007-998-248; 039-797-825-045-42X; 040-749-552-540-597; 040-961-946-298-041; 041-420-123-771-330; 041-927-075-515-908; 042-042-884-399-01X; 042-087-489-369-709; 043-085-726-185-397; 045-083-253-677-407; 045-880-527-116-423; 047-327-157-208-409; 048-913-425-354-890; 051-641-076-046-284; 053-778-152-853-409; 054-295-891-332-535; 055-098-259-934-114; 055-107-493-085-079; 057-339-668-171-389; 060-114-103-966-089; 060-716-506-165-508; 061-523-157-907-15X; 061-578-200-952-967; 063-141-893-182-571; 063-534-204-761-656; 064-982-528-864-93X; 066-697-407-924-983; 067-933-030-059-026; 069-111-742-788-18X; 070-264-341-342-729; 071-380-704-467-390; 073-320-944-874-188; 076-262-730-021-75X; 078-516-125-518-645; 079-504-693-815-988; 081-077-391-819-340; 083-235-458-956-66X; 085-074-679-407-910; 086-755-460-290-244; 093-085-443-425-323; 096-525-221-032-992; 097-576-977-180-377; 102-880-767-966-73X; 103-545-688-305-288; 103-586-810-797-724; 104-715-530-343-714; 106-928-723-003-013; 108-463-785-279-31X; 110-279-024-749-825; 112-032-342-644-584; 112-397-017-997-396; 118-303-027-486-467; 120-506-913-514-639; 126-037-332-142-477; 128-338-757-016-11X; 128-913-131-309-525; 129-601-073-322-134; 130-349-959-182-242; 142-026-096-719-567; 150-325-162-873-23X; 162-244-031-910-177; 176-272-377-119-610; 179-350-079-918-49X; 182-628-814-881-147; 184-840-323-146-43X,28

The objective of this study was to assess the efficiency of 0-m, 3-m, 6-m and 9-m grass filter strips to reduce masses of dissolved metolachlor, atrazine and deethylatrazine (a degradation product of atrazine) exported in runoff. For that purpose, 16 uncultivated plots (3-m wide × 65-m long) with 0-m-, 3-m-, 6-m- and 9-m-long grass filter strips were setup in a completely randomized block design. During four seasons, masses of dissolved atrazine, metolachlor and deethylatrazine were determined for the first four to five rain events, under natural rain conditions, after atrazine and metolachlor application. Generally, grass filter strips reduced exported herbicide masses by more than 90% and influenced atrazine and metolachlor dissipation kinetics in the field. The 3-m grass filter strip (area ratio source/strip of 22:1) usually provided a reduction in exported herbicide masses similar to the 6- or 9-m grass filter strips. Therefore, under the present experimental soil and climate conditions, a grass filter strip of 3 m would be a good compromise between environmental protection of surface waters against atrazine and metolachlor contamination and conservation of agricultural land use. Such an approach contributes to the acceptability by producers to implement optimized best management practices such as vegetated filter strips for the preservation of the quality of water resources.",29,1,87,97,Contamination; Filter (aquarium); Randomized block design; Metolachlor; Atrazine; Filter strip; Area ratio; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Agronomy,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/sum.12016 http://espace.inrs.ca/3462/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.12016,,10.1111/sum.12016,1967158637,,0,002-650-706-842-54X; 002-937-270-631-538; 005-046-617-641-306; 007-985-273-091-256; 011-230-574-777-701; 011-648-696-888-176; 011-862-201-131-487; 016-084-115-518-996; 019-057-578-554-139; 021-655-763-861-159; 022-491-237-741-390; 024-556-636-186-088; 024-998-467-249-663; 034-730-675-555-708; 041-445-679-738-588; 045-878-014-461-966; 046-446-501-703-050; 049-252-519-382-412; 052-320-986-023-291; 052-589-530-283-548; 055-290-465-789-317; 061-132-610-678-87X; 078-927-735-353-813; 086-496-072-727-834; 096-878-710-039-072; 099-719-046-892-307; 119-010-695-168-082; 122-905-248-651-828; 135-035-993-428-592; 140-070-172-179-298; 142-357-890-022-237; 143-773-294-577-147; 147-693-440-321-04X; 151-498-245-092-772; 181-090-792-931-175; 182-906-730-748-020,11

We monitored the change of species richness and abundance of hoverflies along three transects in the hedgerow and in the wheat field in different distances (10 m, 20 m) from the hedgerow. The effect of sampling methods on the number of hoverfly species and individuals was analyzed. Two sampling methods were used to catch hoverflies: netting and pan traps. The whole sampling period was divided into three subperiods, which are early (22nd April–2nd June), middle (11th June–1st August) and late (6th August–11th September). Altogether 1,214 individuals of 22 species were sampled. Fourteen species with 78% of individuals belonged to the aphidophagous group, feeding on aphids as larvae. Altogether 861 individuals of 22 hoverfly species were sampled by netting and 353 individuals of 10 species by pan traps. The total number of hoverfly species was significant lower in the late period than in the early. The total abundance was higher in the middle period compared to the early. The species richness and abundance of aphidophagous species followed a similar pattern as the total species values. The species richness and abundance of hoverflies were significant higher in 10 m and 20 m distance in the wheat field than along the hedgerow. The results suggest that the pan traps were less efficient in the hedgerow than the netting, but in the wheat field they sampled more hoverflies because of visually alluring effect on hoverflies in the absence of flowers.",69,3,381,388,Pollinator; Larva; Ecology; Hoverfly; Netting; Species richness; Transect; Arable land; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,http://core.ac.uk/display/19563876 https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/biolog.2014.69.issue-3/s11756-013-0315-y/s11756-013-0315-y.xml https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/241115 https://link.springer.com/article/10.2478/s11756-013-0315-y https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/biolog.2014.69.issue-3/s11756-013-0315-y/s11756-013-0315-y.xml,http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-013-0315-y,,10.2478/s11756-013-0315-y,2132177090,,0,000-890-614-606-582; 006-126-944-893-638; 007-243-303-723-240; 007-983-470-095-396; 009-012-164-159-153; 010-988-063-797-121; 014-065-020-413-191; 016-732-887-099-309; 018-959-906-131-888; 022-771-502-946-159; 025-162-529-099-143; 029-433-936-125-211; 032-309-609-339-669; 037-649-247-809-59X; 037-801-316-449-334; 039-622-275-777-057; 041-308-563-905-232; 043-243-299-576-545; 052-951-584-268-481; 053-611-828-022-484; 054-574-655-639-908; 056-585-869-238-25X; 062-554-425-020-511; 066-789-108-328-40X; 068-452-604-669-157; 070-573-740-499-634; 077-447-609-165-556; 080-603-556-908-327; 081-346-750-789-589; 090-065-520-860-63X; 091-274-237-112-529; 094-448-753-890-34X; 094-506-716-348-263; 098-492-558-088-638; 100-841-122-046-376; 102-475-614-737-400; 106-707-090-644-523; 107-188-835-457-613; 113-790-282-907-897; 114-519-845-592-808; 116-960-911-906-722; 126-322-219-192-539; 127-747-168-852-33X; 129-124-193-818-311; 137-105-318-357-659; 150-275-342-089-773; 161-726-640-746-005; 164-059-355-030-246; 188-074-330-681-030,7

We surveyed the vegetation of field boundaries in organic and non-organic farms, recorded the field boundary type and width. We characterized landscape structure around the vegetation plots (r = 250 m). We classified plant species into two ecological response groups: (1) common weeds and other species occurring frequently on agricultural land, i.e. ‘agrotolerant species’ (47 species), and (2) all other species intolerant to contemporary agricultural practices—so-called ‘nature-value species’ (190 species). We analysed the effect of organic farming, boundary type and landscape structure on the diversity of these two species groups. We found that field boundary type and landscape structure described most of the variation in species composition of these boundaries, while organic farming had little effect. However, the analysis of plant species diversity revealed that organic farming significantly supported the species richness of high nature-value species by increasing species richness on average by two species on 4 m2 plot, while the richness of agrotolerant species did not depend on farming type. Boundary type had a specific impact on species diversity—ditches enhanced the richness of nature-value species and suppressed agrotolerants; woody boundaries hosted only a few agrotolerant species and road verges increased the species richness of both species groups. The richness of nature-value species benefited from wider open boundaries, while narrow boundaries hosted more agrotolerant species.",135,3,178,186,Agriculture; Organic farming; Biodiversity; Vegetation; Ecology; Geography; Rank abundance curve; Agricultural land; Species richness; Agroforestry; Species diversity,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880909002771 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103040347.html http://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND44288404 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880909002771 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103040347,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2009.09.005,,10.1016/j.agee.2009.09.005,1994085189,,0,003-985-399-942-102; 005-769-046-282-205; 006-209-416-467-452; 007-243-303-723-240; 008-524-220-939-553; 010-435-720-029-617; 012-187-317-384-830; 014-005-967-253-86X; 014-835-397-961-006; 015-023-911-974-997; 018-827-921-966-336; 021-177-852-241-142; 021-442-834-836-016; 022-032-010-231-027; 029-264-530-643-997; 029-386-831-957-40X; 031-579-741-921-238; 035-249-007-176-222; 038-316-745-349-398; 039-683-130-720-710; 040-851-297-121-31X; 042-985-809-167-140; 046-117-480-681-720; 046-500-604-745-231; 046-922-146-668-557; 047-546-677-833-03X; 049-774-123-059-115; 054-622-824-887-990; 054-715-078-148-813; 055-839-208-665-650; 056-099-523-856-735; 056-789-845-462-569; 057-720-330-037-206; 059-903-823-021-549; 060-708-377-821-918; 063-003-550-683-547; 063-617-276-329-073; 065-071-886-701-523; 067-354-818-441-267; 070-365-342-030-594; 073-021-383-708-605; 073-170-131-117-322; 075-521-453-779-278; 076-307-235-228-944; 080-213-693-060-517; 085-216-099-100-868; 086-525-130-009-786; 089-479-520-779-940; 095-455-937-190-024; 098-035-451-831-547; 101-656-029-176-741; 102-049-479-595-742; 108-606-742-009-569; 112-169-660-713-159; 115-161-489-792-477; 117-345-687-903-78X; 121-206-630-992-202; 121-270-336-123-002; 130-698-554-759-854; 131-060-331-668-772; 138-312-614-366-937; 141-005-140-982-524; 144-887-196-579-407; 145-863-435-046-625; 147-712-556-583-085; 150-062-616-431-988; 150-827-413-891-88X; 151-368-087-827-60X; 152-084-233-033-659; 152-601-901-059-68X; 155-691-175-864-748; 160-781-907-593-622; 161-072-580-272-396; 166-826-142-461-007; 167-196-987-930-306; 175-927-412-841-616; 176-506-367-701-104; 176-664-883-657-81X; 180-157-128-386-145; 184-621-408-258-203; 186-739-979-596-835; 187-941-892-082-802; 188-468-956-254-948; 188-597-703-306-560,55

Fry,"Abstract The interactions of predatory arthropods between natural habitats and arable land were explored. Three questions were asked: (1) Does habitat quality in field margins determine the density of natural enemies overwintering in field margins? (2) Are good sites for natural enemies also habitats which support greater general arthropod diversity? (3) Does the density of predators overwintering in field margins determine their distribution and abundance in adjacent cereal fields in spring? The value of field margins to agriculture was assessed as the density of arthropods overwintering in these habitats. The arthropod groups used for the assessment were known aphid predators which moved out into cereal crops in the spring. This assessment was compared with general arthropod diversity at each site to test whether field margins supporting high densities of predators were also of value to nature conservation in supporting greater arthropod biodiversity. In spring, the spatial dynamics of predatory arthropod species were investigated in cereal crops adjacent to field-margin overwintering sites. The influence of field-margin habitats on natural enemy populations within adjacent crops was evaluated. The enhancement of natural enemies and general arthropod conservation are discussed as components of overall biological diversity at the farm scale.",40,1-4,95,115,Biodiversity; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Population density; Overwintering; Arthropod; Beneficial insects; Arable land; Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016788099290086Q https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19921164921 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19921164921.html http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=NL9205852,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0167-8809(92)90086-q,,10.1016/0167-8809(92)90086-q,2044753654,,0,002-086-095-851-118; 016-476-220-285-090; 016-823-705-101-257; 017-142-360-466-615; 020-676-426-681-604; 022-070-333-305-083; 023-487-127-123-633; 023-851-975-669-59X; 024-039-271-253-659; 028-106-119-563-735; 029-274-571-592-996; 031-104-721-708-756; 032-518-812-117-974; 036-360-672-726-628; 041-047-966-691-424; 045-045-361-610-077; 047-233-893-807-760; 051-103-549-479-234; 060-626-812-234-007; 063-670-046-308-472; 065-711-762-339-318; 069-379-822-515-162; 069-622-233-079-646; 071-193-883-830-779; 073-088-189-612-606; 075-781-408-578-136; 076-355-879-729-476; 077-894-208-740-665; 082-782-980-105-338; 087-186-786-234-321; 089-824-296-465-609; 103-540-661-878-884; 106-595-024-453-59X; 116-539-169-434-804; 120-961-507-568-759; 126-185-854-218-293; 128-236-973-422-860; 128-563-062-429-007; 132-775-784-488-585; 134-890-565-889-22X; 137-360-755-261-936; 137-715-556-349-142; 148-680-462-415-331; 155-441-042-474-752; 187-050-769-304-212,230

Knight,"Caragana shelterbelts are a common feature of farms in the Northern Great Plains of North America. We investigated if nitrogen (N) from this leguminous shrub contributed to the N nutrition of triticale and oat forage crops growing adjacent to the shelterbelt row. Nitrogen transfer was measured using 15N isotope dilution at distances of  2 m, 4 m, 6 m, 15 m and 20 m from the shelterbelt. At 2 m caragana negatively impacted the growth of triticale and oat. At 4 m from the shelterbelt productivity was maximum for both forage crops and corresponded to the highest amount of N originating from caragana. The amount of N transferred from caragana decreased linearly with distance away from the shelterbelt, but even at 20 m from the shelterbelt row measureable amounts of N originating from caragana were detectable in the forage biomass. At 4 m from the shelterbelt approximately 40% of the N in both oat and triticale was from caragana, and at 20 m from the shelterbelt approximately 20% of the N in oat and 8% of the N in triticale was from caragana",6,12,1922,1932,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f6061922,,10.3390/f6061922,,,0,002-466-962-536-728; 004-958-155-123-939; 014-723-808-163-820; 016-461-382-299-215; 017-640-430-568-126; 017-868-426-428-164; 018-912-213-938-218; 022-648-804-684-488; 029-386-528-575-804; 029-658-618-493-999; 030-468-316-988-281; 035-881-737-687-728; 036-315-734-250-926; 042-161-051-609-74X; 048-069-722-449-609; 050-947-389-825-743; 062-123-822-138-703; 063-611-161-419-741; 064-239-686-824-334; 074-300-608-160-838; 089-268-129-642-829; 123-782-511-048-153; 161-671-403-526-169,4

Helmers; Xiaobo Zhou; Heidi Asbjornsen; Randy Kolka; Mark D. Tomer; Richard M. Cruse,"Twelve small watersheds in central Iowa were used to evaluate the eff ectiveness of prairie filter strips (PFS) in trapping sediment from agricultural runoff. Four treatments with PFS of different size and location (100% rowcrop, 10% PFS of total watershed area at footslope, 10% PFS at footslope and in contour strips, 20% PFS at footslope and in contour strips) arranged in a balanced incomplete block design were seeded in July 2007. All watersheds were in bromegrass (Bromus L.) for at least 10 yr before treatment establishment. Cropped areas were managed under a no-till, 2-yr corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max. (L.) Merr.] rotation beginning in 2007. About 38 to 85% of the total sediment export from cropland occurred during the early growth stage of rowcrop due to wet field conditions and poor ground cover. The greatest sediment load was observed in 2008 due to the initial soil disturbance and gradually decreased thereafter. The mean annual sediment yield through 2010 was 0.36 and 8.30 Mg ha-1 for the watersheds with and without PFS, respectively, a 96% sediment trapping efficiency for the 4-yr study period. The amount and distribution of PFS had no significant impact on runoff and sediment yield, probably due to the relatively large width (37-78m) of footslope PFS. The findings suggest that incorporation of PFS at the footslope position of annual rowcrop systems provides an effective approach to reducing sediment loss in runoff from agricultural watersheds under a no-till system.",41,5,1531,1539,Bromus; Sediment; Sediment yield; Zea mays; Agricultural runoff; Field conditions; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Agronomy; Ephemeral key,,Agriculture/methods; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Pollution/prevention & control; Geologic Sediments/analysis; Iowa; Rain,,U.S. Department of Agriculture,http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1592&context=abe_eng_pubs https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2134/jeq2011.0473 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/abe_eng_pubs/313/ https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/46982 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23099945 https://works.bepress.com/matthew_helmers/46/ https://srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/46982 https://www.fs.fed.us/nrs/pubs/jrnl/2012/nrs_2012_helmers_001.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/38933409 https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/41/5/1531 https://core.ac.uk/download/38933409.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2011.0473,23099945,10.2134/jeq2011.0473,2078025586,,0,000-289-215-850-070; 003-148-094-786-550; 010-411-455-963-25X; 018-103-292-961-116; 019-057-578-554-139; 024-043-475-626-80X; 025-714-041-289-368; 026-957-575-684-664; 030-682-084-703-597; 038-757-810-328-360; 043-112-228-081-457; 049-252-519-382-412; 062-902-870-719-134; 064-318-710-836-745; 064-922-510-478-219; 066-727-776-146-130; 068-914-263-542-724; 069-017-554-160-976; 072-164-353-760-56X; 075-667-485-324-237; 076-826-572-086-275; 078-870-777-882-17X; 080-894-085-139-156; 081-036-286-472-452; 086-278-743-531-248; 087-168-688-204-963; 087-573-289-968-877; 087-680-309-241-290; 090-235-730-566-753; 092-498-166-624-699; 096-740-607-399-81X; 101-436-533-216-728; 105-484-476-935-241; 108-701-815-281-033; 111-288-588-656-115; 126-961-510-728-424; 134-902-235-027-980; 135-138-272-402-482; 138-651-648-737-878; 146-606-352-041-123; 168-424-180-911-647; 183-143-735-590-924; 198-427-699-712-670,82

A primary; impact of use has been the removal of riparian trees, the; crowns and roots of which provide shade and stream bank protection.; Increases in water temperature can be lethal to salmonid fish,; and decreasing salmon populations over the past few decades have; resulted in an urgent need for improving the management of watersheds,; fish habitat, and water quality. Leaving stream-side buffers; is now required by state forest practices regulations on forest; lands, but no regulations are in place on agricultural lands, where; riparian trees have frequently been removed.; In 1995, the Beaver Creek Riparian Buffer Project was established; to develop better information about how to establish riparian; buffers on coastal pastureland near Newport, Oregon. No riparian; trees were present when the trial was begun. A replicated; tree filter belt trial was established along the south bank of the creek; to compare unplanted pasture (controls) with commercially valued; red alder (Alnus rubra) planted at 6-ft spacing in belts 1 row, 3; rows, and 6 rows wide. Tree survival and height and diameter; growth were compared, as well as the amount of shade produced; by the three treatments and control. We used a LI-COR LAI-2000; Plant Canopy Analyzer to quantify shade.

055-290-465-789-317,"Nitrogen removal in subsurface water by narrow buffer strips in the intensive farming landscape of the Po River watershed, Italy",,2011,journal article,Ecological Engineering,09258574,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Raffaella Balestrini; Cristina Arese; Carlo Andrea Delconte; Alessandro Lotti; Franco Salerno,"Abstract In many countries buffer strips have become an important management tool widely accepted for controlling the diffuse pollution and supporting the development of more sustainable agriculture. However, there is the need to investigate their role in intensive farming systems where a realistic and shareable proposal to realize buffer strips can only foresee the use of a limited space. We evaluated the nitrogen buffering capacities of two narrow riparian strips (5–8 m) along irrigation ditches located in a typical flat agricultural watershed of the alluvial plain of the River Po (Northern Italy). Subsurface water level and nutrient concentrations were monitored along transects of piezometers installed from crop fields to ditches in two different areas. Spatial and temporal variation in water chemistry and hydrology were investigated to individuate the main processes (biological or physical) leading to groundwater nitrate depletion related to fertilization, pluviometric regime and seasonal variation. The results obtained indicate an elevated nitrate removal efficiency in both riparian areas. Compared to the high mean concentrations measured at the exit of the crop fields (10–90 mg l−1 N-NO3−), nitrate levels within riparian sites can be very low, completely disappearing below the ditches. The patterns of some chemical species (O2, SO42− and HCO3−) and the potential denitrification rates suggest that denitrification plays a predominant role in the N-NO3− depletion observed in the first few meters of the herbaceous strip. The key factors in the system are the elevated groundwater residence time and the effect of the evapotranspiration. The water uptake by woody vegetation affects the subsurface water to flow through the riparian zone and, at the same time, it contributes to completely remove the nitrate from the groundwater. Our findings also suggest the double role of riparian vegetation both in ecohydrological and biological terms. In fact the water uptake by trees affects the subsurface flow pattern and contributes to completely remove the nitrate in the riparian zone.",37,2,148,157,Subsurface flow; Riparian zone; Evapotranspiration; Nitrate; Hydrology; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Denitrification; Groundwater; Hydrology (agriculture); Environmental engineering,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857410002582 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/843423 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857410002582,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2010.08.003,,10.1016/j.ecoleng.2010.08.003,2006501585,,0,000-600-406-746-566; 001-699-479-136-901; 002-321-610-856-114; 007-647-947-577-550; 008-467-759-539-985; 014-286-035-791-303; 014-316-223-277-453; 016-848-985-349-10X; 017-709-159-607-177; 019-956-026-948-622; 020-162-258-114-150; 025-790-337-809-216; 035-331-375-703-965; 036-177-171-687-91X; 039-471-920-005-67X; 044-456-125-092-896; 051-607-714-466-701; 052-494-986-045-941; 059-949-847-321-259; 063-921-186-022-381; 067-470-331-652-132; 073-703-019-282-474; 075-429-883-991-330; 075-611-331-410-172; 076-551-861-300-215; 078-812-044-832-284; 080-589-148-600-106; 101-504-801-125-323; 102-901-034-424-714; 126-051-201-417-566; 129-149-313-308-705; 133-007-756-045-351; 147-839-315-927-543; 150-539-908-471-485; 156-008-705-075-664; 164-811-124-878-023; 168-228-690-607-508; 179-775-405-073-482; 186-231-509-533-744,45

F. Boller; U. Remund; M. P. Candolfi,"This paper presents the results of an acarological survey started in 1984 in hedges bordering vineyards in Northern Switzerland where natural populations of the economically important predatory miteTyphlodromus pyri occur. The objective of these investigations was to identify those plant species in the hedges and forest margins adjacent to vineyards that carry high populations of this important predator, and to evaluate the potential role of hedges as ecological refuges and sources ofT. pyri. We found high and consistent densities ofT. pyri onRubus fruticosus, and less regularly onCornus sanguinea, Corylus avellana andLonicara xylosteum. We conclude that hedges can provide ecological refuges and sources of this economically important predatory mite where earlier applications of inappropriate pesticides have eliminated these important antagonists. However, the inoculative release ofT. pyri along with the increase of the internal ecological diversity of the vineyard achieved by proper management of the green over plants (“weed”) will have a strong influence on predator densities within the vineyards.",33,2,249,255,Ecosystem diversity; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Phytoseiidae; Cornus sanguinea; Vineyard; Animal ecology; Biology; Predator,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02372661.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02372661 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19881114399,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf02372661,,10.1007/bf02372661,2037843848,,0,,65

Park,"1. Agricultural intensification and expansion are regarded as major causes of worldwide declines in biodiversity during the last century. Agri-environment schemes (AES) have been introduced in many countries as an attempt to counteract the negative effects of intensive agriculture by providing financial incentives for farmers to adopt environmentally-sensitive agricultural practices. 2. We surveyed 18 pairs of AES and conventionally-managed farms in central Scotland (United Kingdom) to evaluate the effects of specific AES management prescriptions (field margins, hedgerows, species-rich grasslands and water margins) on farmland moths. We also measured the influence of the surrounding landscape on moth populations at three spatial scales (250 m, 500 m and 1 km radii from each trapping site) to assess at which scale management was most important for the conservation of farmland moths. 3. In general, percentage cover of rough grassland and scrub within 250 m of the trapping site was the most important landscape predictor for both micro- and macromoth abundance and macromoth species richness, although negative effects of urbanization were found at wider scales (within 1 km), particularly for macromoth species richness. 4. The abundance and species richness of micromoths was significantly higher within field margins and species-rich grasslands under AES management in comparison to their conventional counterparts, whereas AES water margins increased micromoth abundance, but not species richness. AES species-rich grasslands and water margins were associated with an increased macromoth abundance and species richness, and macromoths considered 'widespread but rapidly declining' also gained some benefits from these two AES prescriptions. In contrast, hedgerows under AES management enhanced neither micromoth nor macromoth populations. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings indicate that increasing the percentage cover of semi-natural environment at a local scale (e.g. within 250 m) benefits both micro- and macromoth populations, and that the implementation of simple AES management prescriptions applied to relatively small areas can increase the species richness and abundance of moth populations in agricultural environments. © 2010 The Authors.

Scheme design is partly based on non-ecological considerations and poses important restrictions on evaluation studies. We describe a robust approach to evaluate agri-environment schemes and use it to evaluate the biodiversity effects of agri-environment schemes in five European countries. We compared species density of vascular plants, birds, bees, grasshoppers and crickets, and spiders on 202 paired fields, one with an agri-environment scheme, the other conventionally managed. In all countries, agri-environment schemes had marginal to moderately positive effects on biodiversity. However, uncommon species benefited in only two of five countries and species listed in Red Data Books rarely benefited from agri-environment schemes. Scheme objectives may need to differentiate between biodiversity of common species that can be enhanced with relatively simple modifications in farming practices and diversity or abundance of endangered species which require more elaborate conservation measures.",9,3,243,254,Measurement of biodiversity; Agriculture; Umbrella species; Biodiversity; Endangered species; Ecology; European union; Common species; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,Agriculture; Animals; Biodiversity; Birds; Conservation of Natural Resources/methods; Europe; Insecta; Plants; Spiders,,,https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/35652 http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/342561 http://core.ac.uk/display/16122783 https://eref.uni-bayreuth.de/16432/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16958888 https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00869.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00869.x,16958888,10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00869.x,2127607738,,0,001-215-876-773-222; 004-429-269-367-575; 005-235-185-219-437; 006-905-590-991-195; 008-225-619-668-580; 012-645-250-423-764; 016-421-756-148-512; 018-028-975-115-624; 019-123-430-272-496; 020-713-595-267-906; 024-462-745-358-873; 028-070-322-250-054; 029-324-991-196-140; 031-592-787-048-258; 041-704-628-510-931; 050-261-844-716-21X; 057-565-952-334-216; 058-760-424-393-175; 060-114-103-966-089; 061-825-091-176-860; 063-149-977-873-288; 070-807-130-928-517; 078-958-368-056-092; 095-014-169-963-827; 099-208-933-442-607; 102-519-835-076-978; 104-088-599-370-817; 117-193-387-947-836; 119-133-345-798-623; 124-362-582-173-520; 132-380-117-709-640; 134-073-329-038-546; 139-200-896-129-808; 142-023-278-020-69X; 144-915-982-059-308; 150-761-385-310-830; 170-044-763-432-805,837

Eight 6 m grass margins (total length 3492 m) and two control sections (no margin; total length 700 m) were monitored over the first years of the agreements using the transect method. Significantly greater total numbers of butterflies and individuals of Maniola jurtina were seen on the 6 m grass margins than on the control sections. There was a significant increase in abundance of Maniola jurtina on the margins over the 4-year study period.

Holland; Lenore Fahrig,"Abstract The relationship between density and richness of herbivorous insects in alfalfa fields, and the amount (total length) of woody field border in the landscapes surrounding the fields was studied. Insects (predominantly herbivorous) were sampled in 35 alfalfa fields in 1995 and 24 fields in 1996, and the total length of woody field borders within the 1 km radius circular landscape surrounding each field was measured. There was no effect of amount of woody border in the landscape on insect density. There was a significant positive effect of amount of woody border in the landscape on overall family richness of insects in the alfalfa fields. The results of this study suggest that woody borders increase diversity but not density of herbivorous insects within crop fields in agro-ecosystems. This suggests that woody borders play a role in maintaining biodiversity in agro-ecosystems, and that this role extends beyond the borders themselves, into the crop fields.",78,2,115,122,Biodiversity; Habitat; Ecology; PEST analysis; Insect; Herbivore; Biological dispersal; Species richness; Agroecosystem; Biology,,,,,"https://ir.library.carleton.ca/pub/1625 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20001107600 http://directory.umm.ac.id/Data%20Elmu/jurnal/A/Agriculture,%20Ecosystems%20and%20Environment/Vol78.Issue3.May2000/1522.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880999001231",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-8809(99)00123-1,,10.1016/s0167-8809(99)00123-1,2134521532,,0,006-264-678-363-030; 007-967-646-577-293; 010-888-549-334-33X; 019-657-415-295-733; 019-658-253-028-863; 023-487-127-123-633; 029-867-831-229-290; 039-420-737-419-364; 047-269-872-714-025; 055-083-398-263-398; 064-981-393-600-018; 066-473-451-770-640; 078-804-512-930-417; 084-387-070-806-39X; 093-201-713-099-739; 120-102-912-732-000; 126-185-854-218-293; 133-272-860-021-373; 144-001-154-236-099; 145-653-851-729-665; 150-608-623-042-448; 158-889-184-541-345; 159-992-062-101-765; 163-337-132-156-029; 187-050-769-304-212,131

Zaimes; Richard C. Schultz; Thomas M. Isenhart,"Row-crop agriculture, continuous-grazing, and stream channelization, have accelerated stream bank erosion and increased sediment load. Stream bank erosion rates and total soil loss were compared among riparian forest buffers, row-crop fields and continuously grazed pastures along a continuous 11 km (6.8 mi) stream reach in central Iowa. Exposed erosion pins were measured to estimate stream bank erosion rates, approximately every month from June 1998 to June 1999, except during the winter months. Total stream bank soil losses for each treatment were estimated from the mean bank erosion rate, mean bulk density, and the total stream bank eroding area. Row-crop fields had the greatest stream bank erosion rate and total soil losses followed by continuously grazed pastures while riparian forest buffers had the lowest. If riparian forest buffers had been established along all of the non-buffered segments of the 11 km (6.8 mi) stream reach, total stream bank soil loss would have been reduced by approximately 72%.",59,1,19,27,Soil conservation; Riparian zone; Erosion; Bank; Riparian forest; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; Bank erosion; Bulk density,,,,,http://www.jswconline.org/content/59/1/19.full.pdf https://www.jswconline.org/content/59/1/19 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=804628,https://www.jswconline.org/content/59/1/19,,,2271839792,,0,023-903-841-666-643; 026-062-029-714-531; 029-506-993-712-513; 032-939-494-687-618; 036-902-840-704-756; 038-439-180-047-201; 038-457-926-780-880; 040-229-676-588-390; 045-814-903-083-739; 046-578-305-405-771; 048-513-319-982-524; 057-727-962-585-077; 070-566-047-565-191; 079-421-064-953-970; 087-688-941-970-522; 088-940-485-566-099; 093-196-370-654-513; 106-420-394-515-001; 115-116-470-176-858; 118-507-802-614-015; 127-785-284-544-120; 128-195-997-346-382; 135-164-447-955-695; 156-198-700-632-804; 173-535-244-239-152; 180-524-585-737-168; 194-193-950-627-261,117
056-572-672-082-930,Multiple functions of buffer strips in farming areas,,2010,journal article,European Journal of Agronomy,11610301,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Maurizio Borin; Matteo Passoni; Mara Thiene; Tiziano Tempesta,"Buffer strips (BSs) are strips interposed between fields and streams that intercept and treat the waters leaving cropland, and so are a useful tool for reducing agricultural diffuse pollution in lowland areas. If properly vegetated and managed, they can also produce wood for burning, act as sinks for atmospheric CO2 and enhance the landscape beauty. The paper presents an analysis of the different functions of BS and reviews the more important data from research programmes conducted over the last decade in Veneto Region (North-East Italy). Over a period of 3-5 years, in two experimental sites, young BS reduced total runoff by 33%, losses of N by 44% and P by 50% compared to no-BS. A mature BS was able to abate both NO3-N and dissolved phosphorus concentrations by almost 100%, in most cases having exiting water that satisfied the limit for avoiding eutrophication. The BS also proved to be a useful barrier for herbicides, with concentrations abated by 60% and 90%, depending on the chemical and the time elapsed since application. Considering the CO2 immobilized in the wood and soil together, the different BS monitored stored up to 80 t ha−1 year−1. The BS caused negligible disturbance to maize, soybean and sugarbeet yields. The hedgerows, par- ticularly if composed of trees taller than 6 m, positively influenced the aesthetic value of the territory, improving its perceived naturalness and screening the man-made elements. Lastly, through a multi-objective analysis, opportunity costs were estimated to support the public decision-maker in determining the subsidies to be paid to encourage farmers to plant BS.",32,1,103,111,Agriculture; Eutrophication; Carbon sequestration; Buffer zone; Environmental science; STREAMS; Buffer strip; Agricultural land; Surface runoff; Agronomy,,,,,https://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND44294573 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1161030109000422 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103048902 https://core.ac.uk/display/53433287 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1161030109000422 http://swcdis.nchu.edu.tw/AllDataPos/AdvancePos/7098042027/meeting2.pdf https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103048902.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2009.05.003,,10.1016/j.eja.2009.05.003,2148736093,,0,002-619-138-977-925; 002-650-706-842-54X; 004-021-185-380-001; 005-046-617-641-306; 008-380-052-396-94X; 008-467-759-539-985; 009-621-467-902-841; 014-561-967-561-763; 017-011-845-333-503; 018-314-216-406-444; 036-456-610-975-852; 040-764-695-694-855; 041-958-306-641-576; 044-327-313-877-518; 044-401-317-828-273; 048-236-890-450-284; 052-812-920-178-486; 056-444-102-079-143; 066-008-497-105-394; 068-789-689-250-577; 075-847-940-362-322; 080-325-866-783-059; 080-894-085-139-156; 081-599-307-585-122; 082-797-391-654-568; 083-528-691-484-522; 086-496-072-727-834; 087-168-688-204-963; 088-526-158-902-16X; 091-276-989-494-901; 092-699-730-760-490; 095-869-161-076-004; 102-299-231-485-20X; 105-758-446-831-447; 106-653-949-616-859; 106-781-589-646-566; 111-288-588-656-115; 115-438-312-606-519; 123-228-703-339-483; 130-940-780-158-38X; 134-132-731-404-230; 136-078-117-326-445; 138-643-821-809-522; 139-517-091-729-860; 140-801-758-848-408; 151-498-245-092-772; 159-359-733-987-293; 162-727-536-926-648; 175-634-282-487-970; 178-140-173-536-98X; 182-906-730-748-020; 186-058-267-312-271; 191-147-319-900-194; 198-427-699-712-670,113

Sparks; Richard F. Pywell; Heather Pickett; Marek Nowakowski,"Abstract A replicated field experiment designed to compare five types of field margin in terms of their invertebrate biodiversity was established in North Yorkshire, UK. Four replicate margins on arable land each contained five treatment plots 72 m long by 6 m wide. The treatments were: (1) cropped to the edge; (2) sown ‘tussocky’ grass mix; (3) sown ‘grass and wildflower’ mix; (4) Split margin (3 m ‘tussocky’ grass adjacent to hedge and 3 m ‘grass and wildflower’ next to crop); and (5) natural regeneration. Invertebrates were sampled by pitfall trapping, sweep netting, and butterfly and bumblebee transects, and identified to species level. The use of different flower species by foraging bumblebees was also examined. Despite all treatments containing a flush of annual weeds early in the establishment year, the five margin types were distinct in their vegetation composition by their first mid-summer. Where statistically significant results were obtained for invertebrates, avoidance of the ‘cropped’ treatment was by far the commonest observed response. This tendency could be clearly demonstrated amongst the carabids, spiders, butterflies, bumblebees, millipedes and harvestmen, with margins often containing double or more the number of invertebrates of similar areas cropped to the edge. Having avoided the crop, preferences for other margin types were mixed, but there was a marked tendency by many nectar and/or pollen-feeding, flying insects towards greater abundance on those margins containing sown ‘wildflowers’ (e.g. butterflies Meadow Brown and Ringlet, Bumblebees, Pollen Beetle Meligethes sp.) or flowers either sown or unsown (Soldier Beetle Rhagonycha fulva ). There was a less strong tendency for predatory species occurring in the vegetation canopy and depending on small, especially flying insects for food, to also prefer the flowery treatments (e.g. total spiders caught by sweeping, seven-spot ladybird). Harvestmen in autumn reject natural regeneration in favour of any sown treatment. Only one species, the carabid Nebria brevicollis , was trapped in higher numbers in the cropped treatment than on any sown margin, and then only in autumn. Of the six common bumblebee species, the two longest-tongued species showed different patterns of flower visitation from the remaining four. These results clearly demonstrate that sown field margins can rapidly produce substantial biodiversity benefits on arable land, with the resulting fauna influenced by the type of field margin created.",106,2,259,271,Fauna; Biodiversity; Nectar; Ecology; Bumblebee; Wildflower; Nebria brevicollis; Soldier beetle; Species diversity; Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000632070100252X http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632070100252X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0006-3207(01)00252-x,,10.1016/s0006-3207(01)00252-x,2037879773,,0,007-827-850-871-938; 014-809-297-009-430; 015-522-490-223-197; 020-713-595-267-906; 030-652-847-337-20X; 044-050-646-677-718; 056-892-041-411-85X; 058-105-561-757-413; 061-255-779-212-020; 077-623-747-437-53X; 078-068-143-214-104; 079-068-774-342-74X; 080-139-567-968-521; 087-186-786-234-321; 088-089-591-331-916; 104-824-287-195-100; 105-466-690-006-049; 111-564-806-763-612; 131-508-903-583-735; 142-547-556-180-595; 155-264-691-522-430; 170-044-763-432-805; 171-352-683-438-394,231

Species of particular conservation interest that could benefit from connecting habitats especially in agroecosystems are native forest herbs. It is still unclear, however, which hedgerow habitats have the best potential of supporting diverse forest herb communities, making it hard to target particular structures for conservation. Our objective was to identify the local and landscape characteristics of hedgerows that could help predict their potential at maximizing the richness, abundance, and diversity of native forest herbs of temperate deciduous forests of North-East America. We used multiple regression, Moran’I correlograms, and conditional autoregressive models to assess the effect of landscape and historical variables (hedgerow age, amount of adjacent forest cover, connection to forests and other hedgerows) and of local variables (hedgerow width, canopy cover, cover of other species) on the response variables. The results show an increase in forest herb diversity and abundance in hedgerows with time and with increasing nearby forest cover. Local factors such as greater width and reduced cover of other species also relate to a greater abundance and diversity of forest herbs in linear habitats. The fact that forest herb communities can reassemble in hedgerow corridors with time implies that there could be long-term benefits in maintaining and even creating linear habitats where there is a pool of dispersing forest herbs.",141,1,298,307,Canopy; Old-growth forest; Biodiversity; Temperate deciduous forest; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Species richness; Agroforestry; Agroecosystem; Abundance (ecology),,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320707004090 https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND44019832,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2007.10.003,,10.1016/j.biocon.2007.10.003,2158924568,,0,004-931-123-113-576; 007-221-361-423-978; 007-361-282-044-640; 007-571-395-247-941; 010-949-194-518-91X; 011-185-071-186-782; 011-817-622-257-771; 013-210-533-072-945; 018-300-493-662-705; 018-359-440-164-725; 018-463-393-074-304; 022-253-628-718-442; 026-450-244-324-768; 026-926-325-058-247; 028-260-567-737-933; 031-712-522-366-166; 032-328-441-523-30X; 037-979-273-547-994; 038-822-325-960-838; 040-058-016-041-863; 042-525-991-664-938; 043-510-003-480-725; 045-646-010-060-089; 046-117-480-681-720; 046-595-945-408-676; 046-662-847-447-759; 047-130-476-878-70X; 051-075-307-068-357; 051-197-969-663-775; 054-328-419-977-493; 055-551-318-921-640; 063-207-503-700-767; 065-172-604-775-608; 069-384-032-928-970; 071-601-864-758-089; 073-668-140-241-403; 073-798-803-161-275; 074-151-454-931-065; 075-182-328-430-399; 079-916-118-520-017; 083-199-823-871-264; 086-380-640-184-897; 094-234-240-781-128; 095-350-099-081-855; 096-074-282-606-638; 096-835-160-953-686; 097-076-798-843-218; 098-520-454-909-513; 098-889-499-768-531; 100-565-254-478-439; 108-184-742-497-745; 108-586-996-670-001; 123-117-631-521-216; 125-703-290-888-953; 128-463-822-517-061; 131-556-321-215-613; 136-453-842-687-376; 139-621-249-823-41X; 148-422-686-545-715; 149-673-684-724-149; 160-779-095-696-518; 166-153-854-096-315; 172-560-580-560-47X; 174-103-363-317-763; 180-721-397-650-279; 182-505-603-837-437,55

Yahner,"Use of 3 vertical strata and 13 genera of trees and shrubs by 28 bird species was examined during a 2-year study of 7 farmstead shelterbelts in Dakota County, Minnesota. Similar use of strata occasionally occurred between bird species, but similarities in use of plantings were not found. The majority (60.7%) of the bird species was most often sighted in the ground stratum. Genera of plantings preferred by the avian community included Picea, Populus, Acer, Lonicera, and Ulmus. Bird species best adapted to shelterbelts appeared to be generalists in strata and planting use. Inclusion of the 5 preferred genera of trees and shrubs in new shelterbelts or in old shelterbelts in need of renovation would benefit a variety of bird species in intensively farmed regions. This management practice would increase vegetative complexity in a vertical dimension, enabling coexisting bird species to partition space more effectively in these spatially restricted habitats. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 46(1):50-60 Farmstead shelterbelts are planted primarily to provide year-round protection to humans, domestic animals, homes, and buildings from the effects of high winds, windchills, and snowdrifts, thereby reducing costs of fuel, feed, maintenance, and labor associated with farm operations (Smith and Scholten 1980). These manmade habitats are also important to many bird species that depend on woody habitats as sources of food and cover in intensively farmed regions (Orendurff 1941, Martin 1978). As a consequence of larger farms, increased mechanization, planting of extensive fields in fewer types of crops (principally corn and soybeans), and other recent agricultural trends, farmstead shelterbelts and other wooded habitats often comprise only 3% or less of the total area (Griffith 1976). Moreover, farmstead shelterbelts are generally less than 1 ha in size, and vegetative composition may vary considerably among shelterbelts because landowners can select from a variety of d ciduous and coniferous trees and shrubs when planting new or renovating existing shelterbelts (Smith and Scholten 1980). Thus, an understanding of the m nner by which avian species exploit space in these spatially restricted, manmade habitats is essential for the proper management of birds in the Great Plains",46,1,50,,Agriculture; Windbreak; Sowing; Habitat; Geography; Generalist and specialist species; Agroforestry,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/3808407,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3808407,,10.2307/3808407,2329100246,,0,014-018-662-807-908; 027-720-238-457-429; 047-000-620-546-182; 052-393-742-123-787; 081-738-410-243-355; 103-676-509-390-115; 110-206-492-515-547; 138-864-654-742-242; 156-463-496-242-968; 169-398-551-622-968; 187-347-218-584-905; 198-769-003-660-084,38

Weigel; John Lyons; Laura K. Paine; Stanley I. Dodson; Daniel J. Undersander,"Abstract Vegetative riparian buffer strips are typically used to curb stream degradation due to cattle grazing, but intensive rotational grazing has shown promise as an alternative best management practice. We compared aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages among stream segments within continuously grazed pastures, intensive rotationally grazed pastures, undisturbed grassy vegetative buffer strips, and undisturbed woody vegetative buffer strips. We collected macroinvertebrate and stream sedimentation data from four streams in each land use category in two consecutive years. In an attempt to account for inherent watershed variability among streams, we represented watershed condition with a sample collected upstream of each treatment reach.

The main aims of this study were (i) to investigate how four hedge stand types, i.e., systems of management distinguished on the basis of the natural and managed growth forms of trees and shrubs (low single-storied, high single-storied, two-storied and multi-storied), differ in their biometric parameters and (ii) to identify the primary management-related determinants of native woody species richness. The study used a large dataset of hedgerows (n=538) sampled in seven sites in Northern Italy. The four hedge stand types exhibited highly significant differences in size and biometric parameters. The multi-storied hedges, associated with the highest stand structural diversity index values, supported the highest number of tree species, followed by high single-storied hedges. The low single-storied hedge stand type contained the lowest number of species. We found a positive effect of hedge area as well as a marginal negative effect of basal area on native woody species richness. The management implications addressed by our study include conversion of single-storied into two- or multi-storied types, increasing hedge size and controlling hedge stand basal area.",6,4,201,208,Agriculture; Hedge (finance); Biodiversity; Dead hedge; Field (geography); Global biodiversity; Ecology; Geography; Species richness; Basal area,,,,,https://iforest.sisef.org/contents/?id=ifor0749-006 https://iforest.sisef.org/pdf/?id=ifor0749-006 http://www.sisef.it/iforest/contents/?id=ifor0749-006 http://www.sisef.it/iforest/pdf/?id=ifor0749-006 https://core.ac.uk/display/53497125 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cattaneo_Dina/publication/237008587_Assessment_of_hedge_stand_types_as_determinants_of_woody_species_richness_in_rural_field_margins/links/0c96051ae09b7d3a35000000.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3832/ifor0749-006,,10.3832/ifor0749-006,2035578995,,0,000-329-241-681-366; 002-234-862-186-238; 007-513-938-529-086; 008-532-010-264-113; 011-175-232-330-433; 011-749-588-004-356; 011-813-364-108-969; 016-915-486-723-598; 016-944-193-681-825; 018-023-127-841-209; 020-670-103-284-949; 023-360-149-157-668; 023-935-502-746-047; 030-490-805-553-423; 031-335-116-917-830; 033-007-577-863-88X; 034-366-554-328-48X; 038-361-105-216-688; 039-524-631-746-697; 043-315-725-758-49X; 045-445-063-674-649; 047-130-476-878-70X; 047-949-455-932-004; 048-704-737-253-297; 050-221-705-163-68X; 050-532-464-266-167; 052-951-584-268-481; 053-364-624-635-937; 056-853-001-254-085; 057-122-180-983-992; 060-009-962-481-27X; 062-441-837-157-062; 068-452-604-669-157; 070-997-856-493-073; 071-601-656-233-384; 072-224-176-896-782; 073-798-803-161-275; 084-896-198-252-512; 086-026-725-403-460; 086-377-939-570-007; 088-934-637-295-013; 089-185-474-387-677; 089-601-345-641-026; 096-253-286-951-280; 101-150-316-380-050; 115-742-892-181-305; 118-027-534-280-035; 123-524-226-005-021; 134-362-031-188-18X; 144-650-014-019-56X; 154-750-119-428-838; 156-624-196-949-616; 161-425-757-559-60X; 183-783-359-943-428; 187-050-769-304-212; 195-877-107-571-018; 196-902-964-847-590,14

Among the specific objectives of the project, there was the determination of change in the composition of the microbial populations of soil of the wooded riparian strip. The composition of the bacterial communities collected at different depths inside and outside the riparian strip was determined by combined approaches involving cultivation (CFU), microscopic approaches (CTC test), and DNA-based techniques (ARDRA and DGGE). The size of the living population was the same inside and outside the experimental strip, with a minor percentage of culturable bacteria. Higher numbers of metabolically active bacteria and higher bacterial diversity were detected in the internal soil, with deeper soil layers showing reduced diversity, thus indicating that soil management within the riparian strip effectively supports the viability of bacterial communities. Total operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and percentage of single OTUs were also found to be always higher in the internal soil samples for all soil layers, with the percentage of Firmicutes increasing and Actinobacteria decreasing with depth. The increasing soil organic carbon inputs due to the contribution of the growing plants were found to support bacterial diversity in all soil layers. DNA-based analysis also indicated a clear effect of the applied treatments on soil bacterial diversity and a well-defined separation of the bacterial communities related to the different soil layers of the riparian strip.",50,1,25,35,Riparian zone; Nutrient; Soil horizon; Ecology; Actinobacteria; Population; Environmental science; Soil carbon; Soil test; Soil management,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00374-013-0828-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-013-0828-0,,10.1007/s00374-013-0828-0,2079734665,,0,002-544-141-739-836; 003-146-568-976-286; 007-264-849-633-936; 007-815-182-529-644; 008-300-949-027-855; 015-385-795-850-37X; 015-514-563-181-208; 016-539-892-743-141; 019-171-695-684-492; 019-408-938-369-167; 020-977-235-603-557; 021-580-009-454-283; 026-041-317-347-964; 026-317-942-977-966; 027-710-101-819-792; 027-790-176-075-794; 033-288-326-981-789; 045-361-706-293-13X; 045-875-483-919-702; 046-134-576-734-895; 047-054-459-650-699; 047-857-691-947-082; 048-499-020-639-774; 049-552-830-805-099; 056-408-790-277-179; 058-305-580-152-790; 058-853-573-025-491; 060-206-701-399-748; 065-379-680-848-256; 068-991-112-456-561; 069-074-493-034-28X; 070-182-672-006-341; 072-931-515-353-890; 078-477-965-091-93X; 083-551-558-405-464; 084-040-930-198-230; 090-711-571-439-38X; 093-017-744-775-904; 093-184-946-875-581; 093-705-810-558-203; 103-815-161-344-691; 111-685-276-532-817; 115-018-459-514-474; 118-042-835-886-984; 122-075-844-248-680; 149-768-444-296-351; 150-539-908-471-485; 168-817-996-521-550; 169-607-559-923-667; 177-223-877-096-350,13

This was undertaken in 24 wheat fields in 'coarse-grain' and 'fine- grain' landscapes in western France. A greater percentage of the latter landscape was covered by hedgerows and grassland and the total area covered by fields and the average size of the fields were smaller. 2 The effects on aphid abundance of the distance from field margins, the presence of grassy strips and carabid abundance were determined in both landscapes. 3 Both aphid species were more abundant in the 'fine-grain' landscape, which may have been a result of the higher density of semi-natural elements. In both types of landscape, the total numbers of aphids were negatively correlated with the distance from the field margin. This may have been because aphids were dispersing from overwintering sites in field margins. The abundance of M. dirhodum was strongly negatively correlated with the presence of grassy strips in the 'coarse- grain' landscape, although there were no such significant correlations for either of the aphid species in the 'fine-grain' landscape. 4 Aphid and carabid abundances were negatively correlated in the 'fine-grain' and positively in 'coarse-grain' landscape. 5 The results obtained in the present study emphasize the importance of semi-natural areas in agricultural landscapes in shaping the spatial distribution of aphids and carabid beetles, their natural enemies, at different spatial scales.",15,1,24,33,Biological pest control; Predation; Ecology; Grassland; Overwintering; Aphid; Spatial distribution; Sitobion avenae; Agronomy; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00812051 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-9563.2012.00587.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-9563.2012.00587.x,,10.1111/j.1461-9563.2012.00587.x,2050720902,,0,000-484-826-607-866; 003-942-438-230-467; 004-281-677-682-461; 004-335-231-279-062; 004-370-090-982-806; 004-480-561-456-755; 004-725-168-123-949; 005-994-391-149-799; 007-159-731-641-426; 008-301-310-295-925; 009-664-521-659-134; 010-888-549-334-33X; 010-945-646-716-071; 011-508-246-956-659; 012-241-644-554-168; 012-678-572-116-901; 013-526-378-431-354; 014-157-715-145-910; 014-420-425-932-76X; 014-564-265-469-130; 014-959-014-923-892; 015-796-697-992-282; 016-417-813-667-465; 021-921-934-143-717; 021-984-605-666-11X; 022-549-457-076-862; 023-888-062-670-958; 024-945-527-781-020; 025-307-718-158-485; 025-840-639-555-912; 028-267-755-864-042; 028-917-029-117-685; 032-043-084-866-144; 035-947-335-206-732; 038-442-778-043-35X; 039-283-365-632-704; 043-374-493-441-759; 050-980-481-048-144; 051-197-969-663-775; 051-728-484-218-665; 053-505-331-627-489; 053-830-117-088-153; 054-715-078-148-813; 056-789-845-462-569; 056-822-231-800-190; 058-047-121-637-992; 058-105-561-757-413; 058-568-064-917-114; 064-338-086-975-394; 064-893-774-544-494; 066-033-171-769-128; 066-347-110-782-638; 069-338-916-193-060; 069-379-822-515-162; 077-001-732-149-061; 077-277-772-557-227; 078-258-635-923-748; 078-792-911-376-219; 079-535-731-889-251; 079-653-087-424-02X; 083-735-425-371-439; 083-874-461-551-20X; 086-624-270-213-651; 089-253-154-997-777; 089-824-296-465-609; 093-612-417-630-86X; 101-595-381-677-645; 109-332-821-353-318; 109-691-661-850-685; 111-528-391-156-029; 113-790-282-907-897; 115-689-036-190-663; 117-345-687-903-78X; 119-352-383-206-342; 124-788-315-762-978; 125-357-678-676-499; 126-184-551-619-095; 131-261-344-144-063; 134-910-223-418-626; 137-942-105-992-390; 138-273-128-181-890; 142-547-556-180-595; 142-638-428-622-145; 144-295-536-484-748; 144-700-882-404-647; 148-789-623-443-683; 150-325-162-873-23X; 152-174-341-381-190; 155-691-175-864-748; 156-624-196-949-616; 158-498-105-839-226; 160-340-034-725-29X; 174-103-363-317-763; 175-135-717-976-663; 175-463-126-698-414; 189-086-207-766-711; 192-182-455-331-555; 195-618-519-387-640,27

Parkinson; Georgianne J. K. Griffiths; A. Fernandez Garcia; E. J. P. Marshall,"Summary; ; ; 1;  Understanding the spatial dynamics of insect distributions in farmland can provide insights into their ecological requirements and potential for management. Identifying the scale, location and persistence of species’ aggregations is an important step towards understanding the factors driving population distributions. This study examined how different carabid species were distributed in field and field margin habitats, and analysed their spatiotemporal dynamics.; ; 2;  We sampled 156 locations in a grid of pitfall traps over approximately 1 ha, comprising a hedgerow and adjacent parts of two arable fields. Traps were monitored between June and November 1994 to provide data with high spatial and temporal resolution of the two-dimensional distributions of six carabid beetle taxa.; ; 3;  The pattern of carabid activity-density over the experimental site was displayed in a series of contour plots. Spatial analyses by distance indices (SADIE) were used to provide aggregation indices (Ia) for the distributions of carabid species at different times.; ; 4; A second SADIE index (Im) of spatial association between two sets of counts was used to measure the spatial stability of species’ aggregation patterns through time. Im was also used to measure association or dissociation between the distributions of different species, and the spatial association between a species’ distribution and an environmental variable.; ; 5;  Each taxon was aggregated most of the time, but different taxa aggregated in patches within the field and/or hedgerow to different and varying extents. The field boundaries were important for some species, either as the only habitat in which they occurred (Amara spp.), as the major focus of more widespread distribution (Harpalus rufipes), or as a seasonal refuge (Nebria brevicollis). Within the crop habitat, different species also occupied different areas, providing some evidence to suggest species packing in space.; ; 6;  Spatial distributions between consecutive samples were strongly and positively associated, indicating stability of patch location over short time-scales. The strength of the association in turn was correlated with activity-density. When time lags were introduced between sample distributions, some negative association indices indicated displacement of patches. In most cases, however, positive association was maintained over long periods, demonstrating patch stability.; ; 7;  The spatial stability of patches suggests that future studies should focus on the detailed measurement of biotic and abiotic factors associated with patch location. Identifying the underlying causes of population distributions in farmland has important implications for managing habitat to enhance populations of beneficial predators, and targeting insecticide applications in precision agriculture to minimize their adverse side-effects.",38,1,100,116,Abiotic component; Field (geography); Habitat; Ecology; Harpalus rufipes; Spatial distribution; Nebria brevicollis; Stability (probability); Taxon; Biology,,,,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00574.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00574.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00574.x/full https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND604258032,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00574.x,,10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00574.x,2080568963,,0,002-840-565-989-288; 005-477-965-388-217; 009-120-913-363-96X; 010-888-549-334-33X; 013-963-655-119-437; 014-571-735-949-397; 014-809-297-009-430; 014-945-646-073-964; 015-745-674-744-948; 020-831-252-589-740; 021-461-514-781-574; 021-462-701-059-231; 036-171-649-939-905; 037-241-390-682-529; 037-731-106-378-493; 041-946-823-120-543; 042-287-420-054-457; 043-329-639-022-790; 044-050-646-677-718; 046-117-070-832-020; 047-474-865-839-244; 047-591-108-263-658; 054-095-333-888-006; 056-892-041-411-85X; 058-098-786-154-557; 063-289-521-238-627; 069-622-233-079-646; 073-332-568-126-247; 080-139-567-968-521; 083-113-612-315-815; 092-387-691-527-318; 099-176-314-169-767; 103-574-740-960-136; 109-335-442-828-436; 109-407-548-674-770; 110-684-291-574-379; 118-423-406-852-101; 120-514-812-606-235; 122-593-714-312-795; 128-918-101-050-930; 133-540-484-254-808; 135-300-924-298-24X; 142-906-704-148-354; 157-255-319-968-581; 186-464-257-554-721; 194-482-255-430-935; 194-859-575-207-30X,197

F. Novikova; M. V. Konyushkova,"The results of soil studies performed in 2005–2009 at the first experimental plot of the Arshan’-Zelmen Research Station of the Institute of Forest Science of the Russian Academy of Sciences are discussed. The post-reclamation state (about 55 years after reclamation) of the soils under forest shelterbelts and adjacent croplands in the rainfed agriculture was studied. The long-term efficiency of forest reclamation and crop-growing technologies developed in the 1950s by the Dokuchaev Soil Science Institute and the Institute of Forest to reclaim strongly saline solonetzic soils was proved. In 55 years, strongly saline sodic solonetzes with sulfate-chloride and chloride-sulfate composition of salts were replaced by agrogenic soils with new properties. Under forest shelterbelts, where deep (40–60 cm) plowing was performed, the soils were transformed into slightly saline solonetzic agrozems with slight soda salinization in the upper meter and with dealkalized plowed and turbated horizons (0–20(40) cm). Under the adjacent cropland subjected to the influence of the shelterbelts on the soil water regime, strongly saline solonetzes were transformed into solonchakous agrosolonetzes with slight soda salinization in the upper 50 cm. In the plow layer, the content of exchangeable sodium decreased to 4–12% of the sum of exchangeable cations. An increased alkalinity and the presence of soda were found in the middle-profile horizons of the anthropogenically transformed soils.",46,3,241,253,Windbreak; Soil salinity; Soil water; Plough; Rainfed agriculture; Exchangeable sodium; Hydrology; Environmental science; Alkalinity; Land reclamation,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013EurSS..46..241N/abstract https://rd.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1134%2FS106422931303006X.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134%2FS106422931303006X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/s106422931303006x,,10.1134/s106422931303006x,2073673151,,0,015-138-439-777-948; 037-905-467-479-545; 044-298-203-870-34X; 058-991-206-816-318; 080-150-803-686-065; 157-048-676-613-04X,6

Some margins were widened and vegetation was established by sowing of leguminous plants or was allowed to invade spontaneously. The communities of pollinating insects in reclaimed field margins were compared with those of a margin with a naturally diverse flora and an adjacent pasture. A beehive was placed in the area and the collection of pollen by the honey-bees was followed over the season in order to compare the bees' preferences with the supply of flowering plants available in the different experimental field margins. The sown leguminous plants were very attractive to most insect groups, especially bees and bumble-bees, and their pollen constituted an important part of the bees' total catch. The vegetation established by spontaneous succession especially attracted Syrphidae and other groups of Diptera. Butterflies were found in all vegetation types. It is concluded that small areas with flowering plants can give highly positive effects. The key question is how to avoid weed problems and keep the most attractive plant species with a minimum of cost and effort.",40,1-4,117,124,Ecological succession; Flora; Pollination; Vegetation; Habitat; Ecology; Weed; Beehive; Pollen; Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016788099290087R,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0167-8809(92)90087-r,,10.1016/0167-8809(92)90087-r,2051341738,,0,027-405-522-971-388; 039-885-186-600-094,101

We compared species richness and densities of breeding songbirds among 3 narrow (55–95 m) and 3 wide (400–530 m) forested-riparian areas with adjacent grassland-shrub buffer strips and 3 narrow and 3 wide forested-riparian areas without adjacent grassland-shrub buffer strips, in northeastern Missouri, USA. More bird species occurred in wide than in narrow forested-riparian areas (mean difference = 8.58, 95% CI = 4.82–12.35). Wide forested-riparian areas with and without adjacent buffer strips had similar numbers of species (mean difference = 0.50, 95% CI = −2.77–3.77). Narrow forested-riparian areas with adjacent buffer strips had more species than narrow forested-riparian areas without adjacent buffer strips (mean difference = 9.67, 95% CI = 5.43–13.90).

Seventy field margins in the diverse farmland of SW Poland were investigated with regard to their vascular plants, bryophytes and breeding birds. We checked the occurrence of threatened and conservation concern species, i.e. those listed in local, national or European threatened species lists, and birds with an unfavorable conservation status in Europe. Of a total of 673 species, 18 classified as threatened were recorded: 12 vascular plants (2.2 % of the total number of species), five bryophytes (5.6 %), and one bird species (2.0 %). Threatened plants occurred in 18.6 % of study plots, bryophytes in 20.0 % and birds in 12.9 %. Eleven bird species, noted in 95.7 % of study plots, had an unfavorable conservation status in Europe. Increasing volumes of trees and shrubs significantly increased the overall richness in each taxa. In percentage terms the occurrence of focal species in all three taxa tended to be higher in shrubby than in herbaceous and tree-lined margins. Our data demonstrate that field margins in Central European arable farmland regularly support rare and threatened species, and therefore deserve greater conservation efforts. Red lists along with alternative listing approaches can be employed to evaluate the biodiversity of fine-scale habitats, but their applicability depends on the taxonomic group and geographical scale of the lists, reflecting different conservation priorities.",23,4,999,1017,Endangered species; Ecology; Threatened species; Conservation status; Near-threatened species; Least concern; IUCN Red List; Conservation-dependent species; Species richness; Biology,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-014-0649-y https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-014-0649-y https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10531-014-0649-y.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/81872816 https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND500737080,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-014-0649-y,,10.1007/s10531-014-0649-y,1989745199,,0,000-290-918-540-296; 001-622-064-959-791; 002-747-800-031-656; 006-968-424-079-019; 008-601-953-680-960; 009-158-373-166-597; 013-241-428-536-287; 013-660-687-814-516; 014-083-314-018-428; 015-107-071-332-614; 015-276-662-838-876; 017-991-432-760-300; 018-165-719-191-792; 018-174-155-596-966; 018-575-033-223-069; 018-741-802-951-011; 020-681-006-847-192; 020-715-514-086-978; 024-390-339-110-039; 024-999-436-382-212; 025-089-378-801-856; 027-800-687-576-773; 027-874-742-816-939; 028-693-382-437-241; 029-130-193-552-117; 031-010-458-695-38X; 033-122-299-695-815; 036-052-007-208-842; 039-279-214-855-386; 046-514-794-567-495; 046-565-588-546-36X; 047-700-552-020-484; 053-290-806-818-276; 054-030-927-269-651; 055-839-208-665-650; 056-099-523-856-735; 057-952-508-478-862; 060-190-757-297-843; 065-053-286-537-935; 065-071-886-701-523; 067-070-378-841-691; 068-864-424-413-673; 072-581-816-671-721; 073-170-131-117-322; 073-798-803-161-275; 074-225-773-604-407; 075-079-722-809-588; 076-278-055-254-459; 076-992-646-369-715; 078-299-936-947-285; 080-618-639-966-540; 088-630-759-893-06X; 090-654-642-355-610; 094-671-200-085-879; 104-373-283-039-75X; 104-810-886-064-658; 116-075-591-244-229; 121-567-684-957-801; 124-803-241-350-796; 126-789-023-163-372; 129-692-017-031-224; 130-466-224-610-739; 142-690-041-023-63X; 146-139-013-657-783; 151-297-685-517-366; 165-627-368-251-055; 166-380-361-922-295; 171-738-087-214-88X; 172-510-550-222-239; 176-800-531-099-352; 183-788-989-286-517; 184-007-638-596-136; 198-344-906-090-592,28

To advise developers, we studied farming landscapes and compared bat activity at impacted sites (crops with wind turbines), sites without compensation measures (crops) and a set of sites with potential compensation measures: fallows, hedgerows, bushes, grass strips, and grass strips with bushes. Each site type was sampled twice in 2013, once during the reproductive period and once during the migratory period. Each sample consisted of at least eight nights of ultra-sound recordings. Bat species were separated into three groups: Pipistrellus sp., Eptesicus-Nyctalus sp. and Plecotus-Myotis sp. The results demonstrated that the three groups responded differently to the different potential compensation measures and that responses were season-dependent.

Bu; J.H. Xue; C.X. Zhao; Yan Wu; F.Y. Han; L. Zhu,"Loss of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from agricultural runoff is a leading cause of eutrophication in Taihu Lake, China. Riparian buffer strips can effectively remove sediment and nutrients from surface runoff. A field-scale study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the integrated poplar (Populus)-grass buffer strips with different tree planting density in reducing sediment, N, and P from agricultural runoff during natural rainfall events in Taihu Lake watershed, eastern China. The experimental site consisted of four treatments, including a control plot with no buffer strip (T0) and three poplar-grass buffer strips with different planting densities of 1,346 trees ha−1 (T1), 769 trees ha−1 (T2), and 577 trees ha−1 (T3) with planting spacing of 2 × 5 m (6.5 × 16.4 ft), 4 × 5 m (13.1 × 16.4 ft), and 6 × 5 m (19.7 × 16.4 ft), respectively. The integrated poplar-grass buffer strips significantly reduced runoff volume, sediment, total N, and total P masses by 49.3% to 61.6%, 78.7% to 90.2%, 57.2% to 71.5%, and 65.4% to 81.4%, respectively. With increasing poplar planting density in buffer strips, the canopy interception and maximum water storage capacity of litter layer increased, while the loss of sediments and nutrients from runoff decreased. There was significantly higher removal efficiency in buffer T1 than that in buffers T2 and T3 for sediment, particle-bound N (PN), and particle-bound P (PP). There was no significant difference in removal efficiency for ammonium as N (NH4-N), nitrate as N (NO3-N), and phosphate P (PO4-P) between buffers T1 and T2. According to different rainfall regimes, we found that the reduction in runoff volume, sediment, and nutrients load for buffers were higher under mild-long duration events (rainfall intensity class 2 to 4 mm h−1 [0.078 to 0.15 in hr−1]) and lower under intense-short duration events (rainfall intensity class 6 to 8 mm h−1 [0.23 to 0.31 in hr−1]). The removal efficiency of the buffers was negatively correlated with both precipitation and rainfall intensity, and the rainfall intensity had more effect on the removal efficiency than the precipitation. The results indicated that the impact of tree planting density on the effectiveness of buffer strips depended on the measured parameter. That is, the impact on sediment, PN, and PP was greater than that on the soluble N and P. The effect of tree planting density on the performance of buffer strips is mainly due to the interception of canopy and litter layer.",71,2,129,136,Riparian zone; Eutrophication; Canopy interception; Riparian buffer; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Interception,,,,,https://www.jswconline.org/content/71/2/129 https://www.jswconline.org/content/71/2/129.refs,http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.71.2.129,,10.2489/jswc.71.2.129,2307069623,,0,008-380-052-396-94X; 010-151-054-506-703; 013-102-351-520-868; 013-487-233-481-079; 025-960-744-067-693; 028-802-252-344-012; 030-682-084-703-597; 036-060-922-824-075; 037-204-088-505-975; 044-982-906-041-039; 045-878-014-461-966; 054-943-080-161-413; 064-675-123-853-466; 070-129-859-863-682; 074-251-282-539-46X; 075-834-457-354-928; 076-574-109-431-630; 082-797-391-654-568; 087-333-571-914-458; 099-719-046-892-307; 105-984-333-519-882; 111-288-588-656-115; 115-642-860-718-878; 116-445-845-636-106; 117-095-370-385-460; 151-627-024-143-052; 164-037-026-126-506; 167-265-236-780-171; 178-790-415-022-573; 181-090-792-931-175,4

Wortmann; Thomas G. Franti; Charles A. Shapiro; Dean E. Eisenhauer,"Surface water contamination can often be reduced by passing runoff water through perennial grass filters. Research was conducted in 2006 to 2008 to evaluate the size of cool season grass filters consisting primarily of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb) with some orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata L.) relative to drainage area size in reducing runoff sediment and phosphorus (P). The soil was Pohocco silt loam Typic Eutro- chrepts with a median slope of 5.5 %. The grass filters occupying 1.1 and 4.3 % of the plot area were compared with no filter with four replica- tions. The filters were planted in the V-shaped plot outlets which were 3.7×11.0 m in size. The filter effect on sediment and P concentration was deter- mined from four natural runoff events when nearly all plots had runoff. Filter effect on runoff volume and contaminant load was determined using total runoff and composites of samples collected from 12 runoff events. Sediment concentration was re- duced by 25 %w ith filters compared with no filter (from 1.10 to 1.47 gL −1 ), but P concentration was not affected. The 1.1 and 4.3 % filters, respective- ly, compared with having no grass filter, reduced: runoff volume by 54 and 79 %; sediment load by 67 and 84 % (357 to 58 kgha −1 ); total P load by 68 and 76 %( 0.58 to 0.14 kgha −1 ); particulate P (PP) load by 66 and 82 %( 0.39 to 0.07 kgha −1 ); and dissolved reactive P (DRP) load by 73 and 66 % (0.2 to 0.07 kgha −1 ), respectfully. A snowmelt runoff event had 56 % greater DRP concentration compared with rainfall-induced runoff events. Grass filters re- duced sediment and P load largely by reducing runoff volume rather than reducing concentration.

Sánchez; Luis Lassaletta; Duncan McCollin; Robert G. H. Bunce,"In Central Spain hedgerows are an important component of the landscape although many have been lost due to landscape planning and reallotment programmes. Loss of hedgerows can produce changes in environmental conditions that can be especially critical in summer, corresponding with the dry period in Mediterranean ecosystems. In order to show the effects of hedgerow removal on summer Mediterranean environmental conditions in rural landscapes, this paper describes a comparison of some key environmental conditions between areas where hedgerows are still present, compared to areas where they have been removed. Through a two-way ANOVA, it was found that temperatures in the hedgerows were significantly different from those in the fields, whilst air temperatures beneath the hedgerows were lower, and steadier, than those of surrounding areas. When temperatures of the fields were compared to those sites where hedgerows had been removed, significant differences in temperatures were detected belowground and sometimes at soil surface level but not at higher levels. The levels of soil water content and organic carbon were higher where hedgerows were still in place. These differences indicate potentially negative environmental impacts due to hedgerow removal. The implications of hedgerow conservation for environmental protection and for cropland productivity are discussed.",78,1,13,25,Productivity (ecology); Soil water; Soil organic matter; Hedgerow removal; Microclimate; Ecological stability; Environmental science; Soil carbon; Mediterranean climate; Agroforestry,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103046531 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-009-9224-z https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10457-009-9224-z https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-009-9224-z/fulltext.html http://nectar.northampton.ac.uk/3010/ https://pure.northampton.ac.uk/en/publications/the-effect-of-hedgerow-loss-on-microclimate-in-the-mediterranean-,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-009-9224-z,,10.1007/s10457-009-9224-z,2098992937,,0,000-859-859-510-858; 004-259-813-635-301; 006-014-553-266-593; 007-513-938-529-086; 009-104-527-591-059; 011-055-691-850-597; 013-537-827-071-969; 015-606-762-402-796; 019-945-094-134-221; 021-951-510-082-145; 022-427-169-113-379; 024-369-018-626-02X; 024-766-267-051-035; 025-296-906-047-191; 026-138-277-832-99X; 027-554-288-342-119; 027-794-497-211-644; 028-917-029-117-685; 029-878-765-640-703; 029-904-475-177-008; 033-940-461-895-730; 038-487-202-161-432; 039-524-631-746-697; 041-013-862-299-246; 041-864-362-916-311; 045-756-108-073-74X; 048-223-385-236-735; 048-711-037-068-782; 049-540-456-352-692; 052-951-584-268-481; 052-953-850-403-789; 053-137-818-248-134; 054-715-078-148-813; 059-822-271-118-371; 060-397-400-821-890; 060-459-523-160-798; 061-312-895-242-620; 061-659-654-152-299; 062-441-837-157-062; 065-985-181-262-074; 066-302-610-938-45X; 066-761-779-416-465; 068-143-605-669-192; 071-601-864-758-089; 075-426-772-342-06X; 075-526-471-654-826; 077-277-772-557-227; 078-938-204-949-144; 087-814-527-586-749; 088-470-568-990-908; 088-914-677-431-296; 093-484-061-728-036; 101-866-358-809-365; 102-000-964-722-98X; 108-370-770-776-601; 112-682-614-463-686; 120-166-770-024-692; 128-989-457-245-884; 133-226-105-390-194; 154-094-574-732-599; 155-691-175-864-748; 157-135-415-418-575; 158-367-466-672-716; 162-524-610-628-068; 165-756-606-293-842; 168-193-278-954-64X; 168-744-090-896-896; 181-288-411-442-225; 186-655-586-118-519; 191-539-127-334-91X; 194-545-631-692-804; 194-570-919-374-615; 196-882-208-161-504,36

Plots (8 × 8 m2 or 8 × 3m2) received slurry or inorganic fertilizer, and then simulated rainfall (1, 7 and 21 days after slurry/fertilizer application); after each event, runoff and percolates were sampled at various distances downslope (2, 4, 6, and 8 m), and analysed for Cl-,Na+,K+ and faecal bacteria contents. Contaminant concentrations were markedly higher in runoff from the slurry-amended plots than in runoff from the fertiliser-amended plots. After the first rainfall event, some contaminant concentrations in runoff from the slurry-amended plots declined with distance downslope (i.e. with buffer strip width), supporting the relative efficacy of the strip for retaining pollutants. After the second and third rainfall events, by contrast, our results suggest remobilisation of contaminants retained during the first event. Faecal bacteria levels (especially streptococcus levels) remained high throughout the study, even in percolates and runoff collected 8 m downslope after the third rainfall event, and indeed even downslope of the adjacent fertilizer-amended plots (indicating lateral movement): this suggests that bacterial contamination may be the most significant risk arising from slurry application. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Woodcock; Simon G. Potts; Duncan B. Westbury; A. J. Ramsay; M. Lambert; S. J. Harris; Valerie K. Brown,"1. Although the importance of plant community assemblages in structuring invertebrate assemblages is well known, the role that architectural complexity plays is less well understood. In particular, direct empirical data for a range of invertebrate taxa showing how functional groups respond to plant architecture is largely absent from the literature.; ; 2. The significance of sward architectural complexity in determining the species richness of predatory and phytophagous functional groups of spiders, beetles, and true bugs, sampled from 135 field margin plots over 2 years was tested. The present study compares the relative importance of sward architectural complexity to that of plant community assemblage.; ; 3. Sward architectural complexity was found to be a determinant of species richness for all phytophagous and predatory functional groups. When individual species responses were investigated, 62.5% of the spider and beetle species, and 50.0% of the true bugs responded to sward architectural complexity.; ; 4. Interactions between sward architectural complexity and plant community assemblage indicate that the number of invertebrate species supported by the plant community alone could be increased by modification of sward architecture. Management practices could therefore play a key role in diversifying the architectural structure of existing floral assemblages for the benefit of invertebrate assemblages.; ; 5. The contrasting effects of sward architecture on invertebrate functional groups characterised by either direct (phytophagous species) or indirect (predatory species) dependence on plant communities is discussed. It is suggested that for phytophagous taxa, plant community assemblage alone is likely to be insufficient to ensure successful species colonisation or persistence without appropriate development of sward architecture.",32,3,302,311,Colonisation; Invertebrate; Ecology; Range (biology); Assemblage (archaeology); Spider; Plant community; Species richness; Taxon; Biology,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ben_Woodcock/publication/230246632_The_importance_of_sward_architectural_complexity_in_structuring_predatory_and_phytophagous_invertebrate_assemblages/links/0912f50b5ed24874da000000.pdf http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/9401/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00869.x http://eprints.worc.ac.uk/1359/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00869.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00869.x,2003050202,,0,001-956-486-554-700; 003-525-601-982-136; 004-851-850-013-053; 007-827-850-871-938; 014-311-149-543-334; 014-591-903-776-324; 019-750-716-538-504; 020-970-611-966-385; 024-276-184-479-878; 025-149-459-294-317; 059-863-891-880-237; 065-161-518-246-802; 069-559-278-898-558; 071-363-274-178-219; 073-010-346-426-592; 074-786-761-207-084; 076-851-991-319-613; 084-454-852-806-033; 087-687-673-019-639; 096-022-798-581-844; 098-939-648-476-800; 101-987-905-557-98X; 106-761-750-918-882; 110-673-327-117-273; 120-413-224-008-826; 127-029-369-930-692; 132-775-784-488-585; 138-845-934-876-76X; 142-785-416-800-821; 150-196-682-296-140; 165-047-988-032-004; 179-939-285-820-217; 180-077-207-990-770; 194-045-219-104-360,77

Baines; Clive Hambler; Paul J. Johnson; David W. Macdonald; Helen Lawton Smith,"The effects of ten different management regimes on the abundance and species richness of Araneae on pre-existing and newly expanded zones of field margins surrounding arable fields are compared in a large-scale experiment conducted between 1987 and 1991. Most of the management regimes involved varying the timing and frequency with which the field margins were cut. There was no evidence of consistent temporal trends in the abundance and species richness of Araneae on either the existing or expanded zones of the field margins during the first four years of the experiment. However, lowest numbers were recorded before expansion of the margins in 1987, and highest numbers in the final sample, in 1991. Araneae remained less abundant, and less species rich, on the newly expanded than on the existing zones of the field margins four years after they were ' set-aside'. Cutting reduced both abundance and species richness. Regimes which included cutting in mid-summer had a greater impact which persisted for longer than did those involving cutting in spring and autumn. Removal of cut material was associated with lower species richness than leaving it in situ. Sowing the margins with a wild flower seed mixture was associated with increased abundance and species richness of Araneae. Annual spraying with a broad-spectrum, non-persistent herbicide reduced the abundance of Araneae but the effect was not detectable until several months after the application of the spray. Both the species richness and abundance of Araneae were positively correlated with a measure of vegetation height made on the field margins in September, on both the pre-existing and newly expanded zones of the margins. The extent to which management practices which benefit Araneae are compatible with both the management requirements for various other taxa, and the overriding constraint of effective pernicious weed control on field margins, is discussed.",21,1,74,86,Weed control; Sowing; Ecology; Cultural practice; Species richness; Agroecosystem; Taxon; Arable land; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1998.tb00395.x https://www.jstor.org/stable/3683134 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1998.tb00395.x/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1998.tb00395.x,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.1998.tb00395.x,2090338861,,0,001-225-007-289-040; 005-937-930-073-754; 007-827-850-871-938; 019-479-298-680-296; 030-652-847-337-20X; 044-341-011-136-23X; 045-335-685-364-955; 053-551-700-281-485; 062-979-132-597-409; 068-087-699-873-149; 077-701-336-436-648; 082-226-182-630-392; 085-943-980-232-787; 087-186-786-234-321; 114-480-653-531-829; 144-071-794-319-136; 149-178-855-517-470; 153-133-055-256-546; 194-045-219-104-360,93

Whether local species richness is dependent on local or landscape factors can be assessed by examining the relationship between local and landscape species richness. Here we studied how local species richness is related to landscape-level species richness in landscapes differing in agricultural intensity. The relationship was linear for field boundaries in intensively cultivated landscapes and non-linear in less-intensively cultivated landscapes. In landscapes containing semi-natural grasslands (on average 4% of overall land-use), the relationship was non-linear for field boundaries, but linear when considering local species richness of the grasslands themselves. These results show that local factors are more important than landscape factors in determining local species richness in landscapes which contained semi-natural grasslands. Local species richness was limited by landscape factors in intensively cultivated landscapes. This interpretation was supported by the relationship between local species richness and landscape-scale average mobility and generalist percentage of butterfly assemblages. We conclude that the management of field boundary habitat quality for butterflies is expected to be most effective in landscapes with semi-natural grasslands, the species composition of which in turn is dependent on the regional occurrence of grasslands. Based on our results, managing non-crop habitats for the conservation of habitat specialists and species with poor mobility will be most efficient in regions where patches of semi-natural grasslands occur.",35,3,232,238,Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Butterfly; Context (language use); Poor mobility; Semi natural habitats; Generalist and specialist species; Body size and species richness; Species richness; Agroforestry,,,,,http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/en/publications/landscape-context-affects-the-relationship-between-local-and-landscape-species-richness-of-butterflies-in-seminatural-habitats(ae93b2dc-c852-40e6-a2ef-d09a111ae331).html http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2011.07005.x/abstract https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2011.07005.x https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/562484 https://core.ac.uk/display/83795370 https://lup.lub.lu.se/record/ae93b2dc-c852-40e6-a2ef-d09a111ae331,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2011.07005.x,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.2011.07005.x,1980887400,,0,003-079-703-747-674; 003-625-048-428-073; 011-762-019-599-325; 017-708-454-247-712; 022-418-213-259-750; 024-216-425-669-724; 029-825-697-051-499; 031-216-949-664-784; 032-770-350-944-530; 036-224-006-435-531; 039-141-329-184-170; 040-939-848-637-483; 044-629-783-838-349; 054-274-474-416-858; 056-099-523-856-735; 056-585-869-238-25X; 056-789-845-462-569; 060-315-808-164-511; 062-501-527-775-318; 065-687-321-113-981; 070-194-102-378-889; 074-373-874-828-543; 075-336-397-615-388; 080-348-794-816-190; 082-389-624-773-160; 085-687-962-600-03X; 088-723-274-295-38X; 095-071-271-246-817; 098-312-271-690-700; 098-507-810-553-247; 105-301-641-863-030; 108-169-857-391-259; 108-606-742-009-569; 113-464-996-560-182; 114-480-653-531-829; 115-162-803-612-505; 115-606-139-771-296; 117-345-687-903-78X; 131-060-331-668-772; 140-908-676-431-836; 150-275-342-089-773; 152-915-055-063-410; 161-589-110-148-114; 195-845-264-042-244,28

Huerta; R.G.M. de Goede; Mirjam M. Pulleman,"Abstract Earthworm species contribute to soil ecosystem functions in varying ways. Important soil functions like structural maintenance and nutrient cycling are affected by earthworms, thus it is essential to understand how arable farm management influences earthworm species. One aim of arable field margin strips and non-inversion tillage is to enhance agrobiodiversity, however their influence on earthworm species assemblages remains unclear. In particular, on-farm studies conducted over multiple years that capture variability across the landscape are rare. The current study monitored earthworm species assemblages on 4 farms in Hoeksche Waard, The Netherlands, from 2010 to 2012. It was hypothesised that arable field margin strips (FM) and non-inversion tillage (NIT; a reduced tillage system that loosens subsoil at 30−35 cm depth) would have higher earthworm species abundances (epigeics and anecics in particular), soil organic matter, and soil moisture than adjacent mouldboard ploughing (MP) fields, and that earthworm numbers would decrease with distance away from FM into arable fields (MP only). FM contained a mean total earthworm abundance of 284 m −2 and biomass of 84 g m −2 whereas adjacent MP arable fields had only 164 earthworms m −2 and 31 g m −2 . Aporrectodea rosea , Lumbricus rubellus , Lumbricus terrestris , and Lumbricus castaneus were significantly more abundant in FM than adjacent arable soil under MP. However, no decreasing trend with distance from FM was observed in earthworm species abundances. A tillage experiment initiated on the farms with FM showed that relative to MP, NIT significantly increased mean total earthworm abundance by 34% to 275 m −2 and mean total earthworm biomass by 15% to 51 g m −2 overall sampling dates and farms. L. rubellus , A. rosea , and L. terrestris were significantly more abundant overall in NIT than MP. FM and NIT positively affected earthworm species richness and abundances and it is noteworthy that these effects could be observed despite variation in environmental conditions and soil properties between samplings, farms, and crops. Higher top-soil organic matter and less physical disturbance in FM and NIT likely contributed to higher earthworm species richness and abundances. The anecic species L. terrestris (linked to water infiltration and organic matter incorporation) was more abundant in FM, but densities remained very low in arable soil, irrespective of tillage system.",66,,49,56,Tillage; Soil organic matter; Earthworm; Lumbricus terrestris; Lumbricus rubellus; Population; Species richness; Agronomy; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,Netherlands Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment; C.T. de Wit Graduate School for Production Ecology and Resource Conservation; KBIV research program of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs; SNOWMAN,http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/479865 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1164556314001150,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2014.11.007,,10.1016/j.ejsobi.2014.11.007,2141447427,,0,001-674-004-701-427; 006-107-445-442-169; 012-019-125-905-504; 015-806-789-050-432; 019-532-813-961-827; 020-277-480-603-940; 021-442-834-836-016; 022-378-092-015-982; 022-444-557-546-920; 024-054-720-823-182; 026-672-727-584-891; 027-963-132-614-322; 028-146-838-004-688; 028-627-845-842-986; 029-369-543-788-432; 031-776-457-406-389; 034-232-445-141-700; 034-900-115-293-921; 035-845-927-171-679; 041-445-462-945-113; 043-485-882-162-181; 043-721-262-316-102; 048-465-576-777-042; 050-023-621-229-306; 051-239-390-996-522; 053-978-305-864-27X; 055-083-398-263-398; 062-457-526-560-053; 063-141-893-182-571; 063-145-131-461-687; 063-869-983-670-87X; 065-131-520-159-196; 066-561-161-953-166; 068-123-496-822-558; 069-006-333-244-718; 085-223-417-993-186; 088-153-297-768-31X; 093-796-481-923-893; 103-678-114-900-300; 105-978-499-743-20X; 108-606-742-009-569; 119-352-383-206-342; 121-691-035-270-645; 125-107-781-556-450; 125-357-678-676-499; 131-060-331-668-772; 132-048-390-996-279; 132-493-419-916-582; 136-816-007-966-101; 150-325-162-873-23X; 158-854-628-533-38X; 159-295-591-824-017; 176-657-078-819-673; 188-049-786-375-395; 188-485-343-828-456; 191-223-720-787-10X; 193-766-251-383-850; 196-533-079-088-295,25

Lee; Fabian D. Menalled; Douglas A. Landis,"Summary 1. Carabid beetles are polyphagous predators that can act as biological control agents of insect pests and weeds. While current agricultural practices often create a harsh environment, habitat management such as the establishment of within-field refuges has been proposed to enhance carabid beetle abundance and impact. We examined the joint effects of refuge habitats and insecticide application on carabid activity density (parameter of population density and relative activity) and species composition in a cornfield. 2. Our 2-year study comprised four treatments: (i) ‐refuge/‐insecticide; (ii) + refuge/ ‐insecticide; (iii) ‐refuge/+insecticide; (iv) + refuge/ + insecticide. Refuge strips consisted of grasses, legumes and perennial flowering plants. ‘‐Refuge’ strips were planted with corn and not treated with insecticide. 3. Before planting and insecticide application, carabid activity density in the crop areas was similar across all treatments. Insecticide application immediately reduced carabid activity density and altered community composition in the crop area. 4. Refuge strips had significantly higher activity density of beetles than ‐refuge strips before planting and during the summer. 5. During summer, as new carabids emerged and insecticide toxicity declined, the presence of refuge strips influenced carabids in the adjacent crop area. Carabid activity density within crop areas previously treated with insecticide was significantly higher when adjacent to refuge strips. Also, carabid communities within insecticide-treated crop areas were affected by the presence or absence of a refuge strip. 6. The presence of refuge strips did not consistently augment carabid numbers in crop areas where insecticide was not applied. One explanation may be that insecticides decreased the quality of crop habitat to carabids by depletion of prey and direct mortality. However, subsequent rebounds in prey density and the absence of competing predators may make these areas relatively more attractive than unperturbed crop habitats to carabid colonization from refuges. 7. This study demonstrates that refuges may buffer the negative consequences of insecticide application on carabids in adjacent fields. Diversifying agro-ecosystems with refuge habitats may be a viable strategy for maintaining carabid populations in disturbed agricultural landscapes to keep pests below outbreak levels.",38,2,472,483,Biological pest control; Integrated pest management; Pesticide; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Population density; PEST analysis; Agroecosystem; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/2655812 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00602.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00602.x/abstract https://lter.kbs.msu.edu/citations/2640 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00602.x https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00602.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00602.x,,10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00602.x,2154206394,,0,001-474-276-006-106; 005-028-851-696-576; 006-160-831-631-796; 007-625-495-965-212; 008-608-775-518-291; 009-734-180-719-581; 010-888-549-334-33X; 010-945-646-716-071; 011-789-039-750-846; 013-270-209-241-22X; 014-809-297-009-430; 014-941-860-389-566; 017-142-360-466-615; 019-456-510-284-708; 019-658-253-028-863; 022-070-333-305-083; 026-166-501-144-752; 026-922-796-528-470; 027-873-912-072-078; 030-580-481-786-771; 030-652-847-337-20X; 033-145-570-790-134; 034-985-325-044-398; 037-731-106-378-493; 038-321-854-469-870; 040-815-928-482-982; 041-962-175-932-702; 042-379-932-616-44X; 044-050-646-677-718; 045-924-425-733-406; 047-184-187-145-124; 047-898-549-829-481; 048-240-741-329-183; 051-103-549-479-234; 054-226-689-654-507; 055-083-398-263-398; 055-697-373-449-344; 055-911-047-425-210; 056-587-738-715-983; 056-892-041-411-85X; 056-892-630-404-500; 057-612-922-967-628; 058-743-931-737-265; 060-626-812-234-007; 062-036-445-726-722; 064-893-774-544-494; 067-639-922-939-929; 069-288-842-490-19X; 069-379-822-515-162; 069-622-233-079-646; 072-678-066-297-398; 072-817-046-222-302; 073-892-938-690-183; 078-910-780-389-507; 079-669-821-169-139; 080-139-567-968-521; 082-091-227-062-603; 084-384-881-244-614; 084-387-070-806-39X; 084-572-874-444-640; 085-372-195-731-912; 087-186-786-234-321; 088-399-968-370-207; 089-253-154-997-777; 090-414-638-170-776; 090-754-443-858-977; 097-164-580-285-460; 110-684-291-574-379; 121-270-336-123-002; 122-593-714-312-795; 123-653-571-393-994; 125-647-410-272-819; 132-569-724-005-273; 134-797-888-874-528; 134-829-434-760-01X; 134-921-760-522-115; 137-942-105-992-390; 139-460-793-557-755; 139-909-439-900-001; 140-873-753-237-870; 142-464-875-172-783; 145-653-851-729-665; 149-027-017-028-450; 149-431-649-896-445; 159-198-285-228-060; 166-002-533-461-846; 172-907-036-981-609; 183-952-378-399-880; 184-407-822-732-428; 187-941-892-082-802; 191-535-840-968-047; 194-482-255-430-935,166

Ross; Malcolm McLeod,"Abstract A series of field experiments assessed the ability of sloping (8°) 5‐m‐long by 2‐m‐wide grass buffer strips to trap the faecal microbes Escherichia coli and Campylobacter. The microbes, applied within dairy‐farm effluent, were washed into the strips by surface runoff generated at rates of 4–13 litres/min using a water sprinkler system. The effluent and surface and subsurface outflows at the lower end of each plot were sampled for microbial analysis. Flow rate influenced the timing of peak microbial concentration in outflow and the recovery of both microbes. Under high flow, recovery rates varied from 15–100%, and hence entrapment was often minimal. Under the slowest rate of water application, entrapment was much greater (≥95%), at least over the 40 min of water application. During large runoff events, and where preferential flowpaths occur, buffer strips need to exceed 5 m in length in order to markedly reduce the delivery of faecal microbes to waterways. Of those microbes trapped in the grass st...",47,4,565,574,Animal science; Effluent; Ecology; MICROBIAL CONCENTRATION; Sprinkler system; High flow; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Biology,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00288233.2004.9513621,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288233.2004.9513621,,10.1080/00288233.2004.9513621,2042782704,,0,007-071-648-273-363; 007-550-413-175-53X; 014-561-967-561-763; 031-334-745-801-668; 031-492-098-774-731; 040-507-938-290-621; 054-903-773-386-539; 113-496-738-919-590; 169-489-600-409-981; 169-607-559-923-667; 175-302-560-900-147; 184-287-042-120-697,29

B. Parkin; Matthew J. Helmers; Xiaobo Zhou; Michael J. Castellano,"Inclusion of perennial vegetation filter strips (PFSs) in the toeslope of annual cropland watersheds can decrease NO₃⁻–N losses to ground and surface waters. Although PFSs are similar to riparian buffers, the processes responsible for NO₃⁻–N removal from PFSs are not well understood. Our objectives were to (i) determine the importance of denitrification as a sink for NO₃⁻–N loss from PFSs and (ii) evaluate how PFSs alter the biophysical processes that affect the relative importance of N₂O and N₂ emissions. To address our objectives, we used a coupled field laboratory approach with experimental watersheds that included the following treatments: (i) PFSs covering the bottom 10% of the watershed and an annual corn–soybean crop rotation covering the remaining upslope 90% (PFS); (ii) 100% corn–soybean rotation (CORN); and (iii) 19-yr-old 100% restored native grassland (RNG). In situ N₂O flux rates and laboratory N₂O/(N₂ + N₂O) ratios were highest in CORN watersheds followed by PFS and RNG watersheds. In contrast, potentially mineralizable C and denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) were highest in PFS and RNG watersheds and lowest in CORN watersheds. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between N₂O/(N₂ + N₂O) ratio and DEA. In the laboratory, N₂ fluxes were highest in PFS followed by RNG and CORN. These results indicate that PFS watersheds support greater total denitrification while emitting less N₂O than croplands. Greater potentially mineralizable C in PFS and RNG suggest C availability is an important factor affecting more complete denitrification. These results suggest PFSs function similar to riparian buffers and have potential to reduce NO₃⁻–N losses from annual croplands by denitrification to N₂.",79,1,239,250,Riparian zone; Watershed; Crop rotation; Perennial plant; Grassland; Nitrous oxide; Negative correlation; Environmental science; Agronomy; Denitrification,,,,U.S. Department of Agriculture,https://works.bepress.com/matthew_helmers/123/download/ http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015SSASJ..79..239I/abstract https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/sssaj/abstracts/79/1/239 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6696859 https://core.ac.uk/display/38941951 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/agron_pubs/29/ https://works.bepress.com/matthew_helmers/123/ https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj2014.05.0221 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1028&context=agron_pubs https://core.ac.uk/download/38941951.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2014.05.0221,,10.2136/sssaj2014.05.0221,2165398866,,0,001-268-659-882-253; 001-751-662-056-163; 002-638-519-115-222; 003-116-810-612-863; 006-550-081-866-468; 006-983-498-572-602; 008-719-189-249-131; 015-514-563-181-208; 016-475-292-873-68X; 018-103-292-961-116; 018-813-151-598-479; 021-264-049-632-756; 021-470-036-776-774; 023-813-165-307-848; 025-714-041-289-368; 030-356-806-220-500; 032-893-836-248-834; 038-335-400-539-341; 044-679-967-186-088; 046-292-313-541-673; 049-652-746-072-986; 050-633-878-665-03X; 053-107-530-563-971; 055-192-571-710-917; 065-087-306-653-331; 073-703-019-282-474; 075-429-883-991-330; 076-401-091-621-608; 081-541-203-390-716; 082-972-330-209-378; 085-627-940-653-689; 095-661-618-303-658; 096-695-870-619-787; 101-224-352-710-810; 102-204-619-422-753; 102-220-687-932-261; 102-901-034-424-714; 103-402-675-201-297; 115-025-564-202-072; 117-662-774-278-336; 118-235-652-966-907; 121-468-243-703-60X; 122-807-235-991-138; 124-701-911-416-17X; 125-872-242-766-633; 132-266-632-139-583; 141-101-347-131-583; 146-145-195-912-167; 148-720-814-313-501; 150-539-908-471-485; 165-303-507-116-988; 176-785-973-569-670; 178-533-853-701-173; 179-022-488-850-817; 179-305-245-593-561,26

This study was developed to evaluate the potential of selected management practices (MP's) for reducing total solids, nutrients and pesticides from discharge water in order to improve the surface water quality in southwest Louisiana. Five rice plots located on the Rice Research Station in Crowley, LA represented the different MP's to be evaluated. The five water seeding MP's were: a.1‐no till; a.2‐water cultivation with 30‐day settling; a.3‐dry cultivation with clear water planting; a.4‐mudding‐in with vegetated filter, and b‐mudding‐in (control).

Its widespread decline in western Europe has been attributed to agricultural intensification. Attempts to restore populations have concentrated upon habitat management. In France, a mosaic of strips planted with maize- or kale-based mixtures is widely used to benefit the grey partridge on intensively cultivated farmlands. The rationale for planting these summer-to-winter cover strips is to increase the overwinter survival rate and hence breeding density. Although this policy is costly to apply, there is little information on its effectiveness.; ; 2; We tested effectiveness of this management scheme as a practical way of improving or restoring partridge populations. We present data from a 6-year before–after control–impact (BACI) experiment replicated across four study sites. We monitored partridge populations to estimate breeding density, reproductive success and overwinter mortality.; ; 3; During the course of the study, no partridge population increase occurred on managed areas compared with control areas. Wildlife cover strips did not improve reproductive success but were associated with higher overwinter ‘apparent mortality’ rates.; ; 4; Some field data suggested that there was a predation risk at cover strip–field edges. Cover strips may concentrate a number of species within small isolated areas and may act, under some circumstances, as an ecological trap for prey species such as the grey partridge. Due to these complex and unforeseen interactions, this habitat management measure proved unsuitable for partridge restoration.; ; 5; Synthesis and applications. This study has demonstrated the necessity of field experiments at a farm-scale to test the effectiveness of habitat management schemes. A priori assumptions based on smaller scale studies, even if they are supported by some field evidence, can be misleading because they fail to capture the emergent properties of larger scale systems. This study is a specific illustration of how the BACI approach is a powerful tool for addressing wildlife management problems at large spatial scales.",41,5,846,857,Reproductive success; Wildlife conservation; Wildlife management; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Ecological trap; Geography; Grey partridge; Wildlife; Agroforestry,,,,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00939.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00939.x/full https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00939.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00939.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00939.x,,10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00939.x,1597350551,,0,004-010-787-386-28X; 007-416-181-403-689; 012-499-497-461-372; 016-421-756-148-512; 018-028-975-115-624; 018-655-554-147-217; 021-507-080-163-445; 022-667-644-785-266; 023-935-502-746-047; 024-867-683-320-604; 026-029-480-862-892; 027-185-568-099-888; 033-090-661-724-372; 045-445-063-674-649; 047-000-620-546-182; 053-235-742-998-658; 054-194-261-317-098; 064-837-757-507-919; 068-258-337-754-12X; 068-452-604-669-157; 074-793-529-288-006; 076-919-109-535-676; 078-108-526-839-471; 080-621-909-570-00X; 086-184-504-457-784; 093-835-124-539-323; 094-927-462-200-693; 095-014-169-963-827; 097-657-189-866-102; 100-681-404-630-351; 105-626-400-923-835; 109-564-179-818-191; 111-085-619-662-631; 113-066-359-815-724; 122-307-635-255-948; 130-217-261-489-483; 139-200-896-129-808; 156-066-906-763-397; 158-990-919-499-51X; 159-943-070-825-906; 161-974-661-329-991; 171-875-346-786-761,75

Petrovan; Alastair I. Ward; Philip Wheeler,"Habitat improvements through agri-environment schemes are the most important tool for reversing biodiversity declines in European farmland. However, little is known about their impact on mammals, including the brown hare, a priority species for conservation in the UK. We studied radio-collared hares for 13 months in a mixed agricultural area using ‘homing in’ to provide high spatial-resolution fixes. Hares selected agri-environment field margins during both active and inactive periods and used the areas in the middle of large fields less frequently than those closer to the field boundaries. Blocks of woods and lines of trees were selected as resting sites while sheep-grazed fields were generally avoided throughout the year. We suggest that agri-environment schemes targeted at creating and increasing non-farmed habitat features associated with field boundaries and reducing sward depletion through less intensive or mixed grazing regimes could prove beneficial for populations of this priority species in farmland.",16,3,344,352,Agriculture; Biodiversity; Wildlife conservation; Wildlife management; Habitat; Ecology; Grazing; Brown hare; Agricultural land; Agroforestry; Biology,,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acv.12002/abstract https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acv.12002 https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acv.12002 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20133209015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/acv.12002,,10.1111/acv.12002,1555926908,,0,000-289-750-853-185; 002-040-198-730-761; 006-739-386-682-642; 007-657-637-889-689; 008-276-606-479-115; 012-467-922-110-64X; 013-157-894-380-126; 016-421-756-148-512; 017-935-193-721-008; 020-131-452-110-549; 022-101-299-722-48X; 028-942-092-865-568; 031-592-787-048-258; 035-310-756-310-433; 038-618-402-954-434; 038-803-541-291-540; 043-009-269-441-396; 043-303-506-011-38X; 051-326-658-145-581; 052-363-993-930-092; 056-099-523-856-735; 058-072-354-693-578; 060-114-103-966-089; 062-836-754-458-51X; 065-379-780-279-118; 066-882-160-758-008; 068-452-604-669-157; 070-793-817-546-801; 071-192-821-815-608; 071-245-262-326-969; 074-793-529-288-006; 080-264-796-295-060; 093-895-719-987-832; 100-611-157-697-386; 103-998-060-603-011; 108-336-813-188-908; 108-606-742-009-569; 108-629-752-172-521; 127-373-468-798-765; 131-060-331-668-772; 133-858-248-195-498; 134-813-206-517-492; 143-140-548-939-305; 157-589-203-629-49X; 161-181-529-153-554; 169-297-520-424-667,57

We assessed habitat factors correlated with diversity, distribution, and insect-foraging activity of native birds on farms in north-central Florida and then characterized common bird species that consumed insect biomass in crops as ""functional insectivores"" (birds most likely to contribute to pest control). Analyses of point-count survey data and foraging observations collected over 2 years on paired organic and conventional farm sites indicated that (1) farms supported most (82-96%) land birds known to breed in the region; (2) bird species richness and abundance varied significantly with matrix habitat and field border type (but not with year or farm management type); (3) the highest bird abundances were associated with mixed crop plantings, field borders, and adjacent matrix composed of forest and hedge; and (4) abundances of 10 species identified as functional insectivores were primarily influenced by crop type (mixed crops attracted significantly more insect foragers into fields than monocrops).

Microbial biomass and the content of microbial carbon in humus (C mic /C org ) decreased in the following order: soils under forest cenoses— mowed meadow—10-year arable land—46- and 75-year arable land. The amount of microbial carbon in the long-plowed horizon was 40% of its content in the upper horizon of natural forest. Arable soils were character- ized by a lower metabolic diversity of microbial community and by the highest portion of microorganisms able to grow directly on glucose introduced into soil. The effects of different scenarios of carbon sequestration in soil on the amounts and activity of microbial biomass are discussed.",77,1,99,106,Soil water; Soil microbiology; Carbon sequestration; Chernozem; Biomass; Environmental science; Humus; Agronomy; Arable land; Microbial population biology,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0026261708010141 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18365729 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18365729/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0026261708010141,http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/s0026261708010141,,10.1134/s0026261708010141,2040058591,,0,019-220-273-697-670; 020-476-640-517-489; 021-495-489-823-204; 021-919-807-777-175; 030-478-915-403-440; 031-531-674-312-631; 034-387-696-661-758; 042-220-297-354-721; 064-491-965-906-417; 069-108-243-232-374; 071-644-692-794-007; 072-376-017-995-09X; 084-449-369-648-999; 094-593-018-155-606; 113-489-587-504-930; 116-223-425-182-685; 118-128-980-666-053; 140-701-571-997-405,23

Inclán; Matteo Dainese; Pierfilippo Cerretti; Dino Paniccia; Lorenzo Marini,"Abstract The introduction and conservation of field margins have been proposed as an intervention to counteract the decline in farmland biodiversity. However, how these margins can affect the movement of species and individuals (i.e. spillover) of natural enemies between field margins and crop is still unclear. In this work, we investigated the spillover of two different groups of natural enemies: tachinids (Diptera: Tachinidae) and aphidophagous hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae). For comparison we also investigated the response of non-aphidophagous hoverflies. We examined the spillover from two types of field margin (grass margin vs. hedgerow + grass margin) to adjacent maize fields located in landscapes with different proportion of arable land. The spillover of natural enemies was affected by the field margins, but the response varied between insect groups. The spillover of tachinids was higher from the grass margin than from hedgerows, suggesting that the spillover of this group may be related to the low contrast between the vegetation structure of the margin and the crop. In contrast to tachinids, the abundance of aphidophagous hoverflies was higher toward the center of the crop field, independently of the type of field margin. The spillover of non-aphidophagous hoverflies was not affected by the type of field margin. These species were only affected by the landscape composition as their species richness and abundance were higher in landscapes with low amounts of arable land. Measures focusing on the creation and management of field margins need to consider the local contrast between field margins and crops in relation to the life-history traits of different taxa.",17,1,33,42,Biodiversity; Crop; Vegetation; Ecology; Geography; Tachinidae; Species richness; Agroforestry; Spillover effect; Arable land; Abundance (ecology),,,,University of Padova; European Community's Seventh Framework Programme,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179115001061 https://core.ac.uk/display/80155247,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2015.08.005,,10.1016/j.baae.2015.08.005,1161210009,,0,003-978-114-889-219; 004-408-282-086-003; 004-472-145-506-143; 005-574-938-556-945; 006-394-945-371-082; 010-171-254-110-63X; 011-508-246-956-659; 012-432-436-243-64X; 012-539-445-932-252; 012-595-707-248-992; 013-439-054-708-024; 017-708-454-247-712; 017-786-901-727-296; 020-018-619-332-748; 022-321-534-473-933; 022-438-869-235-426; 025-775-649-567-265; 028-851-162-526-112; 029-988-354-588-530; 031-906-714-715-573; 032-361-491-904-324; 037-314-992-178-084; 039-529-237-343-040; 042-303-914-852-499; 043-515-817-797-96X; 044-633-573-761-568; 046-801-703-740-400; 049-091-169-377-597; 049-127-174-557-906; 049-567-584-028-555; 056-789-845-462-569; 060-352-081-906-168; 062-554-425-020-511; 064-939-290-921-514; 076-863-055-982-955; 078-152-796-237-76X; 086-359-248-425-522; 088-426-133-192-335; 092-481-430-798-700; 098-739-512-303-189; 103-348-929-033-891; 105-051-926-097-932; 110-380-064-799-444; 113-365-099-387-283; 114-519-845-592-808; 114-955-369-191-720; 115-483-622-314-813; 115-507-657-132-984; 117-345-687-903-78X; 124-222-927-328-141; 126-322-219-192-539; 127-747-168-852-33X; 132-980-742-169-431; 145-523-815-049-35X; 150-275-342-089-773; 154-024-131-760-095; 159-992-062-101-765; 175-463-126-698-414; 192-923-404-596-807; 195-618-519-387-640,17

Koks; Frank Berendse; G.R. de Snoo,"Abstract Agri-environment schemes have been established in many European countries to counteract the ongoing decline of farmland birds. In this study, the selection of foraging habitat by breeding skylarks was examined in relation to agri-environmental management on Dutch farmland. Field margin use was quantified and, based on the observed flight distances, the appropriateness of the current spatial arrangement of field margins in the study landscape was evaluated. Skylarks preferred field margins for foraging over all other habitat types relative to their surface area within the territories. The visiting rate of field margins decreased with increasing distance to the nest, and especially dropped markedly when the distance between the nest and a field margin exceeded 100 m. Analysis of the current spatial arrangement of field margins in the landscape suggested that the area of skylark breeding habitat within 100 m of a field margin could be increased by 46%. This was due to the placement of field margins alongside unsuitable breeding habitat and to the positioning of field margins at short distances from each other. The efficiency of agri-environmental management for skylarks can likely be improved by a more careful spatial arrangement of field margins in the landscape.",170,,10,15,Seasonal breeder; Biodiversity; Field (geography); Foraging; Nest; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Alauda; Food resources,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880913000662 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880913000662 http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/439630,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.03.001,,10.1016/j.agee.2013.03.001,2006644968,,0,002-900-720-944-007; 003-223-037-571-948; 008-225-619-668-580; 012-267-243-122-028; 014-630-972-063-626; 020-131-452-110-549; 023-847-672-885-998; 026-527-744-858-38X; 027-068-264-288-767; 041-704-628-510-931; 043-009-269-441-396; 049-977-293-677-848; 051-824-580-453-278; 053-787-579-034-941; 056-099-523-856-735; 056-962-675-879-834; 058-089-327-815-315; 058-569-963-310-089; 059-804-606-271-839; 063-993-986-206-755; 064-454-510-982-621; 064-717-657-434-648; 072-009-532-293-469; 073-935-983-022-480; 074-225-773-604-407; 076-278-055-254-459; 095-369-730-713-771; 097-123-929-736-172; 099-921-237-201-045; 103-573-046-017-776; 117-119-858-150-626; 124-079-930-184-362; 124-319-214-482-940; 130-011-136-615-512; 133-858-248-195-498; 145-728-200-767-581; 149-200-651-727-319; 150-275-342-089-773; 150-325-162-873-23X; 165-627-368-251-055; 165-682-376-569-823; 176-962-359-944-180; 179-048-991-295-983,18

McKergow; David M. Weaver; Ian P. Prosser; Rodger B. Grayson; Adrian E.G. Reed,"Riparian vegetation can trap sediment and nutrients sourced from hillslopes and reduce stream bank erosion. This study presents results from a 10-year stream monitoring program (1991–2000), in a 6 km2 agricultural catchment near Albany, Western Australia. After 6 years, a 1.7 km stream reach was fenced, planted with eucalyptus species and managed independently from the adjacent paddocks. Streamflow, nutrient and sediment concentration data were collected at the downstream end of the fenced riparian area, so there are data for before and after improved riparian management. Suspended sediment (SS) concentrations fell dramatically following improved riparian management; the median event mean concentration (EMC) dropped from 147 to 9.9 mg l−1. Maximum SS concentrations dropped by an order of magnitude. As a result, sediment exports from the catchment decreased following improved riparian management, from over 100 to less than 10 kg ha−1 yr−1. Observations suggest that this was the result of reduced bank erosion and increased channel stability. Riparian management had limited impact on total phosphorus (TP) concentrations or loads, but contributed to a change in phosphorus (P) form. Before improved riparian management, around half of the P was transported attached to sediment, but after, the median filterable reactive P (FRP) to TP ratio increased to 0.75. In addition, the median FRP EMC increased by 60% and the raw median FRP concentration increased from 0.18 to 0.35 mg l−1. These results suggest that there was a change in the dominant P form, from TP to FRP. Changes in total nitrogen (TN) following improved riparian management were less clear. There were reductions in TN concentrations at high flows, but little change in the loads or EMC. This study demonstrates the benefits of riparian management in reducing stream bank erosion, but suggests that in catchments with sandy, low P sorption soils, there may be limitations on the effectiveness of riparian buffers for reducing P and N exports",270,3-4,253,272,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0022-1694(02)00286-x,,10.1016/s0022-1694(02)00286-x,,,0,005-548-507-810-658; 010-083-294-693-008; 011-259-237-483-648; 018-079-562-717-66X; 026-329-478-799-745; 027-619-990-205-08X; 038-659-320-814-260; 042-036-288-239-561; 046-614-033-566-832; 061-886-185-960-41X; 062-459-234-621-52X; 066-947-210-171-825; 076-826-572-086-275; 081-279-044-196-105; 083-734-120-117-144; 086-674-928-003-809; 104-230-077-662-702; 108-877-779-124-880; 111-879-604-356-759; 122-420-168-066-607; 134-413-323-267-741; 153-472-582-944-670; 169-933-739-132-938,129

Mankin; Daniel M. Ngandu; Charles J. Barden; Stacy L. Hutchinson; Wayne A. Geyer,":  Riparian buffer forests and vegetative filter strips are widely recommended for improving surface water quality, but grass-shrub riparian buffer system (RBSs) are less well studied. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of buffer width and vegetation type on the key processes and overall reductions of total suspended solids (TSS), phosphorus (P), and nitrogen (N) from simulated runoff passed through established (7-year old) RBSs. Nine 1-m RBS plots, with three replicates of three vegetation types (all natural selection grasses, two-segment buffer with native grasses and plum shrub, and two-segment buffer with natural selection grasses and plum shrub) and widths ranging from 8.3 to 16.1 m, received simulated runoff having 4,433 mg/l TSS from on-site soil, 1.6 mg/l total P, and 20 mg/l total N. Flow-weighted samples were collected by using Runoff Sampling System (ROSS) units. The buffers were very efficient in removal of sediments, N, and P, with removal efficiencies strongly linked to infiltration. Mass and concentration reductions averaged 99.7% and 97.9% for TSS, 91.8% and 42.9% for total P, and 92.1% and 44.4% for total N. Infiltration alone could account for >75% of TSS removal, >90% of total P removal, and >90% of total N removal.

The field was subdivided by five 1.5 m wide weed-strips leaving 12, 24 and 36 m between the strips. In 1990 significantly higher activity densities and number of species were found in the strips. In 1991, however, both number of species and activity densities of ground beetles in the weed-strips and the cereal parts in between were similar. In 1991, activity density in cereal parts between weed-strips was significantly higher than in a bordering control area. Most of the activity densities of all 23 abundant species were significantly higher in the strip-managed area than in the control area. Furthermore, the number of species in the strip-managed area was higher. In addition, most sampling dates (1990 and 1991) revealed a significant negative regression between activity density and distance from the first strip, i.e. width of the cereal parts between the strips. Strip-management seems to be a way to increase ground beetle densities considerably by providing better food supplies and more suitable overwintering sites.",73,1,1,9,Global biodiversity; Control area; Population density; PEST analysis; Overwintering; Winter cereal; Ground beetle; Botany; Agronomy; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND20435729 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1994.tb01833.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1994.tb01833.x,,10.1111/j.1570-7458.1994.tb01833.x,2093525485,,0,005-991-910-810-152; 010-945-646-716-071; 013-108-235-924-512; 016-823-705-101-257; 022-070-333-305-083; 027-360-876-274-76X; 030-652-847-337-20X; 047-634-751-413-966; 051-103-549-479-234; 053-343-090-208-443; 054-348-758-899-854; 056-892-041-411-85X; 059-675-501-993-001; 069-379-822-515-162; 072-817-046-222-302; 083-020-071-342-26X; 087-186-786-234-321; 096-974-408-461-061; 099-688-156-404-854; 101-777-378-567-805; 111-210-309-571-443; 123-421-331-693-40X; 145-807-568-207-49X; 149-431-649-896-445; 167-463-043-637-659; 173-340-205-992-352,98
065-544-803-132-001,Mortality of pollen beetle (Meligethes spp.) larvae due to predators and parasitoids in rape fields and the effect of conservation strips,,2002,journal article,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",01678809,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Rudolf Büchi,"Abstract In 1996–1999, different mortality factors of pollen beetle larvae were investigated in twenty six rape fields in the northern part of Switzerland which had either a wild flower strip or an extensively managed meadow adjacent to the long side of the field. At 3 and 30 m into the crop from the conservation strip, total mortality, mortality from predators, parasitoids and unspecified factors were measured. Total pollen beetle larval mortality was 66–96%. Mortality caused by predators was 16–27% and there was no significant difference between mortality at 3 m and that 30 m from the extensively managed meadows. However, in fields with wild flower strips adjacent to them, the percentage mortality from predators was significantly greater at 30 m than at 3 m. The range of parasitism of pollen beetle larvae was 0–54% and was on average greater at 3 m than at 30 m. In fields with wild flower strips, the percentage parasitism with Tersilochus heterocerus was significantly higher than in fields with extensively managed meadows. However, mortality from all parasitoids was only 1–2% and there was no significant difference between 3 and 30 m. The effect of parasitoids on pollen beetle mortality was masked by the high unspecified mortality and the mortality from predators. The unspecified mortality was 46–72% and was significantly greater in 1998 and 1999 than in 1996 and 1997. These differences are probably because of meteorological factors (wet in 1999 and dry in 1998). The possible influences of the two types of conservation strips on pollen beetle larval density were investigated. The results show that in fields with adjacent wild flower strips, the pollen beetle larvae were more evenly distributed (but not significantly so) than in fields with extensively managed meadows where larval density decreases faster from the edge into the rape field.",90,3,255,263,Biological pest control; Larva; Predation; PEST analysis; Meligethes aeneus; Parasitism; Parasitoid; Pollen beetle; Botany; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880901002134,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-8809(01)00213-4,,10.1016/s0167-8809(01)00213-4,2057987954,,0,015-522-490-223-197; 015-578-334-267-852; 021-199-110-991-742; 032-518-812-117-974; 038-684-107-777-426; 045-486-365-427-994; 047-451-780-735-831; 055-083-398-263-398; 056-892-041-411-85X; 069-379-822-515-162; 069-380-765-701-521; 079-478-547-689-067; 123-653-571-393-994; 132-113-917-163-782; 141-759-936-693-745; 149-431-649-896-445; 151-431-337-222-216; 166-249-452-125-482,58

Nicholls; Michael P. Parrella; Miguel A. Altieri,"During 1996 and 1997, two adjacent 2.5 has organic vineyard blocks (A and B) were monitored to assess the distributional and abundance patterns of the Western grape leafhopper Erythroneura elegantulaOsborn (Homoptera: Cicadellidae) and its parasitoid Anagrus eposGirault (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae), Western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) and generalist predators. The main difference between blocks was that block A was cut across by a corridor composed of 65 flowering plant species which was connected to the surrounding riparian habitat, whereas block B had no plant corridor. In both years, leafhopper adults and nymphs and thrips tended to be more numerous in the middle rows of block A and less abundant in border rows close to the forest and corridor where predators were more abundant. The complex of predators circulating through the corridor moved to the adjacent vine rows and exerted a regulatory impact on herbivores present in such rows. In block B all insects were evenly distributed over the field, no obvious density gradient was detected from the edges into the center of the field. Although it is suspected that A. epos depended on food resources of the corridor, it did not display a gradient from this rich flowering area into the middle of the field. Likewise no differences in rates of egg parasitism of leafhoppers could be detected in vines near the corridor or in the vineyard center. The presence of riparian habitats enhanced predator colonization and abundance on adjacent vineyards, although this influence was limited by the distance to which natural enemies dispersed into the vineyard. However, the corridor amplified this influence by enhancing timely circulation and dispersal movement of predators into the center of the field.",16,2,133,146,Riparian zone; Predation; Ecology; Thrips; Western flower thrips; Insect biodiversity; Anagrus epos; Vineyard; Biological dispersal; Biology,,,,,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=729150 http://agroecology.berkeley.edu/resources/Nicholls_2001_Effects_vegetational_corridor.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1011128222867 http://esa.ipb.pt/pdf/Ref12PTDCAGRAAM1029082008.pdf http://www.agroeco.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/clara-corridor.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1011128222867,,10.1023/a:1011128222867,2102971892,,0,016-833-602-863-485; 030-165-394-521-128; 034-985-325-044-398; 037-768-879-567-930; 049-556-511-622-111; 056-892-041-411-85X; 064-893-774-544-494; 067-277-473-537-389; 069-379-822-515-162; 084-387-070-806-39X; 087-186-786-234-321; 098-187-200-442-195; 102-378-349-003-574; 114-931-372-338-782; 122-726-422-926-011; 135-277-247-218-421,176

Jacot; Roland Kölliker; J. Enkerli,"Abstract Metarhizium spp. are insect pathogenic fungal species, which are widely used as biological control agents for pest insects. The natural occurrence of Metarhizium spp. and their potential for natural regulation of pest insects have obtained more and more attention because of an increasing demand for sustainable agriculture. Therefore, the interest on management strategies enhancing the natural occurrence of Metarhizium spp. and consequently the success of conservation biological control has been growing. Such strategies include habitat management as well as establishment of semi-natural habitat types, which may provide a refuge for Metarhizium spp. and may allow for recolonization of adjacent arable fields. The present study provides an overview of the densities of Metarhizium clade 1 consisting of M. majus, M. guizhouense, M. pinghaense, M. anisopliae, M. robertsii, and M. brunneum in different habitat types at field, local, and regional scales in Swiss agricultural landscapes. Soil samples were analyzed for Metarhizium clade 1 densities with a cultivation-independent qPCR-based detection and quantification tool. Based on this tool, 19.3% of 176 collected soil samples were tested positive for Metarhizium clade 1. The densities of Metarhizium clade 1 were heterogeneously distributed among the soil samples and differed significantly among sampled areas as well as sites. Despite this heterogeneity significant habitat-specific associations were observed. High Metarhizium clade 1 densities were found in soil samples collected from low-input permanent grassland and improved field margins indicating that both semi-natural habitat types may provide potential refuges for Metarhizium clade 1 species. Based on these results, more detailed analyses can be performed in permanent grassland and improved field margins to identify factors, which may promote the natural occurrence of Metarhizium clade 1 species and improve their function as natural regulator of pest insect populations.",52,,20,28,Biological pest control; Habitat; Ecology; PEST analysis; Grassland; Spatial distribution; Metarhizium; Clade; Arable land; Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139311002265 https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND601118963 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139311002265,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2011.10.007,,10.1016/j.apsoil.2011.10.007,2038527365,,0,007-868-552-321-381; 008-225-619-668-580; 009-090-224-676-608; 011-572-528-623-306; 015-987-007-908-461; 017-536-736-961-713; 025-209-505-857-611; 028-319-772-589-857; 028-319-832-777-009; 033-436-774-585-87X; 034-976-614-134-002; 039-621-838-412-365; 040-453-557-620-390; 043-940-041-145-856; 043-964-532-176-952; 046-457-351-731-163; 046-563-268-103-456; 046-771-875-905-019; 051-592-257-802-482; 053-247-019-338-739; 055-625-910-432-693; 057-150-122-288-519; 061-017-305-686-44X; 066-050-943-013-06X; 066-651-496-203-817; 071-380-704-467-390; 075-790-324-938-450; 076-736-082-802-954; 078-438-803-623-970; 087-507-618-965-111; 092-488-798-104-385; 093-276-268-905-574; 094-895-891-919-723; 095-220-834-363-942; 095-229-307-131-809; 098-275-229-793-108; 104-074-844-536-386; 104-715-530-343-714; 105-115-593-951-298; 106-240-423-361-163; 108-935-630-014-707; 116-704-229-511-725; 117-993-897-042-186; 125-500-166-169-070; 125-512-608-629-475; 126-789-023-163-372; 140-461-641-557-107; 141-880-898-954-805; 142-103-971-611-666; 148-012-922-876-830; 157-115-581-957-699; 160-213-875-213-422; 165-095-858-579-438; 166-138-237-907-324; 168-824-724-646-590; 170-904-373-019-705; 173-010-046-737-992; 184-788-375-179-254,38

Veres; Paola Tirello; Alberto Pozzebon; Carlo Duso; Giuseppe Zanin,"When a pesticide is applied in a vineyard, the fraction can drift away from the target and affect the abundance of beneficial arthropods in adjacent crops or hedgerows. A field experiment was conducted in north-eastern Italy using an air-assisted sprayer in order to evaluate the spatial distribution of etofenprox drift in a vineyard-hedgerow system and its effect on the predatory mite Kampimodromus aberrans. Three scenarios of decreasing potential drift were compared, all in still wind conditions. In the worst case of free expansion of drift, 12% of the applied rate drifted for 6–7 m with minor effect on K. aberrans abundance, according to the dose–response assay results; the presence of a hedgerow reduced the drift by about 80%. The hedgerow was also effective when good agronomic practices were followed, and the effect of drift on K. aberrans was not significant, its abundance being mainly linked to the patchiness of the natural population. Because of lateral drift, i.e. not in the direction of air-flow from sprayer, spray was detected at very low concentration in the contiguous untreated vineyard. This had no effect on K. aberrans but had the capacity to contaminate organic crops and provide a risk to surface water and bystanders. This suggests that an environmental regulatory scheme taking hedgerows into account should be supported and implemented on a catchment or regional scale.",116,4,447,456,Pesticide; Spatial distribution; Sprayer; Etofenprox; Vineyard; Environmental science; Natural population growth; Agronomy; Field experiment; Abundance (ecology),,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1537511013001670 https://core.ac.uk/display/53500139,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2013.10.007,,10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2013.10.007,2045247791,,0,000-554-580-318-263; 007-861-527-195-916; 010-818-332-920-449; 012-322-338-631-625; 016-634-819-503-526; 023-815-611-572-73X; 024-414-614-749-026; 026-762-485-760-897; 029-433-936-125-211; 038-065-807-428-777; 039-352-553-006-029; 040-076-108-521-185; 041-091-851-993-367; 042-460-327-831-211; 043-213-251-246-857; 044-053-368-372-714; 046-117-070-832-020; 049-399-668-807-96X; 050-327-793-079-554; 053-456-403-000-004; 055-171-545-258-24X; 058-098-786-154-557; 064-820-313-273-081; 070-948-290-762-076; 071-359-339-566-350; 073-759-939-124-965; 076-400-418-834-804; 078-629-188-201-275; 079-783-247-553-29X; 083-625-672-314-565; 095-803-620-800-54X; 112-860-720-304-733; 119-594-926-925-223; 137-720-182-631-35X; 138-864-654-742-242; 149-840-427-947-494; 152-462-760-570-865; 165-321-215-085-517,10

R. Redding; B. Welten; M. Kear,"Summary; ; In intensive pastoral systems the landscape at ground level is clad in dense, filtering vegetation – yet phosphorus losses in overland flow do occur, and pollution of surface waters is a serious consequence. The use of pre-applied polyacrylamide (PAM) or chitosan to trap particulate phosphorus (PP) and P-sorbing potable water treatment alum residue (PWTR) to enhance vegetative filtering effects is examined here using field and laboratory overland flow simulation (flows from 0.43 to 0.34 litres s−1 (m width)−1) and analysis.; ; ; ; Fitted equations suggest that up to 40% of dissolved reactive P applied (0.75 mg P litre−1) in overland flow could be captured in a flow length of 2.1 m (1 kg PWTR m−2). Unfortunately, drying decreased PWTR effectiveness, though little of the P captured was readily desorbed. This effect did not appear to be the result of gibbsite formation. Compared with the other treatments, there was a strong treatment effect of pre-applied PAM on the change in PP losses (P < 0.001) over time, though evidence suggests the PAM effect declined during a 44 minute flow period.; ; ; ; We showed that the investigated two-pronged approach to the enhancement of the effectiveness of P trapping by pasture had limitations. Laboratory sheet-flow simulations suggest that a field-stable P sorber with sorption characteristics similar to those of the un-dried PWTR could be an effective retention enhancer for dissolved P. Pre-applied PAM can have an effect on particulate-P trapping but was rapidly dissolved and removed by flow.",59,2,257,264,Soil science; Chemistry; Water treatment; Particulates; Pasture; Polyacrylamide; Alum; Surface runoff; Pollution; Sorption,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2007.00990.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2007.00990.x/abstract https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/543591,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2007.00990.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2389.2007.00990.x,1973131322,,0,002-287-438-917-82X; 003-937-503-545-988; 004-776-763-469-995; 005-166-759-960-720; 008-380-052-396-94X; 013-169-740-193-422; 014-525-359-505-233; 014-852-717-923-231; 014-951-301-241-599; 015-306-132-148-477; 017-500-884-331-25X; 020-350-975-055-200; 024-437-464-624-317; 030-881-741-395-70X; 032-445-804-470-538; 033-881-668-870-349; 036-927-065-452-05X; 038-208-098-921-053; 062-021-824-447-385; 065-573-887-150-065; 065-597-401-419-447; 087-168-688-204-963; 099-455-680-623-845; 101-823-351-249-983; 102-307-069-255-349; 127-318-864-481-434; 150-015-545-690-891; 154-061-288-101-808,12

Rasmussen; Annette Baattrup-Pedersen; Peter Wiberg-Larsen; Ursula S. McKnight; Brian Kronvang,"Abstract According to the European Water Framework Directive, member states are obliged to ensure that all surface water bodies achieve at least good ecological status and to identify major anthropogenic stressors. Non-point source contamination of agricultural pesticides is widely acknowledged as one of the most important anthropogenic stressors in stream ecosystems. We surveyed the occurrence of 31 pesticides and evaluated their potential toxicity for benthic macroinvertebrates using Toxic Units (TU) in 14 Danish 1st-and 2nd-order streams in bed sediments and stream water during storm flow and base flow. Total pesticide concentrations and toxic potential were highest during storm flow events with maximum TU ranging from −6.63 to −1.72. We found that minimum buffer strip width in the near upstream area was the most important parameter governing TU. Furthermore, adding a function for minimum buffer strip width to the Runoff Potential (RP) model increased its power to predict measured TUs from 46% to 64%. However, including a function for tile drainage capacity is probably equally important and should be considered in future research in order to further optimise the RP model. Our results clearly emphasise the importance of considering buffer strips as risk mitigation tools in terms of non-point source pesticide contamination. We furthermore apply our results for discussing the minimum dimensions that vegetated buffer strips should have in order to sufficiently protect stream ecosystems from pesticide contamination and maintain good ecological status.",37,12,1990,1997,Contamination; Riparian zone; Tile drainage; Water Framework Directive; Hydrology; Environmental science; STREAMS; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Surface water; Environmental engineering,,,,,http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/44440404/Rasmussen_et_al._2011c.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857411002801 https://orbit.dtu.dk/files/127258914/Rasmussen_etal_EEJ_resubmission.pdf http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/127258914/Rasmussen_etal_EEJ_resubmission.pdf https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/buffer-strip-width-and-agricultural-pesticide-contamination-in-danish-lowland-streams-implications-for-stream-and-riparian-management(64a96ff5-7e93-42da-a716-5480be72bf9f).html https://core.ac.uk/download/13756419.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2011.08.016,,10.1016/j.ecoleng.2011.08.016,2140226917,,0,002-650-706-842-54X; 007-281-833-081-510; 008-459-696-654-141; 009-091-392-253-844; 010-499-008-581-398; 011-210-426-196-245; 011-878-331-339-485; 021-611-461-108-677; 024-556-636-186-088; 026-930-757-954-063; 031-104-867-080-80X; 033-957-740-001-235; 036-035-210-994-469; 036-391-976-244-654; 037-564-863-696-143; 040-583-389-619-969; 041-196-794-263-27X; 043-472-068-735-720; 052-872-691-991-928; 055-465-772-056-035; 057-703-038-933-033; 066-089-063-456-290; 070-686-985-257-87X; 071-271-955-460-81X; 072-662-573-392-553; 076-160-625-978-034; 078-927-735-353-813; 079-545-690-709-419; 083-971-752-530-892; 084-395-396-631-331; 086-496-072-727-834; 093-097-699-102-630; 107-662-603-610-936; 110-588-214-484-417; 120-522-014-726-902; 128-792-299-627-553; 129-494-335-321-203; 134-442-996-293-285; 151-835-526-022-740; 155-962-463-938-950; 167-477-900-820-966,69

Lower amounts of pesticides leached through grass-cover soil columns (2.7–24.3% of the initial amount) than the bare soil columns (8.0–55.1%), in correspondence with their sorption coefficients. Diuron was recovered in higher amounts in leachates (8.9–32.2%) than tebuconazole (2.7–12.9%), in agreement with their sorption coefficients. However, despite having a sorption coefficient similar to that of diuron, more procymidone was recovered in the leachates (10.2–55.1%), probably due to its facilitated transport by dissolved organic matter. Thus even in this very permeable soil, higher organic matter contents associated with grass-cover reduce the amount of pesticide leaching and limit the risk of groundwater contamination by the pesticides. The results of diuron and tebuconazole transfer through undisturbed buffer zone soil columns are in agreement with field observations on the buffer zone.",158,7,2446,2453,Environmental chemistry; Leaching (agriculture); Groundwater pollution; Dissolved organic carbon; Hydrology; Environmental science; Organic matter; Sorption; Soil contamination; Groundwater; Water pollution,,"Bridged Bicyclo Compounds/chemistry; Diuron/chemistry; Pesticides/chemistry; Poaceae; Soil/analysis; Triazoles/chemistry; Water/chemistry; Water Pollutants, Chemical/chemistry","Bridged Bicyclo Compounds; Pesticides; Soil; Triazoles; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water; tebuconazole; Diuron; procymidone",,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00584905/document https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103189178.html https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00584905 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026974911000134X http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026974911000134X https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20434821 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/20434821 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103189178,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2010.03.028,20434821,10.1016/j.envpol.2010.03.028,2081403603,,0,002-650-706-842-54X; 005-046-617-641-306; 005-585-530-503-798; 017-397-083-522-184; 017-964-751-911-758; 025-700-193-983-028; 028-115-267-265-558; 032-701-583-661-911; 033-443-964-883-259; 042-230-387-909-769; 044-053-092-886-254; 046-446-501-703-050; 046-883-335-088-210; 051-851-638-777-86X; 054-857-994-017-150; 056-470-147-718-374; 057-703-038-933-033; 064-067-768-999-666; 065-427-966-967-115; 072-053-332-217-590; 076-826-572-086-275; 078-927-735-353-813; 080-894-085-139-156; 082-425-030-497-387; 083-971-752-530-892; 085-432-820-988-206; 086-496-072-727-834; 094-049-137-663-313; 095-548-579-063-991; 111-288-588-656-115; 117-074-543-175-080; 121-639-988-742-420; 126-299-270-436-735; 133-363-147-232-814; 144-806-415-704-267; 146-670-572-557-590; 166-777-140-227-737; 178-140-173-536-98X; 181-000-667-326-695; 187-118-162-708-884; 190-653-022-688-36X; 194-158-767-830-671; 197-154-241-626-829,29

Thomson; Ary A. Hoffmann,"Natural invertebrate enemies on farmland may respond to local vegetation adjacent to the farmland. This can encourage individual landholders to maintain vegetation even when there are costs in terms of a reduction in crop area as well as maintenance of the vegetation. Here we investigated abundance of natural enemies in 61 vineyards from south eastern Australia, with either adjacent woody vegetation consisting of remnant native forests or wooded margins planted after establishment of the crop, or lacking in adjacent vegetation. Invertebrates were sampled five times at monthly intervals using canopy sticky traps. There was an increase in abundance of different groups of natural enemies when woody vegetation was present although these increases depended on size. Small natural enemies tended to be influenced by local features, whereas larger potentially more mobile groups were not affected. Predation of eggs of a vineyard insect pest, Epiphyas postvittana, was relatively higher in vineyards with either adjacent remnant forest or planted woody vegetation. Various types of local vegetation may therefore encourage a range of predators and parasitoids, increasing predation and control of a common vineyard pest.",52,2,160,166,Canopy; Biodiversity; Windbreak; Predation; Ecology; PEST analysis; Vegetation (pathology); Vineyard; Pest control; Agroforestry; Biology,,,,,https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND44302671 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103065177.html http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049964409002643 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049964409002643 https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/318151-natural-enemy-responses-and-pest-control--importance-of-local-vegetation https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103065177,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2009.10.008,,10.1016/j.biocontrol.2009.10.008,2078012639,,0,004-916-984-876-81X; 005-385-039-748-588; 006-126-944-893-638; 007-765-178-659-478; 007-830-817-540-712; 011-508-246-956-659; 014-155-943-674-866; 014-351-608-795-351; 014-354-635-481-220; 015-588-813-571-391; 016-833-602-863-485; 017-516-181-294-137; 018-857-795-660-025; 020-367-778-924-930; 021-745-808-312-903; 026-735-761-517-671; 031-114-644-626-51X; 031-649-251-196-994; 031-715-316-035-351; 032-085-397-277-741; 032-787-309-112-899; 035-242-779-348-096; 041-694-076-200-620; 041-947-413-095-773; 042-303-914-852-499; 047-367-958-846-378; 049-309-154-725-404; 050-564-969-541-343; 056-892-630-404-500; 057-420-111-160-322; 059-740-223-733-856; 060-349-780-487-794; 068-730-938-041-13X; 069-901-245-663-534; 070-194-102-378-889; 074-701-665-243-397; 077-532-222-012-842; 085-961-686-904-115; 086-096-752-108-057; 088-009-289-379-908; 095-802-994-684-438; 102-726-931-556-404; 103-400-531-806-909; 107-575-706-718-020; 114-385-239-299-862; 118-409-347-010-789; 135-037-129-592-479; 137-637-923-794-571; 141-780-299-295-803; 148-203-562-421-657; 166-248-084-772-47X; 173-672-791-935-14X; 176-438-790-085-693; 186-717-087-292-097,68

The regression model predicts tree wet weight based upon circumference at breast-height (137 cm) with an r-square value of 0.9922. Carbon storage in above-ground biomass is estimated to be 3.57 to 3.71 metric tons per hectare, with a measured annual increment of 0.92 to 1.37 metric ton per hectare per year. The variability of carbon storage within this biological system, including soil organic matter, is explored, and the number of samples required to achieve a desired level of statistical certainty are predicted. As has been investigated previously for other biological systems (Garten and Wullschleger, 1999), the study shows that a prohibitively large number of samples must be taken in order to achieve high degrees of certainty about mean carbon storage values. The study also shows, however, that mean values with somewhat greater uncertainties can easily be achieved with much smaller sample sizes. Thus carbon sequestration verification might be accomplished cost-effectively if the degree of certainty required is not unrealistically high for highly variable natural systems.",102,1-3,375,388,,,"Carbon/analysis; Environmental Monitoring/methods; Greenhouse Effect; Iowa; Models, Theoretical; Populus/growth & development; Rivers; Sample Size; Soil/analysis; Uncertainty",Soil; Carbon,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-005-6393-8,15869197,10.1007/s10661-005-6393-8,,,0,022-582-828-625-600; 024-555-323-629-816; 052-982-715-371-625; 054-769-809-715-919; 063-697-141-689-04X; 078-948-075-960-847; 110-189-439-861-756; 118-244-426-247-474,1

Dabney; K.C. McGregor; Glenn V. Wilson; R. F. Cullum,"Grass hedges are specialized vegetative buffers effective in trapping sediment. Information is needed on how the effectiveness of grass hedges changes over time after planting, and in response to hedge clipping management. Erosion from natural rainfall was measured during 13 yr after establishing single-row (eventually growing to be 1 m wide) miscanthus (Miscanthus sinensis Andersson) hedges at the lower end of erosion plots (21 m long, 5% slope) in a replicated study involving conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) grown on silt loam soils (Typic Fragiudalfs) in Holly Springs, MS. Sediment yield values from plots with and without grass hedges were analyzed with reference to the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to determine the conservation support practice (""P"" factor) for sediment yield, which is the fractional reduction in sediment yield due to the presence of the grass hedge. The ""P"" factor of grass hedges was found to be about 0.5 in the establishment year and to decrease progressively with time for CT cotton. The ""P"" factor for grass hedges averaged 0.23 for CT wide-row cotton and 0.12 for ultra narrow row (UNR) cotton studied with older hedges. ""P"" factors for NT were higher, averaging 0.5 for wide-row cotton and 0.65 for UNR cotton, perhaps reflecting a finer eroded sediment size distribution. Comparison of several methods of estimating hedge effectiveness showed that while observed monthly rainfall effects on soil erosion were not fully explained by the E130 term used in RUSLE, fitting more complex statistical models to the data did not appreciably alter estimates of fractional sediment yield reduction due to grass hedges. The results of this study demonstrated that during extreme events, hedge effectiveness was enhanced (""P"" was lowered) by management that allowed accumulation of hedge clippings upslope of the hedges. However, for freshly tilled conditions, ""P"" values for 7-yr old hedges varied from 0.2 for monthly rainfall = 100 mm to 0.35 for monthly rainfall = 400 mm even when all residues were removed.",73,1,241,254,Loam; Erosion; Tillage; Universal Soil Loss Equation; Miscanthus sinensis; Miscanthus; Conventional tillage; Erosion control; Environmental science; Agronomy,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009SSASJ..73..241D/abstract https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/23525 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj2007.0434 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20093094513.html https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093094513 https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/sssaj/pdfs/73/1/241,http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2007.0434,,10.2136/sssaj2007.0434,2002228759,,0,012-133-504-974-402; 013-493-765-427-63X; 025-795-506-089-145; 027-561-603-892-491; 031-785-576-326-845; 033-890-182-096-159; 051-402-511-190-857; 055-873-833-854-552; 057-131-240-501-938; 069-829-193-331-373; 086-213-236-252-052; 086-278-743-531-248; 086-812-760-777-597; 087-680-309-241-290; 090-010-509-001-115; 091-732-902-117-254; 093-531-131-371-52X; 096-833-566-535-725; 102-299-231-485-20X; 105-484-476-935-241; 109-059-758-860-434; 109-953-506-304-374; 122-493-899-982-569; 130-418-545-726-605; 132-949-723-939-343; 135-138-272-402-482; 141-097-069-585-841; 141-616-290-765-640; 145-628-223-693-935; 164-702-330-976-043; 174-198-961-372-433; 180-933-688-320-792; 192-341-972-259-42X; 198-427-699-712-670,20

The objective of this study was to estimate the effects of conservation practices on hydraulic properties and root-zone water dynamics of the soil. A 3-year experiment was performed on a slope at Xianning. Four treatments were evaluated for their ability to reduce soil erosion and improve soil water conditions. Compared with no practices (CK) and living grass strips (GS), the application of polyacrylamide (PAM) significantly reduced soil crust formation during intense rainfall, whereas rice straw mulching (SM) completely abolished soil crust formation. The SM and PAM treatments improved soil water-stable aggregates, with a redistribution of micro-aggregates into macro-aggregates. PAM and SM significantly increased the soil water-holding capacity. These practices mitigated the degradation of the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) during intense rainfalls. These methods increased soil water storage but with limited effects during heavy rainfalls in the wet period. In contrast, during the dry period, SM had the highest soil water storage, followed by PAM and CK. Grass strips had the lowest soil water storage because of the water uptake during the vigorous grass growth. A slight decline in the soil moisture resulted in a significant decrease in the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (Ku) of the topsoil. Therefore, the hydraulic conductivity in the field is governed by soil moisture, and the remaining soil moisture is more important than improving soil properties to resist short-term droughts. As a result, SM is the most effective management practice when compared with PAM and GS, although they all protect the soil hydraulic properties during wet periods. These results suggest that mulching is the best strategy for water management in erosion-threatened and drought-threatened red soils.

B. Hairsine; David J. Tongway,"Restoring belts of perennial vegetation in landscapes is widely recognized as a measure of improving landscape function. While there have been many studies of the transport of pollutants through grass filter strips, few have addressed sediment related processes through restored tree belts. In order to identify these processes and quantify their relative contribution to sediment trapping, a series of rainfall simulations was conducted on a 600 m2 hillslope comprising a pasture upslope of a 15 year old tree belt. Although the simulated events were extreme (average recurrence intervals ∼10 and 50 yr), the trapping efficiency of the tree belt was very high: at least 94% of the total mass of sediments was captured. All the size fractions were trapped with a minimum Sediment Trapping Ratio (STR) of 91% for the medium-sized fragments. Fractions 182 µm were totally captured (STR = 100%). Through the joint analysis of sediment budgets and soil surface conditions, we identified different trapping processes. The main trapping process is the sedimentation (at least 62% of trapped sediment mass) with deposits in the backwater and as micro-terraces within the tree belt. Modelling results show that the coarsest size fractions above 75 µm are preferentially deposited. Joint infiltration of water and sediments has also been noticed, however, this process alone cannot explain the selective trapping of the finest fractions. We suggest that the finest fractions transported by the overland flow may be trapped by adsorption on the abundant litter present within the tree belt.

Moore; Margaret A. Palmer,"The urbanization of agricultural lands is currently one of the dominant pat- terns of land use change in developed countries. In the United States and parts of Europe, this has led to the implementation of agricultural land preservation programs and riparian protection and replanting efforts along urban streams. The ecological benefits of such programs for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity have yet to be fully explored. We designed a study to investigate the patterns of stream macroinvertebrate community structure along a gradient of agriculture to urban development, and the patterns among urban streams that vary in the amount of intact riparian buffer. In 2001 and 2002, we sampled the 29 small headwater streams comprising the outlying tributaries of four watersheds just north of Washington, D.C., in Montgomery County, Maryland, USA. This region has had dramatic urban development over the last 50 years, yet significant efforts have been made to maintain riparian buffers and promote preservation of agricultural land. Macroinvertebrate richness was strongly related to land use, with agricultural streams exhibiting the highest macroinvertebrate diversity. Taxa richness was related negatively and linearly (no statistical threshold) to the amount of impervious surface cover. For the urban streams, there was a strong positive relationship between invertebrate diversity and riparian forest cover. Urban streams with high amounts of intact riparian forest exhibited biodiversity levels more comparable to less urban areas despite high amounts of impervious cover in their catchments. The agricultural headwater streams in this study were not only more diverse than the urban headwaters, but their levels of macroinvertebrate diversity were high compared to other published estimates for agricultural streams. These higher richness values may be due to widespread use of ''best management practices'' (BMPs), including no-till farming and the implementation of woody and herbaceous riparian buffers, which may alleviate many acute stressors caused by cultivation. These findings suggest that, if managed properly, the preservation of agricultural land from development may help conserve stream invertebrate biodiversity, and that maintenance of riparian forests even in highly urbanized watersheds may help alleviate ecological disturbances that might otherwise limit macroinvertebrate survival.",15,4,1169,1177,"Riparian zone; Land use, land-use change and forestry; Riparian forest; Ecology; Geography; Impervious surface; Riparian buffer; Urbanization; Land use; Agricultural land",,,,,https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/04-1484 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/04-1484 https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/04-1484 http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/04-1484 http://rydberg.biology.colostate.edu/bz471/readings/MoorePalmer.pdf https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/04-1484 https://www.jstor.org/stable/info/4543427 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/04-1484/full https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/04-1484 http://palmerlab.umd.edu/Publications/Moore%20and%20Palmer%202005_Ecol%20Apps.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/04-1484,,10.1890/04-1484,2052456679,,0,002-239-487-029-857; 006-702-846-072-871; 008-099-347-320-673; 009-550-017-598-234; 009-624-150-525-172; 013-670-874-554-915; 016-407-249-009-242; 019-065-946-135-668; 019-089-565-313-48X; 037-192-364-418-275; 037-784-019-629-927; 042-936-884-620-039; 046-626-408-470-449; 047-924-585-963-094; 055-475-878-207-54X; 057-191-112-701-980; 059-726-124-598-491; 061-647-605-955-134; 064-155-340-699-777; 065-524-766-334-22X; 077-806-418-364-116; 077-853-550-551-113; 078-241-800-893-458; 082-716-873-973-679; 084-737-607-904-270; 092-778-984-444-098; 093-051-584-612-100; 096-769-301-440-794; 098-004-631-148-428; 111-407-646-226-631; 115-304-531-279-534; 117-343-019-994-955; 120-212-843-531-658; 155-134-656-519-45X; 158-695-500-320-945; 176-559-157-173-808; 178-020-666-486-363; 183-461-881-469-552; 192-561-281-096-267,262
068-177-504-053-714,Local and broadscale landscape structure differentially impact predation of two potato pests.,,2010,journal article,Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America,10510761; 19395582,Wiley-Blackwell,United States,Ben P. Werling; Claudio Gratton,"Agricultural habitats are the recipients of ecosystem services provided by mobile arthropods like pollinators and natural enemies. These organisms can disperse between non-crop habitats and crops and can benefit from resources in non-crop areas. Thus, it may be important to conserve non-crop habitats to maintain ecosystem services within crops. However, even single ecosystem services, such as pollination or predation of pests, may be provided by a complex of species. Different species may respond to landscape structure at differing spatial scales. This raises the question: What scales should conservation take place at to sustain an ecosystem service? Here, we examine variation in predation of two potato pests in response to landscape structure. Specifically, predation of Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, and green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, were quantified in potato and field-margin habitats set in landscapes that varied at different scales. At a local scale (meters), potato fields of different sizes were bordered by different areas of grassy field margin. At a broad scale (kilometers), these habitats were set in landscapes composed of varying percentages of non-crop habitat. Predation of both pests was associated with landscape structure, but this relationship occurred at different scales for each pest and interacted differently with habitat type. Predation of L. decemlineata eggs was greater in field margins than in the potato crop and increased in both habitats when field margins were large relative to potatoes. In contrast, aphid predation in field margins increased with the area of non-crop habitat within 1.5 km, but did not change in adjacent potato. These data emphasize that, even a single ecosystem service, such as predation of pests, can be influenced by landscape structure at multiple scales. More generally, it may be necessary to conserve heterogeneity both at local scales (individual farm fields) and broad scales (entire mosaic landscapes) to maintain ecosystem services. This may be especially true for ecosystem services that are the aggregate result of the actions of many species or ecological processes.",20,4,1114,1125,Spatial ecology; Pollination; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Myzus persicae; Colorado potato beetle; Agroforestry; Ecosystem services; Biology; Landscape ecology,,Animals; Aphids; Coleoptera; Ecosystem; Geography; Ovum; Predatory Behavior; Solanum tuberosum/parasitology; Wisconsin,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20597294 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103194995.html https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103194995 https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/09-0597.1 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/09-0597.1 http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/09-0597.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/09-0597.1,20597294,10.1890/09-0597.1,2161337972,,0,006-125-560-814-537; 008-225-619-668-580; 011-508-246-956-659; 012-267-243-122-028; 016-204-638-673-374; 022-070-333-305-083; 022-971-044-628-458; 025-236-982-321-426; 025-775-649-567-265; 028-813-820-317-500; 031-114-644-626-51X; 031-753-110-724-693; 034-333-107-858-752; 035-138-891-064-544; 038-813-504-444-973; 047-815-644-815-225; 048-643-223-219-634; 051-439-833-190-234; 056-892-630-404-500; 058-842-420-793-015; 062-036-445-726-722; 071-421-956-719-046; 074-300-449-042-315; 077-532-222-012-842; 082-858-046-996-889; 084-387-070-806-39X; 086-730-179-525-725; 087-186-786-234-321; 087-520-578-895-249; 088-921-085-034-823; 089-820-647-773-411; 094-542-264-880-862; 104-041-676-491-551; 109-691-661-850-685; 111-528-391-156-029; 117-319-504-327-830; 121-113-313-406-625; 127-747-168-852-33X; 133-252-955-828-163; 148-203-562-421-657; 176-438-790-085-693; 184-170-583-035-963,39

Burchell; Garry L. Grabow; Deanna L. Osmond; Tiffany L. Messer,"Riparian buffers have been used for many years as a best management practice to decrease the effects of nonpoint pollution from watersheds. The NC Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (NC CREP) has established buffers to treat groundwater nitrate-nitrogen (NO3−-N) from agricultural sources in multiple river basins. A maturing 46 m wide riparian buffer enrolled in NC CREP was studied to determine its effectiveness in reducing groundwater NO3−-N concentrations from a cattle pasture fertilized with poultry litter. Three monitoring blocks that included groundwater quality wells, water table wells, and soil redox probes, were established in the buffer. NO3−-N concentrations decreased significantly across the buffer in all of the monitoring blocks with mean reductions of 76-92%. Many biological processes, including denitrification and plant uptake, may have been responsible for the observed NO3−-N reductions but could not be differentiated in this study. However, mean reductions in Cl− concentrations ranged from 48-65% through the blocks, which indicated that dilution was an important factor in observed NO3−-N reductions. These findings should be carefully considered for future buffer enrollments when assigning nitrogen removal credits.",50,3,653,664,Riparian zone; Nonpoint source pollution; Nitrate; Riparian buffer; Poultry litter; Hydrology; Environmental science; Water table; Denitrification; Groundwater; Environmental engineering,,,,NC Department of Environment and Natural Resources-Division of Soil and Water Conservation; NC Clean Water Management Trust; NC Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014JAWRA..50..653W/abstract https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jawr.12209,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jawr.12209,,10.1111/jawr.12209,2062112525,,0,000-805-507-747-663; 001-469-701-101-555; 006-017-352-131-346; 006-961-058-962-861; 007-751-667-195-881; 013-565-979-255-044; 017-086-649-940-521; 019-385-843-000-851; 020-188-845-767-450; 029-294-447-653-235; 032-333-797-435-104; 033-418-655-488-357; 034-345-383-966-539; 035-485-421-334-091; 036-902-926-859-169; 038-088-874-218-042; 039-727-496-126-339; 041-559-307-895-617; 044-948-727-495-773; 045-196-699-064-833; 047-857-691-947-082; 058-218-489-015-546; 059-517-397-699-529; 072-270-293-804-645; 073-703-019-282-474; 075-002-005-590-557; 076-723-788-807-80X; 083-692-916-137-156; 099-518-256-255-268; 100-845-850-323-114; 103-989-366-241-549; 111-064-941-380-808; 116-886-192-455-802; 121-071-106-816-020; 125-887-505-418-414; 132-271-028-136-606; 132-435-645-019-657; 136-921-898-285-602; 139-816-438-367-88X; 164-350-768-837-199; 168-847-762-222-061; 196-381-785-440-137,5

Dively; Douglas E. Gill; Charles A. Rewa,"ABSTRACT Filter strips are strips of herbaceous vegetation planted along agricultural field margins adjacent to streams or wetlands and are designed to intercept sediment, nutrients, and agrichemicals. Roughly 16,000 ha of filter strips have been established in Maryland through the United States Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program. Filter strips often represent the only uncultivated herbaceous areas on farmland in Maryland and therefore may be important habitat for early-successional bird species. Most filter strips in Maryland are planted to either native warm-season grasses or cool-season grasses and range in width from 10.7 m to 91.4 m. From 2004 to 2007 we studied the breeding and wintering bird communities in filter strips adjacent to wooded edges and non-buffered field edges and the effect that grass type and width of filter strips had on bird community composition. We used 5 bird community metrics (total bird density, species richness, scrub-shrub bird density, gras...",75,1,116,125,Vegetation; Habitat; Ecology; Range (biology); Filter strip; Herbaceous plant; Hydrology; Environmental science; STREAMS; Species richness; Wetland,,,,,https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-wildlife-management/volume-75/issue-1/jwmg.3/Bird-Community-Response-to-Filter-Strips-in-Maryland/10.1002/jwmg.3.full https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jwmg.3 https://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1002/jwmg.3 https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70034067 https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jwmg.3 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jwmg.3/abstract https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-wildlife-management/volume-75/issue-1/jwmg.3/Bird-Community-Response-to-Filter-Strips-in-Maryland/10.1002/jwmg.3.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.3,,10.1002/jwmg.3,2032064635,,0,000-281-554-875-962; 000-587-003-041-373; 001-429-343-923-981; 003-510-625-031-181; 006-077-939-585-253; 015-373-969-372-614; 021-933-813-475-043; 023-786-318-688-047; 026-609-010-582-360; 026-740-992-753-205; 027-139-059-151-089; 027-356-962-068-696; 035-581-751-895-887; 037-574-041-312-656; 043-900-591-870-482; 051-295-715-858-862; 061-851-132-853-223; 065-890-360-780-473; 076-659-710-271-132; 079-261-909-912-581; 089-432-459-576-010; 104-784-237-651-91X; 107-258-912-245-333; 115-123-313-615-824; 115-611-647-492-038; 122-155-307-034-978; 128-222-836-109-002; 139-914-557-884-686; 162-932-673-062-383; 173-117-656-524-396; 195-618-519-387-640,16

For conservation planning the knowledge of overall effectiveness and its seasonal variation is highly relevant. Our objectives were to (i) evaluate the seasonal variation in runoff reduction and sediment trapping in a GWW, (ii) identify the driving parameters and (iii) measure and analyse the seasonal variation of each of these parameters. Runoff and sediment delivery were measured between 1994 and 2001 in two paired subwatersheds, both optimised to reduce runoff and sediment delivery by an intensive soil conservation system within the fields. In one of the subwatersheds additionally a GWW (290 m long, 37 m wide) was established to further improve soil and water conservation. During the observation period it reduced runoff and sediment delivery by 87 and 93%, respectively. 70% of total outflow and 68% of total sediment output occurred between February and April, mainly controlled by watershed hydrology. Seasonal changes in GWW properties, namely soil water content and hydraulic roughness, had a minor effect. It was most notably in May and June, when available field capacity averaged 59% while inflow was dominated by single heavy rain events (15% of total inflow). In general, the results indicate the high potential of GWWs for reducing runoff and sediment delivery, especially if combined with an intensive soil and water conservation system in the draining fields. For conservation planning, the least effectiveness at the end of winter should be taken into account.",87,1,48,58,Soil conservation; Runoff curve number; WEPP; Soil water; Grassed waterway; Field capacity; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016719870500098X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2005.02.035,,10.1016/j.still.2005.02.035,2013000285,,0,001-262-702-475-585; 002-916-363-298-786; 003-728-899-949-75X; 008-246-020-979-051; 010-986-832-547-110; 014-082-686-261-694; 018-885-734-779-223; 019-293-917-776-188; 024-811-052-471-550; 026-992-482-224-099; 027-988-435-399-704; 029-681-274-360-310; 040-507-938-290-621; 042-036-288-239-561; 044-401-317-828-273; 045-514-180-097-787; 050-198-618-361-634; 052-037-025-646-402; 057-603-249-735-303; 062-158-704-164-476; 065-427-966-967-115; 065-672-467-427-885; 067-301-094-755-543; 068-049-448-216-534; 078-889-242-065-974; 083-431-696-176-966; 086-812-760-777-597; 093-807-963-624-926; 096-145-122-087-467; 106-284-569-265-355; 109-207-190-837-590; 111-288-588-656-115; 117-342-446-985-725; 117-346-312-542-660; 119-211-912-940-114; 130-940-780-158-38X; 131-532-176-733-767; 151-498-245-092-772; 160-087-225-408-274; 160-908-927-999-238; 170-591-128-283-41X; 182-906-730-748-020; 184-120-604-176-760; 192-709-769-110-550,47

Pywell; Katy L. James; I. Herbert; W. R. Meek; Claire Carvell; D. Bell; Tim H. Sparks,"The provision of overwintering refuges has important implications for both conservation of invertebrate biodiversity on farmland and biological control of crop pests. In this study we carried out a systematic investigation of the effects of habitat type and age on the quality of overwintering refuges for Coleoptera and Araneae on an arable farm in the UK. Hedgerow habitats contained taller and more diverse vegetation with a greater proportion of bare ground compared with field margins. Vegetation height and diversity, and the richness and cover of forbs all increased significantly with habitat age. Soil organic matter content also increased with habitat age, suggesting a more favourable structure for burrowing Coleoptera. Total abundance and richness of Coleoptera and Araneae were significantly higher in hedgerow habitats compared with the field margins. This largely reflected the response of staphylinid beetles, the most abundant group recorded. There was no effect of habitat age on overall abundance or diversity, suggesting the good dispersal ability of many farmland invertebrates, but also reflecting the close relationship between habitat age and type. The response of individual invertebrate species was more mixed: 10 species were recorded in significantly higher densities in the hedge base compared with one in the field margin. Similarly, eight species were recorded in significantly higher densities in mature habitats compared with four in recently established vegetation. There were significant interactions between habitat type and age for six species, of which four showed a marked preference for the base of mature hedgerows. These included both important predators of cereal aphids and crop pests. It was concluded that hedgerows provided the highest quality overwintering habitat for invertebrates emphasising the importance of strategies directed at conserving and enhancing this habitat. However, newly created field margins fulfilled a useful role in rapidly providing overwintering refuges for a more limited group of invertebrate species.",123,1,79,90,Biodiversity; Vegetation; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Overwintering; Biological dispersal; Species richness; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320704004306,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2004.10.010,,10.1016/j.biocon.2004.10.010,2076625995,,0,002-840-565-989-288; 003-815-496-301-575; 006-128-603-266-491; 008-608-775-518-291; 012-946-770-797-62X; 014-396-882-188-748; 014-571-735-949-397; 015-578-334-267-852; 016-476-220-285-090; 016-823-705-101-257; 022-070-333-305-083; 029-264-530-643-997; 030-652-847-337-20X; 037-241-390-682-529; 043-498-137-571-498; 048-888-393-075-616; 050-907-802-597-89X; 051-103-549-479-234; 052-363-993-930-092; 055-107-013-670-19X; 056-585-869-238-25X; 056-892-041-411-85X; 057-612-922-967-628; 058-105-561-757-413; 064-975-099-130-640; 076-729-975-056-738; 084-744-111-694-770; 087-186-786-234-321; 090-924-501-333-474; 093-275-781-286-407; 097-095-789-567-42X; 102-378-349-003-574; 103-540-661-878-884; 104-402-912-397-497; 109-691-661-850-685; 111-528-391-156-029; 122-593-714-312-795; 126-812-080-751-085; 132-775-784-488-585; 133-200-005-136-011; 137-942-105-992-390; 141-759-936-693-745; 142-547-556-180-595; 145-653-851-729-665; 183-044-272-459-669,89

Zaimes; Richard C. Schultz,"Abstract Extensive land-use changes in Iowa have increased erosional processes and the amount of fines deposited on stream beds. Large amounts of fines cover the other bed substrate that are essential habitat for invertebrates and fish. In Iowa and other agricultural Midwestern states, riparian conservation land-uses are being established to minimize sediment inputs to streams. This study compared stream bed substrate composition in reaches adjacent to: riparian forest buffers, grass filters, row-cropped fields, pastures with cattle fenced out of the stream and continuous, rotational and intensively grazed rotational pastures, in three regions of Iowa. The objective was to examine the impacts of the adjacent riparian land-uses on stream bed substrate composition. The percentages of fines in this study ranged from: 36 to 63% in the central region; 10 to 31% in the northeast region; and 22 to 85% in the southeast region. The high percentage of fines in most stream bed reaches indicates high embeddedness. The high embeddedness resulted in the few significant differences in substrate percentages among riparian land-uses. Decades of agricultural land-uses have heavily impacted stream beds and only significant reductions in surface and bank erosion at the watershed scale can begin to reverse this trend. There were indications that riparian forest buffers and to a lesser degree, pastures with cattle fenced out of the stream, could decrease fines resulting in a more diverse substrate composition. Overall, more targeted approaches for the establishment of conservation land-uses in combination with other restoration practices (e.g. in-stream enhancements) are required to successfully decrease fines on stream beds.",37,11,1692,1699,Riparian zone; Riparian forest; Nonpoint source pollution; Stream bed; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; STREAMS; Bank erosion; Substrate (marine biology),,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925857411002163 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857411002163,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2011.06.029,,10.1016/j.ecoleng.2011.06.029,2045507585,,0,000-223-840-816-650; 005-450-304-713-561; 007-720-927-435-57X; 007-868-997-910-082; 013-749-549-140-155; 016-053-060-230-167; 016-117-860-166-511; 019-744-631-826-397; 026-652-453-307-433; 028-802-252-344-012; 029-881-859-708-067; 032-514-448-851-196; 033-086-749-213-444; 034-604-990-201-021; 035-932-429-406-08X; 038-335-400-539-341; 040-520-882-050-376; 045-814-903-083-739; 050-366-710-095-113; 053-181-881-442-026; 054-766-321-214-033; 057-727-962-585-077; 060-656-316-784-998; 066-766-519-764-554; 068-015-328-485-638; 076-535-469-487-214; 078-395-809-984-737; 079-196-971-304-319; 083-579-568-766-997; 083-619-701-060-090; 088-547-265-212-941; 097-346-718-682-010; 097-728-085-931-913; 104-022-771-306-955; 106-420-178-731-885; 115-642-860-718-878; 116-694-649-287-604; 120-522-014-726-902; 132-380-946-851-855; 140-522-987-059-830; 142-104-568-001-483; 148-675-523-413-377; 154-978-657-665-321; 166-952-622-390-540; 168-467-792-986-447; 178-590-389-427-609; 191-359-559-824-869; 194-917-923-184-160,10

Tomer; Thomas B. Moorman; John L. Kovar; David James; Michael R. Burkart,"ABSTRACT: Riparian buffers prevent sediment and phosphorus (P) from reaching streams but their accumulation in buffers is seldom measured. This study9s objectives were to determine accumulations of sediment and phosphorus in a multi-species riparian buffer and characterize spatial-temporal patterns of phosphorus in soil water and groundwater. The buffer was planted in 2000, below a steep-sloping field in row-crop production under no-tillage management in Iowa9s Loess Hills. Topographic surveys were conducted in 2002, after the buffer was fully established, and again in 2005. Mapped differences in elevation showed sediment accretion was associated with concentrated flow pathways and lateral flow along the buffer-crop margin. About 32% of the buffer9s outer switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) zone had sediment accumulations exceeding 4 cm (1.6 in), which totaled 14.5 Mg ha−1 (over three years) contributing area, or 4.8 Mg ha−1 yr−1 (2.1 t ac−1 yr−1). Among five soil plots, total phosphorus in accreted sediment varied from 7 to 55 g m−2 (0.02 to 0.18 oz ft−2) totaling 9.6 kg P ha−1 (8.5 lb P ac−1) contributing area. Phosphorus concentrations in soil water were greatest beneath the switchgrass, compared to the crop and the buffer9s inner vegetation zones (p",62,5,329,338,Riparian zone; Soil water; Riparian buffer; Buffer zone; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Phosphorus; Groundwater,,,,,http://www.jswconline.org/content/62/5/329.abstract https://www.jswconline.org/content/62/5/329,https://www.jswconline.org/content/62/5/329,,,2337724336,,0,,25

Hirsh; Catherine M. Mabry; Lisa A. Schulte; Matt Liebman,"Crop production and prevailing farming practices have greatly reduced biodiversity and nearly eliminated native prairie in the central USA. Restoring small areas of prairie on cropland may increase plant biodiversity and native species abundance while benefiting the cropland. In Iowa, we incorporated buffer strips composed of prairie vegetation within catchments (0.5 ha to 3.2 ha land areas in which precipitation drained to a collection point at the slope bottom) used for corn ( Zea mays ) and soybean ( Glycine max ) production. We planted prairie buffer strips in three designs, varying the proportion of the catchment converted to buffer and/or the continuity of the buffer. Within the catchments, we determined the identity and percent cover of buffer strip plant species during 2008–2011 and of weed species in cropped areas during 2009–2011. We found 380% more species in 6 m2 of buffer strip than in 6 m2 of crop, indicating that the presence of buffer strips greatly increased catchment diversity. Plant community composition did not differ among the three buffer designs. Despite being surrounded by cropland, the buffer vegetation was dominated by native perennial species—the targeted vegetation type for both ecohydrological functions (e.g., erosion control) and native species conservation—within four years of establishment. Furthermore, weed species richness and prevalence did not differ between cropped areas of catchments with buffer strips and cropped areas of catchments without buffer strips. These results indicate that converting 10–20% of cropland to prairie buffer strips successfully reintroduced perennial species characteristic of native prairie without increasing weeds in adjacent crops.",31,2,201,211,Biodiversity; Vegetation; Introduced species; Weed; Vegetation type; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Plant community; Species richness; Agronomy,,,,,https://works.bepress.com/catherine_mcmullen/3/ https://core.ac.uk/display/38936582 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/nrem_pubs/19/ http://er.uwpress.org/lookup/doi/10.3368/er.31.2.201 http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=nrem_pubs https://core.ac.uk/download/38936582.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3368/er.31.2.201,,10.3368/er.31.2.201,2172290001,,0,005-952-594-170-285; 009-256-582-324-853; 012-199-787-995-212; 012-335-108-074-344; 013-738-740-075-669; 014-806-611-940-810; 016-539-777-323-264; 019-622-915-734-27X; 020-476-610-145-290; 030-682-084-703-597; 031-008-219-011-195; 042-985-809-167-140; 043-890-816-980-193; 047-946-954-821-823; 050-948-394-739-14X; 052-987-325-921-233; 055-192-571-710-917; 056-220-117-383-292; 056-789-845-462-569; 057-001-477-328-971; 063-264-822-040-939; 065-932-639-593-926; 065-991-375-311-576; 075-182-328-430-399; 077-918-560-780-184; 083-412-860-749-866; 084-891-002-434-443; 095-104-916-898-838; 095-406-264-460-323; 099-050-643-792-089; 101-827-732-397-910; 102-741-113-454-268; 103-150-198-998-177; 105-209-607-529-360; 117-261-100-155-914; 122-044-701-879-491; 140-372-681-864-027; 145-068-815-411-652; 157-942-865-502-660; 160-814-066-258-368; 161-072-580-272-396; 165-977-277-915-055,22

University of Missouri--Columbia 2011.""December 2011""Understanding sorption and transport of veterinary antibiotics (VAs) is important for assessing the risk of VAs reaching water resources. Vegetative buffer strips (VBS) may be a useful tool for mitigating veterinary antibiotic transport from agricultural lands. Sorption experiment results showed that oxytetracycline (OTC) was strongly adsorbed and not readily extractable, while sulfadimethoxine (SDT) and sulfamethazine (SMZ) were highly mobile in soil. For all the antibiotics studied, VBS soils had higher sorption capacity than cropland soils. Linear regression analyses indicate that clay content and pH were the most important soil properties controlling OTC and SDT adsorption, respectively. For SMZ, organic carbon content, pH, initial SMZ concentration, and clay content were the most important factors controlling sorption. Dissolved organic matter had a slight negative effect on SMZ sorption. Transport experiments of SMZ were conducted in glass columns repacked with agroforestry and cropland soils. Computer modeling using HYDRUS-1D software indicated that a three-site model containing two reversible sites and one irreversible site coupled with the Freundlich sorption component best describes SMZ transport through the columns. Data from equilibrium sorption experiments and column transport experiments suggest that the AGF soil has a larger capacity to retain SMZ than the cropland soil. Overall, this research facilitates our understanding of VA sorption and transport in the environment and supports the use of vegetative buffers to mitigate VA loss from agroecosystems.Includes bibliographical reference",,,,,Buffer (optical fiber); Soil water; Soil composition; Environmental science; Agroforestry; Agroecosystem; Sorption,,,,,https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/handle/10355/14493,http://dx.doi.org/10.32469/10355/14493,,10.32469/10355/14493,2525173569,,0,057-714-072-954-341; 120-461-617-171-612,3

Vegetated buffer zones adjacent to a stream can effectively remove and retain nutrients and sediments. It is, therefore, important to study design criteria which optimise the effect of buffer zones (BZ). This paper describes the influence of four criteria: (i) buffer zone width, (ii) amount of surface runoff water entering the BZ, (iii) seasonal variation and (iv) vegetation type. These parameters were studied after simulated and natural runoff at four different sites in Southern Norway with cold temperate climate. Surface runoff was collected before entering and after passing the BZs. The simulation experiments were short-term experiments carried out over a few days in 1992 and 1993. In the natural runoff experiments, volume proportional mixed samples were collected after each runoff period during 1992–1999. The results show significantly higher removal efficiency (in %) from 10 m wide BZs compared to 5 m widths, however, the specific retention (per m 2 ) is higher in 5 m BZ. Buffer zones can receive particle runoff over several days without a significant decrease in their removal level. Retention efficiency between summer and autumn varied depending on the measured parameter (phosphorus, particles and nitrogen), and there were no significant differences in removal efficiency between summer and winter. The results show no significant differences between forest buffer zones (FBZ) and grass buffer zones (GBZ) regarding their retention efficiency for nitrogen and phosphorus. There was significantly higher retention efficiency in FBZ for particles. Average removal efficiencies from both simulated and natural runoff experiments varied from 60–89%, 37–81% and 81–91% for phosphorus, nitrogen and particles, respectively.",24,5,483,490,Seasonality; Nutrient; Eutrophication; Buffer zone; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Phosphorus; Temperate climate; Surface water,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857405000212,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2005.01.016,,10.1016/j.ecoleng.2005.01.016,1976989988,,0,003-058-957-402-489; 012-827-788-153-02X; 028-025-519-103-100; 038-659-320-814-260; 040-105-031-136-536; 040-198-568-662-726; 040-935-957-450-37X; 068-432-148-221-069; 076-826-572-086-275; 088-236-621-248-724; 123-547-078-308-929; 157-154-555-088-823; 167-013-613-510-038; 177-770-652-793-529; 194-099-531-712-460,100

Marshall; O. Francis; Z. L. Frogbrook; Bethanna Jackson; Neil McIntyre; Brian Reynolds; I. Solloway; Howard Wheater; Joanne Chell,"In response to growing concern about impacts of upland agricultural land management on flood risk, an intensely instrumented experimental catchment has been established at Pontbren, a sheep-farmed headwater catchment of the River Severn, UK. Primary aims are to develop understanding of the processes governing flood generation and the associated impacts of land management practices, and to bridge the gap between process understanding and ability to predict effects on downstream flooding. To achieve this, the experiment is designed to operate at plot (100 m2), hillslope (0·1 km2) and small catchment scale (10 km2). Hillslope-scale data, from an under-drained, agriculturally improved pasture, show that drain flow is a dominant runoff process. However, depending on antecedent moisture conditions, overland flow may exceed drain flow rates and can be an important contributor to peak flow runoff at the hillslope-scale. Flow, soil tension data and tracer tests confirm the importance of macropores and presence of perched water tables under normal wet conditions. Comparisons of pasture runoff with that from within a 10 year-old tree shelterbelt show significantly reduced overland flow due to the presence of trees and/or absence of sheep. Comparisons of soil hydraulic properties show significant increases in hydraulic conductivity and saturated moisture content of soil under trees compared to adjacent improved pasture.",23,3,464,475,Windbreak; Antecedent moisture; Water content; Hydrology; Environmental science; Agricultural land; Surface runoff; Land management; Macropore; Hydraulic conductivity,,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hyp.7157/abstract https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:307352 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009HyPr...23..464M/abstract http://core.ac.uk/display/380662 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093065819 http://homepage.usask.ca/~hsw171/Publications_PDFs/The%20impact%20of%20upland%20land%20management%20on%20flooding https://core.ac.uk/display/380662,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7157,,10.1002/hyp.7157,2166744591,,0,003-049-089-342-759; 003-359-023-457-872; 004-385-605-068-899; 005-274-402-888-402; 006-341-934-414-287; 008-071-382-068-35X; 009-363-498-928-375; 012-923-436-647-35X; 016-691-496-999-600; 019-045-465-456-358; 020-312-625-833-44X; 021-686-559-167-209; 022-153-202-185-345; 024-920-447-446-563; 024-953-196-350-874; 029-495-946-534-004; 029-597-773-419-987; 029-718-322-760-455; 030-114-367-979-539; 034-381-312-058-929; 046-039-516-984-280; 050-754-216-214-169; 051-565-264-749-444; 051-857-357-407-229; 052-297-433-232-533; 053-409-768-417-636; 055-958-971-265-88X; 056-898-331-239-872; 057-383-273-388-389; 058-931-650-286-179; 060-194-735-035-795; 063-360-851-454-92X; 064-329-027-938-708; 066-164-758-407-476; 067-350-191-385-602; 067-987-736-159-516; 069-066-158-720-776; 069-395-998-841-666; 070-156-038-664-620; 070-658-374-126-354; 071-671-601-194-465; 073-183-844-860-661; 079-313-171-037-398; 082-542-482-892-276; 082-692-682-466-910; 085-828-839-446-926; 086-080-523-947-176; 094-149-236-502-417; 096-208-638-422-460; 099-086-636-323-318; 099-354-891-726-163; 103-799-843-507-382; 111-636-457-852-472; 111-963-948-024-215; 119-290-684-672-389; 123-022-380-874-698; 124-090-786-756-123; 126-809-720-941-884; 130-238-506-258-740; 135-428-840-857-561; 137-332-135-951-858; 138-710-546-054-029; 148-404-795-413-907; 149-270-825-853-651; 150-534-207-186-064; 153-496-378-523-250; 157-454-691-749-520; 158-034-373-394-264; 158-798-172-113-93X; 162-682-787-097-518; 179-090-415-260-298; 180-148-409-989-319; 190-344-656-727-149,80

Plant communities in ﬁeld margins either devel-oped spontaneously or were sown with diﬀerent seedmixtures of grasses and forbs. Margins were mown twicea year and the cuttings were either removed or leftin situ. Three years after establishment, the importanceof the unsown rhizomatous species Elytrigia repens andUrtica dioica was signiﬁcantly higher in the unsowncommunity or when cuttings were not removed aftermowing. Seed dispersal from the margin into adjacentcrops was important in the unsown community duringthe ﬁrst year after establishment. Between 82% and 99%of the seeds were disseminated within 4 m from themargin strip. Overall risk of contaminating the adjacentcrop with weeds originating from the ﬁeld margin stripwas concentrated within a few metres of the crop edge.In order to minimise the dissemination of weed speciesand invasion by noxious vegetatively propagated weedson nutrient-rich land, it is recommended that ﬁeldmargins are established by sowing and cuttings removedafter each cut.Keywords: anemochorous species, rhizomatous species,cutting, margin strips, buffer, dispersal, wind.D",48,2,102,112,Invasive species; Crop; Sowing; Seed dispersal; Cutting; Weed; Biological dispersal; Plant community; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20083076403.html https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2007.00607.x https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20083076403 https://core.ac.uk/display/141987383,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2007.00607.x,,10.1111/j.1365-3180.2007.00607.x,2016660287,,0,000-669-594-539-024; 001-529-507-963-663; 004-934-482-757-916; 008-639-677-997-50X; 012-335-108-074-344; 015-072-120-385-142; 022-919-298-720-395; 030-029-963-940-335; 039-505-502-984-134; 043-663-463-772-769; 046-962-971-580-754; 050-501-006-116-67X; 060-212-024-680-436; 067-908-404-011-074; 071-543-579-732-418; 081-603-007-713-339; 082-115-306-249-349; 087-787-536-438-448; 088-907-824-639-930; 103-150-198-998-177; 104-056-309-665-566; 140-527-970-827-007; 149-751-397-612-305; 161-300-804-429-199; 167-175-414-731-307; 169-228-174-821-424; 175-603-458-395-585,34

Nicol,"Shelterbelts are common features of farm landscapes that provide shelter for livestock and crops and timber but may also benefit wildlife. The importance of shelterbelt plant diversity for birds was investigated by a survey of 62 sites in the Central West region of New South Wales, Australia. An area search technique was used to assess bird occurrence. An all subsets and exponential regression analysis approach explored the relationships between woody plant diversity and avifauna diversity (using Hill's diversity index), whilst seasonal variations were analysed using restricted maximum likelihood. Sixty-six bird species, including many that are woodland-dependent, representing eight foraging guilds, were observed in the shelterbelts. More species of birds occurred and at higher density in more floristically diverse shelterbelts. Other factors found to influence avifaunal use of shelterbelts were woody plant density, shelterbelt width, structural complexity, tree height, crown cover index and elevation. Seasonal analysis confirmed the importance of these independent variables but also revealed the significance of shelterbelt's proximity to water during summer for birds using this habitat. This study shows that floristic diversity, amongst other factors, is a significant predictor of avifauna diversity in shelterbelts and suggests that shelterbelts may be designed to optimize their wildlife habitat and biodiversity conservation values.",17,1,22,35,Woody plant; Windbreak; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Alpha diversity; Wildlife; Diversity index; Species richness; Abundance (ecology),,,,,https://www.publish.csiro.au/PC/PC110022 https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/en/publications/the-effect-of-woody-plant-diversity-and-other-stand-and-landscape,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/pc110022,,10.1071/pc110022,2226994787,,0,,6

However, the influence of riparian buffers on biotic assemblages in streams is poorly understood, particularly in the Midwestern United States. In this study, we evaluated the effects of riparian buffers on instream habitat, fish assemblage structure, and population characteristics (i.e., the growth of two small-bodied species) in three streams in central Iowa. The streams were surveyed at two spatial scales; specifically, 41 reaches were sampled and 247 macrohabitat types (i.e., pool, riffle, and run) were subsampled in the summer of 2007. Fish assemblage structure data were summarized into separate data sets by the relative abundance of individual species (i.e., fish per minute of electrofishing) and guilds (e.g., trop...",139,1,185,200,Riparian zone; Bank; Ecology; Riffle; Electrofishing; Population; Environmental science; STREAMS; Species richness; Coarse woody debris,,,,Iowa Department of Natural Resources; U.S. Geological Survey; Iowa State University,https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1577/T09-050.1 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20113177566.html https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20113177566 https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1577/T09-050.1 https://webpages.uidaho.edu/quistlab/publications/TAFS_2010_Fischer_buffers.pdf https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1577/T09-050.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/t09-050.1,,10.1577/t09-050.1,2160336769,,0,000-079-952-662-293; 001-119-833-238-908; 002-447-967-912-709; 002-937-270-631-538; 005-073-055-538-326; 007-677-584-264-981; 008-853-675-537-793; 009-866-331-372-242; 015-342-032-824-51X; 017-768-924-533-25X; 020-725-619-410-788; 021-327-640-556-792; 024-945-044-153-791; 025-193-868-192-213; 025-375-564-667-491; 028-894-425-243-393; 029-363-481-395-491; 030-086-614-786-713; 030-190-840-895-897; 032-514-448-851-196; 034-446-290-246-05X; 035-093-656-083-327; 038-415-452-349-494; 038-659-320-814-260; 040-806-887-128-56X; 042-985-809-167-140; 045-818-830-294-17X; 045-928-423-857-315; 046-945-039-781-986; 047-011-822-251-298; 049-228-560-288-794; 049-268-606-853-602; 049-470-648-249-55X; 053-215-034-439-654; 061-161-857-117-719; 061-428-533-348-203; 062-547-416-805-901; 062-840-277-915-897; 063-458-535-779-509; 065-800-486-460-895; 066-470-733-882-479; 068-985-051-096-126; 074-619-083-879-405; 076-177-949-073-945; 080-141-147-378-915; 081-512-632-037-846; 081-915-068-388-050; 083-470-819-062-099; 090-028-788-349-725; 095-104-916-898-838; 095-508-227-669-58X; 095-745-630-938-718; 097-346-718-682-010; 102-671-290-741-873; 103-446-610-149-904; 103-619-338-455-453; 105-480-324-845-599; 107-259-864-979-547; 109-239-155-072-779; 110-546-891-189-647; 111-131-334-729-243; 114-525-620-031-146; 116-065-618-368-696; 119-174-193-615-146; 128-373-399-847-303; 130-360-851-446-426; 136-168-078-387-585; 136-216-826-530-361; 141-101-347-131-583; 150-364-048-358-64X; 155-238-296-972-934; 194-917-923-184-160; 197-533-014-099-993; 198-964-217-558-388,44

Jones; R. J. Haggar,"ABSTRACT Grassland field margin strips, including hedge bottoms, may support a high diversity of wild flower and grass species. This diversity is threatened by applications of fertilizer nitrogen. Organic fertilizer, in the form of farm-yard manure and rain-diluted liquid slurry which only slowly release nitrogen for plant uptake, might prove less damaging. A 5-year experiment on two contrasting sheep grazed, species-rich grassland field margin sites adjoining a mature hedgerow in mid-Wales compared three levels of fertilizer N (0, 100 and 300 kg N ha−1 year−1) with farm yard manure (FYM) and rain-diluted slurry containing an average annual equivalent of 30–42 kg N ha−1 and 27–72 kg N ha−1 respectively. The aim was to assess the impact of treatments on the plant communities of the hedge bottom and field margin strip ecosystems, and to establish whether the species diversity contained within the strips could be encouraged without significantly undermining the quantity and quality of the herbage.

Udawatta; Clark J. Gantzer; Stephen H. Anderson; Harold E. Garrett,"Agroforestry and grass buffers can improve infiltration and reduce runoff from row-crop agriculture. The objective of this study was to examine buffer effects on soil porosity using high-resolution x-ray computed tomography (CT). Treatments studied were agroforestry buffer, grass buffer, and row crop (RC) on a Putnam silt loam (fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Albaqualf). A no-till corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation was established in 1991, with buffers implemented in 1997. Agroforestry buffers, 4.5 m wide and 36.5 m apart, consisted of pin oak (Quercus palustris Munchh.) trees planted among redtop (Agrostis gigantea Roth) and brome (Bromus spp.) grasses and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.). Two replicates of intact soil cores (76-mm diam. by 76-mm long) were collected from the 0- to 100-mm depth. Cores were scanned at a voxel size of 73 by 73 by 84 μm. Images were analyzed with Three-Dimensional Medial Axis (3DMA) software. The average pore paths for grass and agroforestry buffer samples were three and five times greater, respectively, than for RC. On average, buffer samples had a 33% higher characteristic coordination number than RC samples. Buffer samples had a higher characteristic path length constant (2.18 times the RC treatment) and an average lower path tortuosity (89% of the RC treatment) relative to values for RC. Average nodal pore volume and throat radii of buffers were 1.8 and 2.9 times larger, respectively, than for RC. Results show that three-dimensional structural differences caused by variations in root growth or organic matter accumulation discriminated between buffer and row crop soil, allowing better quantification of management effects on soil porosity.",72,2,295,304,Loam; Infiltration (hydrology); Soil science; Row crop; Quercus palustris; Lotus corniculatus; Bromus; Mathematics; Organic matter; Surface runoff; Agroforestry,,,,University of Missouri Center,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008SSASJ..72..295U/abstract https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/sssaj/pdfs/72/2/295 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj2007.0057,http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2007.0057,,10.2136/sssaj2007.0057,2023174896,,0,001-822-468-539-247; 005-742-835-423-082; 008-297-788-251-260; 008-380-052-396-94X; 009-005-344-197-16X; 009-313-606-707-911; 011-962-153-122-815; 016-058-199-557-351; 020-283-929-592-323; 028-636-741-535-919; 032-530-534-833-517; 034-993-987-742-160; 035-543-529-952-302; 035-651-723-034-386; 036-466-585-417-013; 038-439-180-047-201; 039-067-406-640-49X; 043-808-568-721-890; 044-854-123-160-115; 050-703-102-336-010; 050-920-571-780-924; 055-943-387-311-507; 056-771-181-078-760; 060-014-530-430-600; 064-074-044-196-046; 065-433-736-058-769; 071-985-163-769-653; 073-010-543-260-341; 078-450-500-934-861; 085-811-305-094-291; 088-017-310-971-747; 095-312-534-361-222; 096-347-768-161-81X; 103-005-985-367-373; 107-746-071-221-582; 111-288-588-656-115; 143-513-713-287-048; 156-444-953-017-974; 165-458-131-680-973; 166-931-549-493-224; 168-599-905-482-320; 170-256-364-738-510; 176-494-935-293-482; 183-727-840-702-501,61

Plush; David B. Orr; Chris Reberg-Horton; Beth Gardner,"Field borders established for wildlife conservation have been recognized as a possible venue for also promoting beneficial insect populations, such as parasitic wasps and pollinators, on agricultural lands. However, traditional fallow field borders lack nectar sources required to sustain beneficial insect communities, and their value to small mammals is not well-understood. In October–November 2009, we trapped small mammals in four field-border treatments (planted native, warm-season grasses and prairie flowers, planted prairie flowers only, fallow vegetation, and frequently mowed vegetation) replicated around nine organic crop fields, and developed closed-population models in Program MARK to estimate abundance in each border. We also measured vegetation cover within each border treatment from June to August 2009. We captured 491 individuals of two species, the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) and house mouse (Mus musculus). Cotton rat abundance was ≥2 times greater in grass and flower borders and flowers-only borders than in fallow borders, likely because of greater vegetation density and availability of preferred foods in planted borders. No cotton rats were captured in mowed borders, and house mouse abundance was ≥5 times lower in mowed borders than in other border types. Lower abundance of cotton rats and house mice in mowed borders emphasizes the importance of structurally complex non-crop vegetation for supporting small-mammal communities in agricultural landscapes. Field borders planted to promote beneficial insects may be a useful tool for maximizing the ecological services provided by non-crop vegetation. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.",37,1,209,215,Pollinator; Wildlife conservation; Vegetation; Habitat; Ecology; Beneficial insects; Wildlife; House mice; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wsb.226/abstract https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wsb.226 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wsb.226,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wsb.226,,10.1002/wsb.226,1996518389,,0,001-606-475-599-372; 002-669-586-055-41X; 012-115-765-872-472; 016-052-929-723-298; 016-668-072-913-249; 017-061-128-717-702; 018-177-593-857-47X; 027-591-409-062-387; 028-027-162-780-756; 029-067-159-542-004; 029-095-035-362-536; 038-659-320-814-260; 038-663-860-675-689; 039-729-154-891-427; 039-936-551-657-61X; 040-618-665-169-421; 041-150-839-644-399; 042-303-914-852-499; 045-301-379-894-290; 051-484-238-733-751; 056-892-630-404-500; 058-159-233-872-010; 066-602-242-017-220; 068-488-271-134-879; 072-312-107-731-52X; 076-849-835-521-542; 076-882-068-709-783; 082-797-391-654-568; 083-625-672-314-565; 092-953-239-167-292; 093-083-861-404-120; 093-501-924-946-904; 097-679-403-528-057; 097-789-429-598-931; 100-962-377-209-254; 106-173-595-941-095; 109-981-609-140-542; 116-546-345-515-722; 118-574-845-632-686; 119-711-051-116-780; 121-111-684-893-259; 135-883-559-011-411; 145-460-316-879-599; 148-401-372-350-197; 152-801-703-727-380; 153-395-543-029-369; 165-948-554-708-693; 173-725-585-059-659; 195-618-519-387-640; 196-397-254-412-731,39

Gut; Mark E. Whalon,"Management of Oriental fruit moth, Grapholitha molesta (Busck), in apple using an ‘Enhanced Integrated Pest Management (IPM)’ program comprised of a hedgerow barrier, pheromone-based mating disruption and reduced-risk [non-organophosphorous (OP) or carbamate] insecticides was investigated over a 5-year period. The barrier was comprised of a planting of three rows of hybrid poplar, Populus deltoides Bartr.×Populus nigra L., one row of Italian alder, Alnus cordata L. (nectar reward), and one row of white pine, Pinus strobus L. The hedgerow completely surrounded the perimeter of the apple orchard and was treated with garlic and a low rate of pyrethroid insecticide in 4 of the 5 years. The Enhanced IPM program significantly reduced G. molesta populations as measured by moth captures in pheromone traps. Captures of G. molesta were significantly higher in apple orchards treated with OP and carbamate insecticides, ‘Conventional IPM’, and either not surrounded by the hedgerow or with the barrier present but not treated with the repellent compounds. To explain these differences in G. molesta control, and the potential non-lethal effect of hedgerow barriers on G. molesta orchard colonization, we studied the adult vertical movement in a traditional unsprayed standard apple orchard at three different heights: 0.95, 1.95 and 3.20 m, respectively. In the overwintering generation at a height of 0.95 and 1.95 m, the mean number of moths captured per sampling period was 14.64 and 14.84, respectively, and only 2.95 at 3.20 m. However, the number of individuals captured in the second and third generations was not significantly different at the three different heights. Fruit damage evaluated before ‘June drop’ closely corresponded to the distribution of moths captured during the overwintering generation. Fruit damage at a height of 1.95 and 3.20 m was 5.8 and 3.5%, respectively. These results indicated that G. molesta is a weak flyer and that hedgerow barriers exerted some influence in the colonization of the orchard by limiting the free movement of adults from the overwintering generation. Thus, hedgerow barriers seem to limit early migration and establishment of G. molesta in the orchard. This in turn may reduce the size of the following generations and makes subsequent control easier under the Enhanced IPM program.",22,3,181,188,Integrated pest management; Horticulture; Sowing; Lepidoptera genitalia; Overwintering; Mating disruption; Tortricidae; Orchard; Botany; Biology; Pheromone trap,,,,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/renewable-agriculture-and-food-systems/article/abs/hedgerow-barriers-and-other-reducedrisk-controls-for-managing-oriental-fruit-moth-grapholitha-molesta-busck-lepidoptera-tortricidae-in-apples/50EFDFD0C73A0854DEAC35DEBFFD4A01 http://www.journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S174217050700172X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s174217050700172x,,10.1017/s174217050700172x,2064360794,,0,001-117-036-989-961; 002-887-040-958-911; 008-880-115-899-917; 009-131-733-785-739; 026-344-569-791-04X; 026-477-663-158-346; 036-942-107-401-601; 042-279-365-998-518; 042-899-584-386-48X; 047-338-978-786-859; 049-989-415-073-814; 052-702-128-160-058; 055-979-589-235-498; 056-334-294-066-963; 058-297-516-826-693; 061-898-458-174-202; 065-873-654-555-39X; 084-275-838-394-382; 086-134-595-070-829; 096-117-101-633-74X; 099-945-073-346-227; 101-141-337-695-831; 102-129-602-824-134; 121-546-233-792-347; 124-415-021-260-946; 136-605-313-386-287; 136-680-161-744-080; 139-945-804-595-593; 145-749-226-671-054; 164-543-048-489-609; 189-542-124-642-20X,5

Here, we evaluate the relative contribution of environmental conditions, history of management practices within hedgerows, and adjacent land-use on herb and shrub species distribution in woody hedgerows of agricultural landscapes of southern Quebec, Canada. We pay particular attention to the distribution of forest herbs and weed species and identify the main factors that explain their presence. We also evaluate the amount of spatial structuring in the species data and explanatory variables. Our results show significant differences in species composition related to the unique influence of all sets of factors considered. Adjacent land-use (from intensive crop to fallow land) remains the best predictor of overall species distribution, followed by environmental conditions and history of management practices. The probability of finding forest herbs in hedgerows increases as intensity of adjacent agricultural practices (from intensive crop to fallow land) decreases. Potential weed species, on the other hand, are more likely to be found within narrow hedgerows adjacent to the more intensively managed fields. We discuss the results in terms of the interactions between the different determinants of plant diversity in hedgerows and demonstrate the necessity to distinguish between multiple structuring factors to devise proper conservation strategies. Such strategies will have to take into account the ecological as well as the agricultural exploitation context in which linear features are found to be effective.",105,3,355,367,Species distribution; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Weed; Vegetation type; Context (language use); Land use; Habitat conservation; Landscape ecology,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20023110510 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20023110510.html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320701002191,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0006-3207(01)00219-1,,10.1016/s0006-3207(01)00219-1,2007830211,,0,002-481-178-498-479; 004-807-568-531-692; 007-243-303-723-240; 007-361-282-044-640; 022-648-804-684-488; 025-094-907-006-599; 027-519-609-839-131; 028-917-029-117-685; 029-386-831-957-40X; 030-861-033-911-111; 031-532-300-342-70X; 032-961-767-789-531; 035-857-688-042-308; 037-610-129-120-822; 038-629-353-825-41X; 041-589-824-696-381; 047-148-330-480-577; 047-949-455-932-004; 051-197-969-663-775; 051-541-813-281-746; 055-359-412-300-445; 062-036-445-726-722; 063-003-550-683-547; 064-724-577-954-665; 068-143-605-669-192; 069-222-611-667-46X; 073-387-419-745-798; 073-798-803-161-275; 079-913-994-832-084; 080-615-210-297-301; 089-627-402-193-481; 091-707-812-404-482; 096-074-282-606-638; 100-152-690-804-696; 102-275-999-383-853; 124-372-782-901-413; 136-330-704-990-297; 144-368-131-037-143; 155-555-776-794-70X; 156-624-196-949-616; 157-623-975-380-782; 165-123-901-414-731; 174-103-363-317-763; 187-050-769-304-212; 195-369-716-717-018,71

Here, we divided the environmental predictors into three groups: site conditions, hedge stand and landscape structure. We determined their independent and joint effects on the richness of four guilds of herbaceous species in 92 hedge stands in a north-Mediterranean intensive agricultural landscape. The fine—(at 550 m) spatial patterns of the key environmental predictors and the pure spatial effects on species richness were measured using a computation of the principal coordinates of a matrix of geographical neighbours integrated into a variation partitioning. The total explained variation of species richness among hedgerows was highest for wetland herbs (62 %), with increasing rates for rare plants (33 %), forest herbs (43 %) and arable weeds (47 %). 43–11 % of that variation was spatially structured and mostly explained by some of the key environmental predictors, such as proportion of a given landuse, presence of woody species and dead trees. This indicates that complex relationships between herbaceous species distribution and spatial processes exist in woody field margins and much of that is related to key factors which are spatially structured, both at fine or broad-scales, with implications for management and landuse planning.",215,11,1323,1335,Biodiversity; Species distribution; Explained variation; Plant ecology; Spatial ecology; Ecology; Geography; Herbaceous plant; Species richness; Wetland,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11258-014-0390-3 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11258-014-0390-3.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/53509868 http://nectar.northampton.ac.uk/7319/ https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11258-014-0390-3 https://pure.northampton.ac.uk/en/publications/environmental-factors-interact-with-spatial-processes-to-determin,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-014-0390-3,,10.1007/s11258-014-0390-3,1978395493,,0,000-329-241-681-366; 000-844-784-381-390; 002-237-159-846-242; 003-164-963-858-748; 005-512-432-318-655; 007-243-303-723-240; 007-361-282-044-640; 007-513-938-529-086; 008-524-220-939-553; 008-532-010-264-113; 012-837-436-940-918; 016-944-193-681-825; 018-023-127-841-209; 019-620-620-455-821; 021-907-377-633-412; 025-990-754-410-325; 029-386-831-957-40X; 030-447-992-070-481; 032-827-584-197-827; 033-516-756-755-898; 033-700-829-861-131; 035-009-096-849-878; 038-684-107-777-426; 038-842-899-494-678; 039-524-631-746-697; 041-832-390-230-812; 042-303-914-852-499; 046-576-613-279-579; 046-958-588-669-586; 049-873-769-538-557; 051-075-307-068-357; 055-051-694-358-299; 055-550-829-369-961; 056-789-845-462-569; 056-853-001-254-085; 057-519-831-748-44X; 058-402-866-495-275; 059-851-177-532-034; 060-009-962-481-27X; 062-441-837-157-062; 063-141-893-182-571; 066-720-761-510-452; 071-601-864-758-089; 073-081-550-194-627; 075-473-503-904-660; 077-236-133-681-415; 079-478-547-689-067; 085-203-134-840-413; 086-986-301-822-870; 088-470-568-990-908; 104-585-984-068-400; 107-288-823-712-339; 108-007-092-968-56X; 109-693-850-240-463; 111-095-683-961-870; 117-345-687-903-78X; 118-194-599-562-277; 120-912-616-612-99X; 123-202-765-417-728; 126-864-491-847-81X; 140-153-774-533-366; 140-717-945-643-748; 145-702-327-492-460; 146-049-767-266-181; 150-325-162-873-23X; 150-494-637-604-381; 156-624-196-949-616; 174-103-363-317-763; 181-109-277-069-530; 184-006-961-600-508; 187-050-769-304-212,7

Chamorro; Laura José-María; José M. Blanco-Moreno; F. Xavier Sans,"Field boundaries are expected to support the maintenance of biodiversity in agroecosystems, since they provide the habitat for a range of plant species. However, plant diversity in field boundaries has decreased substantially in recent decades. This pattern is generally linked with the intensification of agricultural land use at field and landscape level. Therefore, we aimed to test the effect of farming management (field and boundary management), boundary structure (width and habitat assemblage considering the Mediterranean grassland element), and landscape heterogeneity on plant species richness of field boundaries. Plants were recorded along 30 field boundaries next to organic fields and 30 next to conventional fields located in 15 agrarian localities of NE Iberian Peninsula along a gradient of landscape complexity. A total of 517 plant species were identified in the 60 field boundaries. We recorded 162 species (31%) catalogued as rare, very rare or extremely rare in the flora of the Catalan Countries. Our results showed the importance of landscape heterogeneity, field management and habitat assemblage, since they were found to be the most influential variables for plant species richness; whereas boundary width and boundary management were seen to contribute less to explaining plant diversity. Accordingly, agri-environmental schemes should be designed to promote organic farming and maintain the structure of the landscape mosaic in order to benefit plant diversity in field boundaries in the Mediterranean region.",21,4,1101,1114,Organic farming; Biodiversity; Habitat; Ecology; Range (biology); Geography; Grassland; Mediterranean climate; Agricultural land; Species richness; Agroforestry,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10531-012-0245-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-012-0245-y,,10.1007/s10531-012-0245-y,2081518934,,0,007-243-303-723-240; 015-072-120-385-142; 015-348-182-108-487; 018-797-363-505-484; 019-604-635-334-846; 023-935-502-746-047; 025-117-138-466-353; 035-554-920-955-542; 039-505-502-984-134; 041-189-041-797-765; 043-463-611-459-20X; 045-445-063-674-649; 045-640-805-432-475; 046-922-146-668-557; 047-546-677-833-03X; 048-043-005-406-918; 049-346-208-924-920; 049-774-123-059-115; 054-274-474-416-858; 054-622-824-887-990; 054-715-078-148-813; 063-003-550-683-547; 073-021-383-708-605; 074-225-773-604-407; 076-278-055-254-459; 078-079-592-389-245; 085-216-099-100-868; 087-196-632-155-849; 097-795-246-687-158; 101-656-029-176-741; 102-049-479-595-742; 115-537-551-650-895; 125-107-781-556-450; 125-512-608-629-475; 142-939-430-049-615; 149-639-400-919-499; 150-062-616-431-988; 154-750-119-428-838; 155-378-411-198-767; 155-691-175-864-748; 174-765-916-829-017; 188-597-703-306-560; 193-192-566-363-66X,16

Grala; John C. Tyndall; Carl W. Mize,"A sample of 1,500 farmers and 2,000 non-farmers were surveyed during 2005-2006 to examine the impact of field windbreaks on visual appearance of agricultural lands in Iowa, USA. About 73% of respondents indicated that field windbreaks diversified visual appearance of agricultural landscapes, whereas 67% of these respondents thought that windbreaks made agricultural lands visually more appealing. An improved aesthetics of the area was fourth most frequently mentioned reason for planting field windbreaks reported by 21% of respondents. When compared to other windbreak benefits, however, improved aesthetics of agricultural landscapes was ranked as the least important windbreak benefit. Majority of respondents (50%) preferred groups of trees planted in straight rows followed by groups of trees nested between agricultural fields (23%), groups of trees planted in non-straight rows (20%), and single trees dispersed between fields (7%). Respondents preferred windbreaks that were tall, wide, long, and continuous. Most of them (74%) preferred field windbreaks consisting of trees and shrubs, whereas 69% preferred windbreaks in which conifers were mixed with hardwoods. Respondents who preferred groups of trees planted in non-straight rows were 5.0 times more likely to indicate that windbreaks improved visual appearance of agricultural lands than those who preferred single trees. Those who preferred groups of trees nested between agricultural fields or groups of trees planted in straight rows were 3.6 and 2.6 times more likely, respectively, to indicate that windbreaks improved visual appearance of agricultural lands in comparison to those who preferred single trees.",80,3,411,422,Agriculture; Windbreak; Visual appearance; Sowing; Geography; Rural environment; Aesthetic value; Agricultural landscapes; Agricultural land; Agroforestry,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103339299.html https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/793595 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10457-010-9335-6 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103339299,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-010-9335-6,,10.1007/s10457-010-9335-6,2034195046,,0,002-469-107-235-59X; 002-804-556-350-740; 008-919-831-082-639; 012-044-411-704-37X; 012-242-501-352-985; 014-690-148-208-772; 016-915-486-723-598; 036-347-384-107-500; 039-139-222-104-510; 044-623-657-378-698; 045-714-993-332-728; 047-949-455-932-004; 048-184-176-726-894; 048-462-271-856-301; 051-982-374-983-044; 064-157-508-014-006; 065-975-858-976-759; 068-789-689-250-577; 072-525-209-335-180; 078-152-162-481-023; 079-268-656-589-609; 079-913-994-832-084; 080-471-586-769-952; 080-484-175-982-778; 089-961-115-838-172; 101-484-022-180-424; 102-602-517-987-677; 106-653-949-616-859; 108-704-115-239-620; 116-989-692-803-801; 118-609-358-485-874; 119-090-939-467-541; 122-130-322-941-794; 126-903-252-358-903; 126-952-687-817-313; 128-225-049-436-489; 129-514-064-370-948; 140-727-624-405-801; 144-146-494-036-891; 156-624-196-949-616; 157-802-642-766-031; 160-814-066-258-368; 164-509-199-251-893; 164-569-626-218-284; 167-042-437-214-370; 182-441-851-953-373; 182-654-132-660-098; 184-264-557-168-487,21

Sanderson; Ronald M. Jones; Marshall J. McFarland; Jason Stroup; R.L. Reed; James P. Muir,"Manure use on cropland has raised concern about nutrient contamination of surface and ground waters. Warm-season perennial grasses may be useful in filter strips to trap manure nutrients and as biomass feedstock for nutrient removal. We explored the use of 'Alamo' switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) in a biomass production-filter strip system treated with dairy manure. We measured changes in extractable P in the soil, NO3 -N in soil water, and changes in total reactive P and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of runoff water before and after a switchgrass filter strip. Five rates of dairy manure (target rates of 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg N ha(-1) from solid manure in 1995; 0, 75, 150, 300, and 600 kg N ha(-1) from lagoon effluent in 1996 and 1997) were surface-applied to field plots of switchgrass (5.2 by 16.4 m) with a 5.2- by 16.4-m switchgrass filter strip below the manured area. Yield of switchgrass from the manured area increased linearly with increasing manure rate in each year. Soil water samples collected at 46 or 91 cm below the soil surface on 30 dates indicated < 3 mg L(-1) of NO3-N in all plots. Concentrations of total reactive P in surface runoff water were reduced an average of 47% for the 150 kg N rate and 76% for the 600 kg N rate in 1996 and 1997 after passing through the strip. Manure could effectively substitute for inorganic fertilizer in switchgrass biomass production with dual use of the switchgrass as a vegetative filter strip.",30,1,210,216,Nutrient; Soil water; Biomass; Panicum virgatum; Water quality; Filter strip; Manure; Environmental science; Agronomy; Water pollution,,"Animals; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biomass; Cattle; Fertilizers; Filtration; Manure; Nitrogen/metabolism; Phosphorus/metabolism; Poaceae; Water Pollution/prevention & control",Fertilizers; Manure; Phosphorus; Nitrogen,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11215655 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20013028089 https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/30/1/210 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/11215655 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2001.301210x,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2001.301210x,11215655,10.2134/jeq2001.301210x,2062522821,,0,002-694-762-628-34X; 005-608-497-724-538; 007-071-648-273-363; 021-007-796-232-222; 024-080-549-569-311; 028-456-883-608-759; 034-601-124-321-55X; 040-394-639-466-836; 040-661-113-878-67X; 050-232-707-053-533; 055-590-572-243-787; 058-629-644-932-704; 062-282-922-399-095; 076-826-572-086-275; 080-460-585-508-028; 082-797-391-654-568; 093-945-968-495-567; 102-307-069-255-349; 103-231-338-453-473; 113-362-843-406-670; 128-195-997-346-382; 133-363-147-232-814; 145-628-223-693-935; 160-331-973-087-842; 177-425-278-398-731; 177-770-652-793-529; 183-829-059-857-668,76

Understanding the environmental factors that structure biodiversity and food webs among communities is central to assess and mitigate the impact of landscape changes. 2. Wildflower strips are ecological compensation areas established in farmland to increase pollination services and biological control of crop pests and to conserve insect diversity. They are arranged in networks in order to favour high species richness and abundance of the fauna. 3. We describe results from experimental wildflower strips in a fragmented agricultural landscape, comparing the importance of landscape, of spatial arrangement and of vegetation on the diversity and abundance of trap-nesting bees, wasps and their enemies, and the structure of their food webs. 4. The proportion of forest cover close to the wildflower strips and the landscape heterogeneity stood out as the most influential landscape elements, resulting in a more complex trap-nest community with higher abundance and richness of hosts, and with more links between species in the food webs and a higher diversity of interactions. We disentangled the underlying mechanisms for variation in these quantitative food web metrics. 5. We conclude that in order to increase the diversity and abundance of pollinators and biological control agents and to favour a potentially stable community of cavity-nesting hymenoptera in wildflower strips, more investment is needed in the conservation and establishment of forest habitats within agro-ecosystems, as a reservoir of beneficial insect populations.",82,6,1203,1214,Biodiversity; Food chain; Habitat; Ecology; Wildflower; Species richness; Ecosystem services; Abundance (ecology); Biology; Landscape ecology,biological control agents; ecological compensation areas; ecosystem services; landscape ecology; parasitism; pollinators; quantitative food webs; trap nest; wildflower strip,Agriculture; Animals; Bees/physiology; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Food Chain; Seasons; Switzerland; Wasps/physiology,,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2656.12103 http://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/87139 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/623053 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2F1365-2656.12103 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2656.12103%4010.1111/%28ISSN%292041-210X.POLLINATOR https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.12103 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.12103/abstract http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/87139/1/jane12103.pdf https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/0aa71e68-b902-38f6-b871-521c78b5bc87/ https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2656.12103 https://doc.rero.ch/record/209159/files/ber_ils.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23863136 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23863136 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2F1365-2656.12103 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2656.12103%4010.1111/%28ISSN%291365-2664.POLLINATOR https://core.ac.uk/download/36137192.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12103,23863136,10.1111/1365-2656.12103,2149565492,,0,000-479-461-791-069; 004-800-443-905-695; 004-951-469-878-072; 006-629-353-249-116; 006-802-485-818-444; 007-112-379-052-316; 010-171-254-110-63X; 010-225-312-935-498; 010-240-517-804-374; 012-539-445-932-252; 013-650-603-992-421; 019-327-814-654-586; 021-854-472-647-242; 024-563-263-002-666; 025-590-233-770-242; 025-990-754-410-325; 026-259-305-381-913; 026-327-452-047-95X; 026-978-812-686-659; 027-867-910-497-397; 029-386-831-957-40X; 031-987-261-230-852; 032-452-486-736-649; 036-745-557-397-483; 043-334-181-578-717; 044-454-043-957-818; 044-696-607-418-37X; 045-823-211-221-277; 048-695-803-210-702; 048-954-410-039-696; 049-346-208-924-920; 050-229-016-868-066; 053-197-832-022-128; 053-505-331-627-489; 055-439-916-692-702; 056-789-845-462-569; 056-822-231-800-190; 057-420-111-160-322; 061-270-720-272-198; 063-141-893-182-571; 064-638-334-902-296; 066-376-824-715-720; 067-857-418-140-179; 069-088-356-872-866; 072-243-200-215-136; 074-793-529-288-006; 075-336-397-615-388; 075-666-685-673-883; 077-532-222-012-842; 092-636-423-048-294; 093-147-406-768-547; 107-188-835-457-613; 115-242-236-501-007; 117-345-687-903-78X; 122-154-985-613-384; 145-176-906-866-327; 145-523-815-049-35X; 154-978-657-665-321; 166-167-543-032-020; 166-249-452-125-482,58

Potts; Ben A. Woodcock; Paul Eggleton,"Abstract A primary objective of agri-environment schemes is the conservation of biodiversity; in addition to increasing the value of farmland for wildlife, these schemes also aim to restore natural ecosystem functioning. The management of scheme options can influence their value for delivering ecosystem services by modifying the composition of floral and faunal communities. This study examines the impact of an agri-environment scheme prescription on ecosystem functioning by testing the hypothesis that vegetation management influences decomposition rates in grassy arable field margins. The effects of two vegetation management practices in arable field margins – cutting and soil disturbance (scarification) – on litter decomposition were compared using a litterbag experimental approach in early April 2006. Bags had either small mesh designed to restrict access to soil macrofauna, or large mesh that would allow macrofauna to enter. Bags were positioned on the soil surface or inserted into the soil in cut and scarified margins, retrieved after 44, 103 and 250 days and the amount of litter mass remaining was calculated. Litter loss from the litterbags with large mesh was greater than from the small mesh bags, providing evidence that soil macrofauna accelerate rates of litter decomposition. In the large mesh bags, the proportion of litter remaining in bags above and belowground in the cut plots was similar, while in the scarified plots, there was significantly more litter left in the aboveground bags than in the belowground bags. This loss of balance between decomposition rates above and belowground in scarified margins may have implications for the development and maintenance of grassy arable field margins by influencing nutrient availability for plant communities.",41,1,90,97,Ecosystem; Tillage; Vegetation; Litter; Environmental science; Plant community; Soil biology; Agroforestry; Ecosystem services; Agronomy; Arable land,,,,,http://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND44141355 https://core.ac.uk/display/347104 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/744106 http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/9186/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139308001613,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2008.09.003,,10.1016/j.apsoil.2008.09.003,1971816230,,0,001-575-548-525-27X; 003-460-280-575-85X; 006-848-972-549-61X; 007-847-412-148-043; 010-472-819-956-683; 015-725-664-867-946; 020-564-612-156-583; 022-526-631-372-455; 024-716-859-528-663; 025-307-718-158-485; 030-453-266-652-445; 036-818-291-335-617; 042-303-914-852-499; 045-678-307-793-220; 046-093-341-056-083; 050-364-885-261-831; 054-937-102-797-519; 058-513-758-659-975; 059-659-598-431-039; 064-142-249-606-389; 069-688-387-812-670; 071-173-838-672-398; 075-513-114-392-773; 077-911-524-409-482; 094-442-752-754-939; 098-719-657-126-04X; 107-465-507-701-19X; 116-759-930-330-613; 117-992-826-323-082; 118-807-690-083-030; 122-528-143-728-138; 125-786-651-769-041; 128-760-888-268-265; 135-233-059-071-616; 136-229-404-898-732; 145-653-851-729-665; 158-498-105-839-226; 171-868-007-830-355; 186-405-649-407-27X; 188-361-607-873-337,9

We hypothesize that sorption equilibrium was not achieved in 2004 because of the short delay (<24 h) between herbicide application and the first rain event. In 2005, observations suggest that possible changing sorption equilibrium conditions were reached (20 days after atrazine application), especially for eroded sediments submitted to changing environmental conditions in subsurface. If confirmed by other experiments, this will raise the question of the representativeness of laboratory-determined soil sorption coefficients to predict the fate of pesticides.",47,10,967,974,Environmental chemistry; Infiltration (hydrology); Thermodynamic equilibrium; Pesticide; Atrazine; Sediment; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Sorption,,Adsorption; Environmental Restoration and Remediation/instrumentation; Herbicides/chemistry; Kinetics; Soil Pollutants/chemistry; Vegetables/chemistry,Herbicides; Soil Pollutants,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03601234.2012.706565 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22938581,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2012.706565,22938581,10.1080/03601234.2012.706565,2079256323,,0,002-650-706-842-54X; 006-677-293-260-300; 007-029-250-638-239; 007-985-273-091-256; 009-882-195-213-342; 011-230-574-777-701; 013-902-785-206-118; 015-334-237-353-133; 019-097-060-614-658; 022-491-237-741-390; 024-253-712-463-916; 039-557-080-642-218; 045-878-014-461-966; 046-104-331-252-268; 046-446-501-703-050; 065-399-339-779-689; 082-845-308-557-999; 086-496-072-727-834; 101-705-375-977-590; 113-859-313-579-316; 122-905-248-651-828; 145-377-988-718-061; 161-510-717-241-396; 165-305-190-275-110,3

Baker; Andrew Bissett; Peter H. Thrall,"Abstract In south-eastern Australia, strips of planted native trees and shrubs (shelterbelts) are frequently established to restore ecosystem services altered by agriculture. Despite their wide use, little is known about the effects of establishing shelterbelts on soil macro invertebrates, especially earthworms, which are of major importance in soil processes. We assessed earthworm composition, diversity and biomass in three land use systems: native shelterbelts dominated by Acacia and Eucalyptus species, agricultural pastures and native remnant woodland fragments dominated by Eucalyptus blakelyi and/or Eucalyptus melliodora . Earthworm communities differed significantly among systems, with abundance, biomass and diversity greatest under pasture. Within shelterbelts we saw a shift from high earthworm biomass and density to low with increasing time after establishment. Soil edaphic variables did not correlate strongly with earthworm biomass or density, but were correlated with earthworm community composition. Overall the introduction of native woody vegetation was associated with a decline in density and biomass of earthworms, including a decrease in the relative abundance of exotic species. As such shelterbelts can be used to promote native earthworm relative abundance, which may be important for local diversity, soil function and landscape connectivity.",88,,32,40,Biomass (ecology); Introduced species; Ecology; Eucalyptus blakelyi; Earthworm; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus melliodora; Agronomy; Edaphic; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/98737 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139314003357 https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/98737 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Bissett/publication/272101509_Earthworm_composition_diversity_and_biomass_under_three_land_use_systems_in_south-eastern_Australia/links/555a69d508ae6943a877ce75.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2014.12.002,,10.1016/j.apsoil.2014.12.002,2021782618,,0,001-583-780-549-153; 004-980-979-607-97X; 010-983-593-435-301; 012-529-298-894-778; 013-187-467-917-416; 015-576-414-633-083; 019-270-592-145-713; 019-337-810-138-049; 022-721-184-238-409; 025-554-841-582-36X; 026-625-988-920-011; 027-513-222-249-025; 029-053-200-785-140; 032-165-214-693-647; 034-454-007-726-657; 040-152-335-123-920; 040-670-527-127-133; 040-956-990-039-171; 041-589-824-696-381; 041-893-754-064-173; 045-074-428-824-575; 046-502-234-294-670; 047-759-162-101-971; 048-475-737-668-496; 050-259-349-588-342; 050-463-567-782-280; 051-948-846-960-395; 051-983-996-793-151; 053-125-869-782-021; 059-003-128-993-115; 062-168-809-018-992; 062-841-053-586-232; 063-130-348-705-185; 066-580-629-631-992; 068-051-732-934-472; 077-825-139-906-246; 077-971-926-296-999; 078-439-174-966-632; 080-016-040-168-86X; 083-809-816-992-522; 084-932-304-217-75X; 089-287-632-662-513; 090-367-638-411-200; 093-439-230-974-674; 094-289-806-531-186; 094-569-926-838-197; 095-513-146-752-88X; 097-647-363-385-947; 103-137-336-464-100; 105-328-206-485-303; 129-989-505-935-254; 132-048-390-996-279; 140-005-986-677-703; 140-347-002-335-787; 146-576-261-428-571; 150-660-392-362-361; 168-744-090-896-896; 181-098-723-260-538; 184-648-323-326-385; 198-751-462-183-656; 199-230-660-788-472,11

Palmer; Shane D. Wellendorf; James R. Gillis; Peter T. Bromley,"Abstract Fallow-field borders along edges of crop fields have been promoted for increasing northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) on farms and are a component of recovery plans for this species. However, research on bobwhite population response to field-border practices is sparse. Previous research on 2 farms documented increased use of farm fields and greater reproduction by bobwhites on farms with field borders, but nesting success was low during May and June. Bobwhite population response to field-border practices may increase when they are combined with nest-predator reduction on farms. Effect of nest-predator reduction on bobwhite populations on farmed landscapes has not been investigated in the Southeast. Therefore, we tested the effects of field borders and mesomammal nest-predator reduction on bobwhite abundance on 12 farms in eastern North Carolina, 1997–1999. We applied treatments to farms as factorial combinations.

Brunner; P. Hann; Thomas Wrbka; Bernhard Kromp,"Wireworms, the larvae of click beetles are world-wide pests of arable and vegetable crops. Many studies have shown that arthropods are influenced by landscape context. Therefore, for successful wireworm risk assessment, it is important to gain more information on relationships between landscape structure and wireworm infestation level. The aim of this study was to investigate if different landscape variables are related to wireworm infestation, represented by the proportion of wireworm damaged potato tubers. Based on aerial photographs and field surveys landscape variables, such as landscape composition, landscape complexity and ecological variables were characterised around 14 randomly selected potato field plots alongside the gradient from the lower warm-dry “Weinviertel” (region 1) to the cool-humid “Waldviertel” (region 2) in the North-East of Austria at three scales (1, 9 and 25 ha). Relationships between landscape variables and wireworm damage ratings were described by Spearman correlations coefficients. Our results showed that wireworm damage was higher in region 2 than in region 1 and tended to be higher in soils with higher sand content. Among the tested landscape variables only landscape composition, especially grassy field margins were significantly positively correlated with wireworm damage at the 25 ha scale. In areas with high proportion of such grassy habitats, farmers should pay more attention to field characteristics, such as sand content in soil, and management, like crop rotation. Further investigations on appropriate management regimes for grassy landscape elements suppressing wireworm populations but ensuring the maintenance of natural pest control should be conducted.",86,1,41,51,Agriculture; Soil water; Crop rotation; Habitat; Ecology; Infestation; Context (language use); Pest control; Agronomy; Arable land; Biology,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10340-012-0444-z https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10340-012-0444-z https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10340-012-0444-z.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10340-012-0444-z/fulltext.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-012-0444-z,,10.1007/s10340-012-0444-z,2025542013,,0,003-995-290-828-321; 006-394-945-371-082; 010-126-263-188-487; 011-433-452-202-125; 011-508-246-956-659; 012-142-323-248-65X; 014-888-694-079-078; 015-107-071-332-614; 015-578-334-267-852; 015-611-720-732-777; 015-832-718-411-500; 016-571-213-197-872; 016-946-499-551-053; 021-957-424-591-258; 024-624-225-746-492; 025-446-079-138-022; 025-908-335-264-823; 026-444-912-413-82X; 027-169-272-591-400; 027-381-119-916-238; 027-628-996-379-595; 028-237-504-948-367; 029-863-423-297-632; 031-114-644-626-51X; 035-533-140-870-529; 039-525-080-217-207; 040-189-250-401-96X; 046-273-480-177-422; 046-851-860-385-698; 047-177-380-099-427; 047-711-433-977-172; 050-589-307-019-063; 053-882-087-587-342; 055-083-398-263-398; 056-101-024-270-22X; 056-892-630-404-500; 058-105-561-757-413; 061-825-091-176-860; 062-036-445-726-722; 062-478-277-322-013; 063-826-571-279-663; 063-948-998-496-486; 066-347-110-782-638; 069-625-234-372-637; 070-194-102-378-889; 070-275-873-799-643; 074-980-927-373-605; 076-698-921-796-504; 091-621-633-524-14X; 092-220-232-726-188; 095-688-796-245-008; 104-591-767-409-302; 116-474-491-174-399; 121-239-766-838-619; 125-845-033-806-594; 130-293-828-310-486; 133-151-672-327-358; 141-216-456-057-888; 141-759-936-693-745; 142-547-556-180-595; 145-557-121-670-315; 148-355-663-730-312; 150-761-385-310-830; 158-758-956-255-657; 166-160-872-451-70X; 166-801-044-851-502; 177-255-053-495-769; 190-066-299-383-44X,29

Succession of predacious arthropods and long-term change in the ratio of phytophagous and predacious arthropods in a meadow.,,1988,journal article,Oecologia,14321939; 00298549,Springer Verlag,Germany,Wolfgang Nentwig,"A 5-year-field experiment was performed in a meadow to test the effect of strip-management (small unmown strips alternating with broad mown strips, Fig. 1) on the abundance and composition of arthropods. The species number and density of most predator groups increased from year to year. The succession (parallel to the development of the unmown strips) favoured more specialized species, so that the initial pioneer species become less abundant in consecutive years. In spiders, this succession leads from a dominance of Linyphiidae to a dominance of Lycosidae; the spider biomass increases and probably predator pressure by spiders is augmented. The stability of the predator community (measured as the variance of their frequency in successive years) is higher than that of the phytophagous groups. Under strip-managed conditions the abundance (""activity density"") of most arthropod groups decreases by an average of ca. 12%. The trophic levels, however, are affected to different extents and strong species-specific preferences were found as well. These combined effects lead to constant increase in the ratio of predacious and parasitic to phytophagous insects in the strip-managed area and probably lead also to an increase of the predator pressure facing phytophagous insects. Strip-management is discussed as an important technique among integrated methods for the biological control of pests.",76,4,597,606,Ecological succession; Dominance (ecology); Predation; Ecology; Pioneer species; Arthropod; Linyphiidae; Thomisidae; Biology; Predator,Augmentation; Integrated control; Pest species; Predators; Succession,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28312414 https://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF00397876 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28312414/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00317463 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992Oecol..92..373L/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00397876,28312414,10.1007/bf00397876,2575491483,,0,000-271-857-070-759; 001-088-667-324-317; 002-066-707-341-779; 006-418-785-240-182; 011-257-824-696-294; 015-888-533-237-30X; 016-823-705-101-257; 018-053-273-348-76X; 019-286-238-463-002; 021-199-110-991-742; 023-851-975-669-59X; 028-397-682-880-417; 030-100-085-449-647; 030-617-236-176-116; 031-908-069-503-20X; 033-676-115-801-092; 033-985-992-182-966; 035-512-326-342-385; 036-272-003-057-180; 036-360-672-726-628; 037-036-513-095-891; 037-241-390-682-529; 039-534-821-372-357; 047-898-549-829-481; 050-435-283-155-72X; 050-797-916-953-579; 050-969-624-770-832; 051-103-549-479-234; 053-343-090-208-443; 053-716-625-930-483; 054-620-396-640-705; 054-811-263-360-808; 056-892-041-411-85X; 057-612-922-967-628; 057-810-730-276-416; 058-336-713-824-813; 059-675-501-993-001; 063-188-123-207-582; 063-462-894-493-416; 064-517-943-544-93X; 064-801-766-071-93X; 065-957-112-427-869; 067-680-789-295-902; 067-731-709-518-748; 073-233-781-459-995; 073-852-992-763-498; 085-942-359-788-758; 090-414-638-170-776; 093-525-655-948-608; 096-974-408-461-061; 104-486-688-800-27X; 111-210-309-571-443; 115-814-436-354-989; 117-283-512-278-870; 123-078-101-362-001; 134-890-565-889-22X; 135-415-442-592-411; 139-131-331-021-30X; 142-393-032-994-329; 162-206-053-615-649; 162-474-555-472-781; 165-518-954-784-441; 167-884-087-005-405; 168-458-339-894-814; 181-030-964-660-195; 183-754-500-909-067; 188-287-165-134-656; 189-235-406-181-392; 194-482-255-430-935,136

The aim of this study was to estimate the dispersal success of forest-dwelling plants from a stand into and along an attached woody corridor, and to explain the observed patterns from the point of view of species’ dispersal traits and corridor properties. We sampled 47 forest–corridor transects in the agricultural landscapes of southeastern Estonia. Regionally common forest-dwelling species (observed in at least 10 % of seed-source forests) were classified on the basis of their ecological response profile—forest-restricted species (F-type) and forest-dwelling generalists (G-type). Species richness and the proportion of F-type species decreased sharply from the seed-source forest core to the forest edge and to the first 10–15 m of the corridor, while G-type species richness remained constant throughout the transect. Corridor structure had a species-specific effect—F species were promoted by old (≥50 years) and wide (≥10 m) corridors, while G species were supported by young and narrow corridors with ditch-related soil disturbances. Moderate shade (canopy cover <75 %) was optimal for all forest-dwelling species. Large dispersule weight, and not seed weight, dispersal vector or Ellenberg’s indicator values, was the trait that differentiated F species from G species. We conclude that most woody corridors are only dispersal stepping-stone habitats for habitat generalist species, and not for specialists. Only century old corridors can relieve the dispersal limitation of forest-restricted species.",214,3,455,470,Species distribution; Seed dispersal; Habitat; Ecology; Wildlife corridor; Dispersal vector; Generalist and specialist species; Biological dispersal; Species richness; Biology,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11258-013-0182-1 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11258-013-0182-1.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-013-0182-1,,10.1007/s11258-013-0182-1,2001084569,,0,000-028-962-557-075; 000-575-209-961-337; 002-569-195-367-776; 007-221-361-423-978; 007-842-072-048-27X; 007-942-930-508-462; 014-161-096-853-425; 017-943-669-463-869; 018-023-127-841-209; 018-463-393-074-304; 018-780-961-972-719; 019-620-620-455-821; 020-938-492-722-870; 021-907-377-633-412; 022-848-213-712-156; 030-185-440-082-022; 035-051-512-271-972; 036-722-726-289-60X; 038-161-345-680-90X; 038-361-105-216-688; 039-524-631-746-697; 041-469-176-773-812; 042-530-992-835-782; 044-847-682-877-803; 046-559-721-405-224; 047-288-579-303-247; 051-197-969-663-775; 051-693-696-025-120; 056-853-001-254-085; 063-207-503-700-767; 068-143-605-669-192; 068-251-487-388-581; 071-601-864-758-089; 073-170-131-117-322; 075-235-467-560-472; 076-208-799-863-720; 092-338-002-097-519; 092-697-296-797-661; 100-283-244-414-903; 108-586-996-670-001; 109-162-269-116-845; 114-338-851-242-14X; 141-005-140-982-524; 149-223-438-699-672; 149-673-684-724-149; 156-624-196-949-616; 168-592-107-353-063; 172-560-580-560-47X; 176-543-809-298-678,22

How does the structure of field boundaries determine the composition of vegetation? Location: Estonia, six 4 km × 4 km agricultural areas. Methods: We studied the vegetation of fields and field boundaries using 2 m × 2 m sample plots. We estimated the frequency of species in both habitat types, applied an MRPP test to analyse the vegetation composition of field boundaries with various combinations of landscape features (ditches, roads, tree and bush layers) illustrating this by DCA ordination, and used indicator species analysis to determine the characteristic species of each boundary type. Results: Ca. 45% of the flora of field boundaries comprised species found on agricultural land. Most typical species in fields – agrotolerants – were also the most common in field boundaries. The vegetation of road verges and grassy boundaries consisted mainly of disturbance-tolerant species.

Woodcock; Duncan B. Westbury; Thomas Tscheulin; Jenifer Harrison-Cripps; Stephanie J. Harris; Alex J. Ramsey; Valerie K. Brown; Simon G. Potts,"Beetle assemblages and their response to plant community composition and architectural structure were monitored from 2002 to 2006 within arable field margins. Field margins were sown with either tussock grass and forbs, fine grass and forbs or grass only seed mixtures. After an establishment year, field margins were managed using standard sward cuts, scarification, or graminicide application. For predatory beetles, overall density was greatest where tussock grasses were included within the seed mixtures, while the densities of phytophagous beetles were greatest where forbs were present. Unexpectedly, species rarefaction curves suggested that phytophagous beetle species richness was greatest where field margins were established using a grass only seed mixture. The structure of the beetle assemblages, i.e., the relative abundances of individual species, was largely dependent on seed mixture, although margin management also played an important role. The results suggest that field margins established using seed mixtures containing tussock grasses and forbs would be expected to provide the greatest resources for beetles, at least at local scales. However, the use of a single standardised seed mixture for margin establishment would result in a homogenisation of beetle assemblages at a regional scale",125,1-4,246,254,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2008.01.004,,10.1016/j.agee.2008.01.004,,,0,003-460-280-575-85X; 019-123-430-272-496; 020-024-935-817-641; 025-983-895-963-761; 030-453-266-652-445; 047-946-954-821-823; 056-585-869-238-25X; 060-303-879-790-212; 081-749-104-701-059; 110-673-327-117-273; 111-870-809-427-521; 117-345-687-903-78X; 179-048-991-295-983,31

Two of the shelterbelts in question were of the single-row type. The remaining two consisted of at least two rows of deciduous trees and in both cases some conifers. Wind measurements were made under various weather conditions, both in winter and in summer. The minimum relative wind speed on the lee side varied from ca 0.1 behind the most dense shelterbelt to 0.4 behind the most porous one when the wind was blowing at right angles in summer. In the winter, the shelter effect was much less than in the summer but the two most dense shelterbelts did reduce the wind speed considerably also then. When the wind was blowing at an angle to the shelterbelt, the lee maximum occurred closer to the belt and the wind speed recovered faster than when it blew at right angles. The wind reduction just behind a shelterbelt always tended to be greater in oblique than in perpendicular wind. The wind reduction behind a leafy vegetation belt decreased as the reference wind speed increased. The approach wind speed affected wind reduction much more at a porous shelterbelt than at a dense one. The difference between reference and local wind directions could be great just behind a shelterbelt but this difference disappeared within a few h downstream of the belt. With further increasing distance (up to 4–11h), the wind continued to veer so that the direction became more parallel with the shelterbelt than in the case of the undisturbed wind. Then the wind slowly veered back to the direction of the approaching wind again. The present data give a good idea of the amount of wind reduction which can be expected in the lee of some common types of shelterbelts.",54,4,363,385,Wind direction; Relative wind; Windbreak; Meteorology; Wind speed; Vegetation; Field (physics); Deciduous; Environmental science; Right angle,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991BoLMe..54..363N/abstract https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00118867,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00118867,,10.1007/bf00118867,1999161612,,0,008-778-194-636-419; 044-790-428-858-696; 101-747-440-467-243; 109-589-023-105-532; 114-235-928-227-676; 147-210-182-148-301; 153-952-725-316-069,54

To quantify temporal variations in P and nitrogen (N) contents of the grassy vegetation of BZs on a clay soil (Vertic Cambisol) in south-western Finland, plant samples were collected six times between May 2005 and April 2006 from natural BZs, BZs grazed by cattle and BZs harvested by cutting and removal of the yield. The total dry weight biomass peaked in early August at 2,130–2,360 and 5,500–6,270 kg ha−1 for the grazed and the other BZs, respectively. In August, 3,840–4,830 kg ha−1 were removed from the harvested BZs while the entire biomass of the non-harvested BZs remained in the field. In October, total P and N contents varied from 2.4–10.2 to 19–72 kg ha−1, respectively, the lowest amounts being for the young harvested BZ and the highest for the non-harvested BZs. A considerable decrease of P and N contents occurred in the biomass up to 6.1 and almost 30 kg ha−1, respectively, after the first frosts. Harvesting of BZs is recommended to decrease the amount of P and N in the BZs and reduce the risk of P and N leaching outside the growing season.",86,1,121,132,Biomass (ecology); Leaching (agriculture); Growing season; Dry weight; Vegetation; Cambisol; Environmental science; Nitrogen cycle; Phosphorus; Agronomy,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103068004 https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/publications/phosphorus-and-nitrogen-cycles-in-the-vegetation-of-differently-m https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10705-009-9277-4 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103068004.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10705-009-9277-4/fulltext.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-009-9277-4,,10.1007/s10705-009-9277-4,2092717380,,0,004-807-427-288-860; 007-207-212-071-568; 009-014-157-130-300; 010-499-008-581-398; 011-288-274-938-632; 017-420-773-610-643; 018-253-057-463-110; 025-905-582-116-875; 034-748-846-517-673; 040-105-031-136-536; 040-307-605-347-582; 042-271-021-425-971; 052-012-557-275-250; 058-555-746-979-598; 066-008-497-105-394; 072-307-357-826-584; 076-826-572-086-275; 077-418-118-294-000; 081-797-255-967-635; 086-998-165-612-358; 088-236-621-248-724; 095-517-803-094-206; 102-085-103-343-879; 102-278-004-674-892; 102-307-069-255-349; 112-747-273-878-051; 115-561-236-725-922; 123-547-078-308-929; 125-434-585-806-174; 142-455-509-676-637; 155-077-672-111-552; 176-609-653-505-894; 187-118-162-708-884; 188-364-853-127-608,38

Lack,The effects on the bird population of a drastic cutback of all the internal hedges on a farm in central England were studied using the Common Birds Census mapping method. Numbers of hedgerow bird species were reduced after the cutback and it was birds along the affected hedges that were lost. Their numbers subsequently showed a full or partial recovery. In the year after the cutback birds of 5 of the most widespread and abundant hedgerow species on British farms temporarily packed some extra territories into unaffected hedges around the edge of the farm. The implications of the increased packing on the carrying capacity of farmland are briefly discussed.,34,2,139,146,Carrying capacity; Hedge (finance); Population; Census; Agroforestry; Biology,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00063658709476951,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063658709476951,,10.1080/00063658709476951,2037390070,,0,006-174-981-795-443; 006-969-689-421-515; 029-904-475-177-008; 030-388-683-032-986; 054-166-168-406-223; 110-766-047-364-379,53

Danielson; James R. Brandle; Laurie Hodges; P. Srinivas,"The bean leaf beetle, Cerotoma trifurcata (Forster) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is a major insect pest of soybean in Nebraska and throughout much of the Midwest. This insect overwinters in the adult stage in litter in wooded areas such as shelterbelts. Historically, crop producers have been unsure of the merits of shelterbelts, especially if nearby crops are more likely to be infested by insect pests as a result. In this study, bean leaf beetle adults were sampled during the season by visually counting the number of beetles found on soybean plants early in the season and by sweep net sampling once plants were at the V4 stage (approximately 0.33 m tall). Sampling was done in 1997 and 1998 at the University of Nebraska Agricultural Research and Development Center in Saunders Co. in east-central Nebraska. Beetle counts were compared between shelterbelt-protected and -unprotected fields. In general. bean leaf beetles were more numerous in 1997 than in 1998, with abundance peaks occurring in late-July and early-September in both years. There were significant differences in bean leaf beetle counts from protected and unprotected fields on only three of the 11 and four of the 13 sampling dates in 1997 and 1998, respectively. On the sampling dates when significant differences were found, two of three in 1997 and three of four in 1998 had higher bean leaf beetle abundance in the protected soybean fields. The results of this study indicate a tendency for more bean leaf beetles in shelterbelt-protected soybean fields when differences are found, but beetle numbers were not significantly different between protected and unprotected fields on the majority of sample dates in the two years of this study. This study also reconfirms the presence of two generations of the bean leaf beetle in Nebraska.",35,4,385,390,Crop; Windbreak; PEST analysis; Leaf beetle; Insect; Cerotoma trifurcata; Litter; Agronomy; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/agronomyfacpub/371/ https://meridian.allenpress.com/jes/article/35/4/385/77134/Bean-Leaf-Beetle-Coleoptera-Chrysomelidae https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1371&context=agronomyfacpub https://core.ac.uk/display/17237092 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20013014632 https://works.bepress.com/laurie_hodges/48/download/ https://core.ac.uk/download/17237092.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.18474/0749-8004-35.4.385,,10.18474/0749-8004-35.4.385,140177812,,0,006-748-042-685-14X; 009-306-296-135-325; 015-863-314-524-72X; 031-301-266-670-743; 034-342-684-051-494; 037-776-264-348-117; 045-186-508-102-982; 051-496-666-553-296; 057-879-278-560-124; 058-667-334-035-191; 073-764-433-877-704; 080-315-973-869-828; 088-498-069-312-023; 097-556-067-865-766; 114-765-340-699-400; 127-584-257-851-757; 165-218-543-348-595; 176-115-952-424-664; 176-603-590-522-170; 195-770-735-462-39X,6

Goel,"Many forms of natural heritage manifested as streams, rivers, ponds, lakes and wetlands play an integral role in maintaining natural beauty, health and a high quality of life. Agricultural intensification in southern Ontario has contributed to elevated sediments, nutrient and bacteria levels in water bodies. Vegetative filter strips (VFS) are control measures that can partially remove sediments and pollutants adhered to sediments from overland runoff before entering water bodies. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of vegetation type, width of the filter strip, runoff flow rate and inflow sediment characteristics on effectiveness of the VFS in removing pollutants from runoff. The results show that sediment removal efficiency increased from 50 to 98% as the width of the filter increased from 2.5 to 20 m. In addition to the width of the filter strip, grass type and flow rate were also significant factors. This study indicates that the first five (5) metres of a filter strip are critical and effective in removal of suspended sediments. More than 95% of the aggregates larger than 40 µm in diameter were trapped within the first five metres of the filter strip.",41,3,275,282,Filter (aquarium); Water quality; Filter strip; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; STREAMS; Surface runoff; Wetland; Pollutant,,,,,https://iwaponline.com/wqrj/article/41/3/275/39820/Effectiveness-of-Vegetative-Filter-Strips-in https://www.cawq.ca/journal/temp/article/313.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wqrj.2006.031,,10.2166/wqrj.2006.031,172945119,,0,007-071-648-273-363; 007-550-413-175-53X; 008-380-052-396-94X; 040-507-938-290-621; 051-851-638-777-86X; 055-590-572-243-787; 061-808-827-942-616; 082-797-391-654-568; 087-168-688-204-963; 108-895-083-009-410; 111-288-588-656-115; 115-642-860-718-878; 118-928-212-112-766; 128-756-255-940-507; 148-021-978-074-372; 183-143-735-590-924; 197-430-645-554-460,55

S. Tilak; Michael R. Burchell; Mohamed A. Youssef; Richard Lowrance; R.G. Williams,"The riparian ecosystem management model (REMM) was field tested using five years (2005-2009) of measured hydrologic and water quality data on a riparian buffer located in the Tar-Pamlico River Basin, North Carolina. The buffer site received NO3-N loading from an agricultural field that was fertilized with inorganic fertilizer. Field results showed the buffer reduced groundwater NO3-N concentration moving to the stream over a five-year period. REMM was calibrated hydrologically using daily field-measured water table depths (WTDs), and with monthly NO3-N concentrations in groundwater wells. Results showed simulated WTDs and NO3-N concentrations in good agreement with measured values. The mean absolute error and Willmott's index of agreement for WTDs varied from 13-45 cm and 0.72-0.92, respectively, while the root mean square error and Willmott's index of agreement for NO3-N concentrations ranged from 1.04-5.92 mg/l and 0.1-0.86, respectively, over the five-year period. REMM predicted plant nitrogen (N) uptake and denitrification were within ranges reported in other riparian buffer field studies. The calibrated and validated REMM was used to simulate 33 years of buffer performance at the site. Results showed that on average the buffer reduced NO3-N concentrations from 12 mg/l at the field edge to 0.7 mg/l at the stream edge over the simulation period, while the total N and NO3-N load reductions from the field edge to the stream were 77 and 82%, respectively.",50,3,665,682,Riparian zone; Drainage basin; Nonpoint source pollution; Coastal plain; Riparian buffer; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science; Water table; Groundwater,,,,NC Department of Environment and Natural Resources; Division of Soil and Water Conservation and the NC Clean Water Management,https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jawr.12208 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014JAWRA..50..665T/abstract https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/en/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=201402236327183660,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jawr.12208,,10.1111/jawr.12208,1982067358,,0,003-444-257-201-665; 010-555-419-610-628; 011-404-593-793-237; 012-529-474-262-279; 013-158-601-419-635; 013-606-152-994-437; 013-624-739-519-028; 015-325-416-202-141; 015-342-032-824-51X; 015-385-795-850-37X; 015-514-563-181-208; 017-208-620-781-187; 021-264-049-632-756; 027-089-714-082-495; 038-212-470-117-38X; 040-665-244-257-257; 044-948-727-495-773; 047-315-074-139-26X; 049-377-460-200-299; 049-435-099-390-089; 053-898-259-622-631; 062-480-530-262-476; 064-195-162-313-451; 064-493-407-513-458; 073-703-019-282-474; 077-207-930-721-018; 083-268-336-005-496; 085-526-659-612-823; 087-138-533-405-771; 088-361-051-609-534; 090-167-224-970-495; 093-044-336-525-221; 095-037-744-054-26X; 100-845-850-323-114; 107-148-469-482-379; 111-064-941-380-808; 113-812-122-120-192; 115-135-081-904-990; 121-468-243-703-60X; 126-276-377-317-910; 128-151-405-108-555; 130-737-129-105-533; 141-101-347-131-583; 142-910-363-410-618; 165-869-969-742-492; 167-727-819-454-347; 174-885-636-304-538; 180-616-843-377-184,10

Prentice; Karin Hall; Henrik G. Smith; Ola Olsson,"Uncultivated field margins are one of the most frequent non-crop habitat types in contemporary, highintensity agricultural landscapes and may therefore be important for the persistence of many farmland species. Managing field margins in a way that preserves, and preferably enhances, their value for biodiversity is therefore important. In the present study, we evaluate how the flora of uncultivated field margins is affected by the removal of woody vegetation as prescribed by an agri-environment scheme (AES) under the Swedish Rural Development Program 2007–2013. We used generalized linear mixed models and detrended correspondence analysis to compare the flora of open (cleared) and more overgrown field margins, located within agricultural landscapes of different complexity, in Scania, S. Sweden. As expected, there was a negative effect of management on woody species. However, the local (1m2) and transect (100 m) level richness of non-woody species did not differ significantly between management categories, and there were no differences in the within-transect variability of non-woody species (local b diversity) or the species composition (0.25m2 plots) in managed and unmanaged field margins. Our results show that the removal of woody vegetation from uncultivated field margins, as prescribed by the evaluated AES, is unlikely to benefit non-woody plant species. The species composition of the sampled field margins suggests that inclusion of appropriate field layer management alone is unlikely to be sufficient to improve habitat conditions for grassland species unless measures are taken to counteract eutrophication. Landscape type, on the other hand, influenced both the total richness and the richness of each of the species groups that were considered to be of particular conservation value in the present study: field margins in the complex agricultural landscapes were significantly richer than those in the simple ones. Maintaining non-crop habitat at the landscape scale is likely to be a necessary first step in the prevention of a further decline of farmland plants.

Langan; Nikolai Friberg,"The Tarland Catchment Initiative is a partnership venture between researchers, land managers, regulators, and the local community. Its aims are to improve water quality, promote biodiversity, and increase awareness of catchment management. In this study, the effects of buffer strip installations and remediation of a large septic tank effluent were appraised by water physico-chemistry (suspended solids, NO3, NH4, soluble reactive P) and stream macroinvertebrate indices used by the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency. It was done during before and after interventions over an 8-yr period using a paired catchment approach. Because macroinvertebrate indices were previously shown to respond negatively to suspended solid concentrations in the study area, the installation of buffer strips along the headwaters was expected to improve macroinvertebrate scores. Although water quality (soluble reactive P, NH4) improved downstream of the septic tank effluent after remediation, there was no detectable change in macroinvertebrate scores. Buffer strip installations in the headwaters had no measurable effects (beyond possible weak trends) on water quality or macroinvertebrate scores. Either the buffer strips have so far been ineffective or ineffectiveness of assessment methods and sampling frequency and time lags in recovery prevent us detecting reliable effects. To explain and appreciate these constraints on measuring stream recovery, continuous capacity building with land managers and other stakeholders is essential; otherwise, the feasibility of undertaking sufficient management interventions is likely to be compromised and projects deemed unsuccessful.",41,2,314,321,Drainage basin; Effluent; Suspended solids; Septic tank; Water quality; Assessment methods; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Environmental remediation; Water resource management; Environmental engineering,,"Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources/methods; Geologic Sediments/chemistry; Invertebrates/drug effects; Rivers/chemistry; Time Factors; Waste Management; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis; Water Quality","Water Pollutants, Chemical",Scottish Government Rural and Environment Research and Analysis Directorate; COST Action 869,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:448464 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2134/jeq2010.0537 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22370393 http://swepub.kb.se/bib/swepub:oai:DiVA.org:liu-71280?language=en https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22370393/ https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2134/jeq2010.0537,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2010.0537,22370393,10.2134/jeq2010.0537,2085305712,,0,003-726-020-963-114; 006-035-750-496-374; 009-512-707-884-476; 009-895-949-756-902; 010-770-157-236-067; 011-881-682-823-073; 012-960-567-987-63X; 013-334-567-452-182; 014-281-715-418-059; 015-256-006-013-114; 016-498-827-017-786; 017-852-066-371-654; 018-917-776-001-974; 020-284-310-976-467; 021-295-006-788-082; 021-406-452-425-58X; 024-268-349-625-897; 026-241-364-938-640; 026-988-011-549-709; 028-080-302-921-825; 028-798-221-492-320; 029-264-530-643-997; 029-288-298-643-699; 036-297-570-426-879; 044-400-539-268-721; 046-824-906-951-832; 047-920-434-433-346; 050-600-089-251-861; 052-257-572-825-068; 061-401-711-406-024; 062-760-368-888-599; 063-240-933-136-996; 066-449-563-675-066; 077-806-418-364-116; 084-146-419-139-132; 086-555-522-851-97X; 086-865-598-090-349; 091-834-790-404-52X; 096-196-209-039-855; 097-418-911-450-457; 105-251-527-272-453; 110-456-431-007-145; 113-698-991-711-756; 113-994-438-709-147; 117-057-266-688-704; 117-275-347-415-615; 119-058-102-527-581; 123-799-434-066-956; 129-514-064-370-948; 133-033-009-404-727; 133-786-282-373-091; 136-476-812-223-249; 143-082-913-095-348; 145-469-040-958-552; 148-468-520-956-729; 149-043-856-022-56X; 156-434-870-809-061; 166-800-950-364-680; 172-097-874-551-411; 190-128-048-622-830,28

Paine; Christine A. Ribic,"Riparian plant community composition is influenced by moisture, erosion, original native plant communities, and current and past land use. This study compared riparian plant communities under four types of management: woody buffer strip, grassy buffer strip, rotational grazing, and continuous grazing. Study sites were located along spring-fed streams in the unglaciated region of southwestern Wisconsin, USA. At each site, plant community surveys were conducted using a point transect method. Among the treatments, woody buffer strips, rotationally grazed and continuously grazed riparian areas had greater plant species richness than grassy buffer strips, and woody buffer strips had the greatest native plant species richness. Reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) was prevalent in grassy buffer strips (44% of all observations), common in woody buffer strips (15%), and rare in sites that were rotationally or continuously grazed (3 and 5%, respectively). Pasture sites had greater proportions of native grasses and grass relatives and moderate levels of overall native species richness. Considered a water quality best management practice, well-managed rotational grazing may be a reasonable alternative to buffer strips which can contribute to protection and enhancement of native vegetation biodiversity.",92,1,93,105,Riparian zone; Vegetation; Native plant; Ecology; Buffer zone; Phalaris arundinacea; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Plant community; Species richness; Agronomy,,,,,http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70024217 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880901002699 https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70024217 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880901002699,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-8809(01)00269-9,,10.1016/s0167-8809(01)00269-9,2078147650,,0,016-461-409-775-585; 016-948-002-430-221; 018-907-073-945-38X; 028-455-082-855-472; 034-461-301-281-56X; 035-373-270-460-114; 038-620-116-257-26X; 038-659-320-814-260; 039-066-315-891-993; 042-664-878-568-311; 043-375-289-349-28X; 043-449-458-648-440; 053-055-528-157-884; 057-191-112-701-980; 061-098-152-686-453; 068-997-932-046-194; 075-781-408-578-136; 081-934-038-168-499; 090-434-065-856-305; 098-004-631-148-428; 106-184-521-213-152; 116-694-649-287-604; 120-201-114-969-445; 124-362-582-173-520; 129-199-839-535-924; 132-380-117-709-640; 164-502-760-111-254; 177-058-284-780-505,55

Wäckers,"Hoverflies with zoophagous larvae are among the most common natural enemies of pests in Dutch arable fields. Their effectiveness is partly limited by the availability of nectar and pollen for the adults. In this study we examined the suitability of flowers of ca. 30 plant species as food source for the common Episyrphus balteatus, both with choice tests and with non-choice survival tests. Many common field margin flowers appear to be unsuitable, as they do not allow the hoverflies to survive up to their reproductive age. The results can well be explained by flower morphology: only flowers with nectar available at a depth of less than 2 mm are suitable. Choice tests indicate that the hoverflies mainly select flowers with accessible nectar. Moreover, field studies showed that field margins with a higher proportion of flowers with accessible nectar attract higher numbers of zoophagous hoverflies. These results stress the importance of laboratory bioassays for selecting the right plants for functional field margins.",56,,125,128,Nectar source; Nectar; Nectar guide; Larva; Ecology; Episyrphus balteatus; Pollen; Natural enemies; Agronomy; Plant morphology; Biology,,,,,http://dare.uva.nl/document/2/88943 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adare.uva.nl%3Apublications%2Fb7a06eda-43e6-458a-8e84-766e99f56bca https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20113134394.html https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20113134394 https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/1004051/88943_VanRijn_IOBC_2010.pdf https://www.uva.nl/binaries/content/documents/personalpages/r/i/p.c.j.vanrijn/en/tab-four/tab-four/cpitem%5B15%5D/asset?1355373686282,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adare.uva.nl%3Apublications%2Fb7a06eda-43e6-458a-8e84-766e99f56bca,,,1897528950,,0,012-466-311-051-172; 086-402-015-642-906; 094-645-205-628-669; 118-476-406-162-361; 122-418-676-349-862,8

Dillaha; R. B. Reneau; Saied Mostaghimi; D. Lee,"ABSTRACT Arainfall simulator was used to evaluate the effective-ness of vegetative filter strips (VFS) for the removal of sediment, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) from cropland runoff. Simulated rainfall was applied to nine experimental field plots on an eroded Groseclose silt loam soil (clayey, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalt) with a 5.5 by 18.3 m bare cropland source area and either a 0, 4.6, or 9.1 m VFS located at the lower end of each plot. Fertilizers were applied to the plots at rates of 222 kg/ha of liquid N and 112 kg/ha of P2O5 and K2O. Water samples were collected from the base of each plot and analyzed for sediment and nutrient content. One set of plots was constructed to encourage concentrated rather than shallow uniform flow. The 9.1 and 4.6 m VFS with shallow uniform flow removed an average of 84 and 70% of the incoming suspended solids, 79 and 61% of the incoming P, and 73 and 54% of the incoming N, respectively. Soluble nutrients in the filter effluent were sometimes greater than the incoming soluble nutrient load, presumably due to lower removal efficiencies for soluble nutrients and the release of nutrients previously trapped in the filters. Concentrations of soluble inorganic N and P in filter strip effluent were sufficient to cause eutrophic plant growth in aquatic ecosystems. Observation of existing VFS showed that on-farm VFS were not likely to be as effective as experimental VFS because of problems with flow concentrations.",32,2,513,0519,Loam; Nutrient; Eutrophication; Suspended solids; Filter strip; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Phosphorus,,,,,https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/10012139944 https://elibrary.asabe.org/abstract.asp?aid=31033,http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/2013.31033,,10.13031/2013.31033,2009988050,,0,,616

Aims To assess the importance for breeding birds of key habitat elements, such as isolated shrubs, hedgerows and untilled vegetation patches. Methods We investigated the habitat preferences of Red-backed Shrikes Lanius collurio in an agricultural environment where key habitat elements have been dramatically reduced. Based upon data from territorial maps, a fine-scale model of habitat preference was developed and the results of three different analytical approaches (binary logistic regression, multimodel inference and hierarchical partitioning) were compared. Results The occurrence of Red-backed Shrikes was positively influenced by the extent of non-grazed/mown grassland, isolated bushes and hedgerows, and negatively influenced by woodland cover. The model highlighted the importance of bushes/hedgerows despite their very scarce occurrence in the study areas (overall, average cover only 7.94%).

Hamon; Philippe Merot,"Linear vegetation structures such as hedge tree networks (hedgerows), shelterbelts, and isolated trees play a major role on soil water transfer. Our objective is to evaluate the influence of a bottomland hedgerow on water flux in the saturated and unsaturated zones. Soil water movement was investigated in a hillslope crossed by a hedgerow using total water-potential gradients and shallow groundwater dynamics. Results of a dry year were presented by Ghazavi et al. (2008). In this study, we analyse a wet year and then compare the two contrasting years (dry and wet). During the 2 years, the soil located at the vicinity of the hedgerow developed a drier status than the surrounding soils. Water flux in the unsaturated zone was directed towards the hedgerow for a longer period during the dry year than the wet year. The duration of delayed rewetting of the soil decreased from 3 months for the dry year to 1 month for the wet year. Variation in water storage calculated over the study period was highest near the hedgerow and lowest far from the hedgerow.; ; ; ; In the hillslope studied, hedgerow and stream proximity controlled water transfer. It is clear that the hedgerow controlled water transfer in the unsaturated zone throughout the year, except for the period when the soil profile was fully saturated. First, hedgerows control water transfer by increasing lateral transfer, which is related to high soil water potential gradients in its vicinity. These processes may increase capillary rise and decrease groundwater recharge near the hedgerow. Second, reverse hydraulic gradient (upward flux of water) occurred during the period of lowest groundwater level, mainly because of groundwater and stream connectivity. Processes related to hedgerow presence, such as delayed soil rewetting and flow towards the hedgerow need to be considered to quantify the impact of linear vegetation structures on water flux.

Renwick; Xavier Lambin,"Field voles (Microtus agrestis) were trapped in 14 field margins and their behavioural and demographic parameters measured. Strong support was found for thresholds in margin width below which vole abundance was extremely low. Narrow margins were male biased with individuals moving greater distances and a large proportion of males behaved as transient individuals. However, no effect was observed on the age structure or survival of the population. Individuals were able to compensate for the lack of habitat through alterations in their behaviour sufficiently to maintain their survival. Within intensive agro-ecosystems, narrow strips between crops are important links for voles between wider margins and, if available, other more suitable habitats. Maintenance of narrow margins, along with larger areas of suitable habitat, is therefore effective in farmed landscapes for sustaining populations of specialist species where they show sufficient flexibility.",144,1,364,369,Habitat fragmentation; Habitat; Ecology; Vole; Microtus; Population; Generalist and specialist species; Habitat destruction; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:337039 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880911003409 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880911003409 https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/abundance-thresholds-and-the-underlying-ecological-processes-fiel,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2011.10.006,,10.1016/j.agee.2011.10.006,2039768745,,0,000-631-705-643-921; 004-385-804-491-091; 006-520-018-288-928; 008-225-619-668-580; 012-684-029-723-807; 013-343-243-425-254; 014-224-372-598-009; 017-072-918-377-072; 022-609-146-511-814; 024-924-476-251-122; 031-592-787-048-258; 034-454-770-195-458; 041-728-890-038-763; 041-947-413-095-773; 042-105-005-534-541; 042-659-087-674-373; 048-465-576-777-042; 051-715-031-208-664; 053-444-911-918-542; 054-715-078-148-813; 056-064-713-708-207; 058-039-285-479-935; 060-114-103-966-089; 065-056-436-186-59X; 066-146-818-277-644; 068-204-559-077-802; 068-452-604-669-157; 073-729-418-796-355; 077-032-593-393-217; 083-935-486-669-294; 088-798-922-659-978; 089-098-407-824-325; 089-131-658-809-957; 089-257-427-127-83X; 093-501-924-946-904; 095-877-317-702-391; 108-625-646-975-939; 124-639-873-005-403; 127-321-634-632-513; 140-473-846-131-917; 144-511-948-092-98X; 145-460-316-879-599; 147-312-511-790-870; 151-220-384-766-419; 152-163-205-417-861; 155-691-175-864-748; 156-867-478-809-60X; 188-198-115-810-367; 195-618-519-387-640,12

During 1990, hedgerows, margins and the centre of the field were sampled using sweep nets. The number of predator-parasitoid specimens and species found in the hedgerows was higher than found in the centre of the field. The wheat-field margins had higher catches of predator-parasitoids than the field centre but lower than the hedgerows. In the alfalfa, the field margins and the field centre had similar catches of predator-parasitoids.

Kulshreshtha; John Kort,"Shelterbelts are a valuable resource to those who plant them and to other members of society. The external benefits to society can be worth as much as the private benefits to producers. However, the external benefits have not been quantified or monetized in a well-documented way. In this study, external benefits were estimated for tree seedlings distributed by the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Shelterbelt Centre in the Canadian Prairie Provinces for the period 1981–2001. Estimation of these benefits required information on the biophysical changes caused by shelterbelts and their valuation. Using literature, we estimated that the value of these external benefits amounted to over $140 million (2001 CDN$; CDN$1 = US$0.63). The majority of this value was derived from carbon sequestration ($73 million) and reduced soil erosion ($15 million) services with the remainder being contributed by biodiversity and water and air quality services. Other external benefits, such as health values, transportation safety, aesthetics and property values were identified but could not be estimated due to a lack of data. The estimated value for external benefits conferred by shelterbelts in this study indicates that they are large and suggests that both private and external benefits need to be considered in formulating policies or programs so that benefits to the society can be maximized.",75,1,39,47,Agriculture; Air quality index; Windbreak; Business; Externality; Valuation (finance); Carbon sequestration; Erosion control; Greenhouse gas; Agricultural economics,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20093035596.html https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093035596 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10457-008-9126-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-008-9126-5,,10.1007/s10457-008-9126-5,1983722296,,0,002-010-539-278-260; 003-811-152-056-432; 018-190-713-192-449; 022-637-119-627-908; 023-840-157-396-055; 027-169-272-591-400; 034-407-584-140-152; 044-623-657-378-698; 060-273-870-395-430; 065-502-339-051-682; 067-258-563-917-066; 109-355-184-086-182; 109-635-255-168-553; 124-557-519-537-416; 134-831-671-333-911; 139-923-059-662-209; 144-536-517-570-16X; 189-991-561-415-762,40

Allaire; Claudia Sylvain; Sébastien F. Lange; Georges Thériault; Pierre Lafrance,"Buffer strips have been widely recognized as to promote infiltration, deposition and sorption of contaminants for protecting surface water against agricultural contamination. However, such strips do not intercept all contaminants, particularly soluble ones. Although preferential flow (PF) has been suggested as one factor among several decreasing the efficiency of buffer strips, the mechanisms involved are not well understood. This project examines buffer strip efficiency at intercepting solutes when subsurface PF occurs. Two soluble sorbed tracers, FD&C Blue #1 and rhodamine WT, were applied on an agricultural sandy loam soil to evaluate the ability of a naturally vegetated buffer strip to intercept soluble contaminants. Rhodamine was applied about 15 m from the creek, while the Blue was applied 15 m to 165 m from the creek. Tracer concentration was measured over a two-year period in both the creek and the buffer strip through soil and water samples. Although the tracers traveled via different pathways, they both quickly moved toward the creek, passing beneath the buffer strip through the soil matrix. Our results demonstrate that the risk of water contamination by soluble contaminants is high in such systems, even when a well-vegetated buffer strip is used. The design of buffer strips should be modified to account for underground bypass, either by using plants that have deep, fine roots that do not favour PF or by adding a filter extending deep underground that can be regularly changed.",10,7,e0131840,,Environmental chemistry; Contamination; Loam; Riparian zone; Infiltration (hydrology); Agricultural soil science; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Sorption; Surface water,,"Crops, Agricultural/physiology; Ecosystem; Quebec; Soil; Solubility; Water",Soil; Water,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PLoSO..1031840A/abstract http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4492607 https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131840 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131840 http://espace.inrs.ca/3797/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4492607/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131840,26147093,10.1371/journal.pone.0131840,2206593315,PMC4492607,0,002-650-706-842-54X; 003-888-081-454-171; 008-380-052-396-94X; 010-815-347-288-18X; 012-264-524-522-980; 019-057-578-554-139; 022-399-045-795-755; 022-449-873-473-500; 024-190-862-372-045; 026-348-638-341-72X; 029-141-106-977-71X; 030-682-084-703-597; 040-198-568-662-726; 041-555-254-486-482; 041-732-017-285-796; 042-663-521-219-456; 044-158-358-466-603; 047-007-063-684-487; 049-955-966-811-144; 050-624-647-762-647; 054-619-304-992-861; 055-432-244-486-305; 057-145-675-395-027; 064-318-710-836-745; 066-008-497-105-394; 066-573-843-549-484; 066-727-776-146-130; 067-273-216-931-563; 070-668-706-767-772; 076-826-572-086-275; 081-708-242-213-466; 086-496-072-727-834; 086-988-131-851-191; 104-494-518-145-022; 110-738-839-772-567; 111-709-671-322-709; 125-508-267-529-721; 128-694-137-906-921; 132-001-064-822-195; 132-485-172-621-503; 139-910-929-305-174; 144-811-503-139-479; 173-909-008-294-073; 183-619-429-646-37X; 184-005-964-550-820; 192-243-514-593-683; 194-300-621-130-773,13

Lys,"Five 1.5 m wide strips were sown in a 8 ha winter cereal field with 50–60 selected flowering herbs and weed species leaving 12, 24 and 36 m between the strips to increase the predatory potential within the field. A remarkable increase in ground beetle activity density and species diversity was observed over three years. In 1991 activity density was significantly higher in the strip-managed area than in an adjacent control area.

Klöppel; W. Kördel; B. Stein,"Abstract Runoff studies with simulated rainfall at an intensity of 14 mm/h were carried out on a mesoplot of 1200 m2 planted with triticale. The herbicides dichlorprop-p, isoproturon, and bifenox were applied to the plots, which had a soil water content of about 30 % [kg/kg]. Runoff in the compressed tractor lanes occurred rapidly, whereas a total runoff over the whole plot started at a total rainfall of 14.0 mm and the initial concentrations of dichlorprop-p and isoproturon were 1400 μg/l. In the total runoff the concentrations ranged from 100 μg/l to 200 μg/l, decreasing with cumulative rainfall. In the second study, experiments with simulated runoff were carried out to investigate the efficiency of a grassed filter strip. Out of a point source water spiked with different concentrations of isoproturon, dichlorprop-p and terbuthylazine flowed with intensities of 400 l/h, 1500 l/h and 2000 l/h. In addition, the grassed filter strip was irrigated with sprinklers with an intensity of about 14 mm/h, which corresponds to its infiltration capacity. The simulated runoff leaving the filter strip was collected and analysed for the herbicides. It was shown that the efficiency of the boundary strip in herbicide retention was mainly due to the infiltration of the runoff in the strip.",35,1-2,129,141,Infiltration (hydrology); Soil water; Terbuthylazine; Bifenox; Dichlorprop; Filter strip; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Environmental engineering; Water pollution,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653597001458 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997Chmsp..35..129K/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0045-6535(97)00145-8,,10.1016/s0045-6535(97)00145-8,2086067376,,0,011-867-685-302-723; 016-374-912-452-382; 024-556-636-186-088; 029-113-226-319-414; 056-525-266-506-572; 064-045-986-621-816; 071-359-553-375-619; 090-577-145-445-395; 095-360-317-113-616; 099-912-473-160-981; 104-953-375-119-002; 124-935-933-238-556,76

Webster; David R. Shaw,"Metolachlor and metribuzin loss in runoff was determined in three soybean tillage systems with and without a 4 by 2 m tall fescue vegetative filter strip. Soil erosion plots were 4 by 22 m with 3 % slope. Regression analysis was used to describe herbicide concentration in runoff, and to deter- mine if vegetative filter strips reduced herbicide concentra- tion. Analysis of covariance indicated no difference in concentration of metolachlor or metribuzin in runoff from the three tillage systems within any vegetative filter strip treatment. Metolachlor loss in 1991 was highest from the no-till monocrop without a vegetative filter strip, and it was 65 g ha-1 or approximately 2% of the amount applied. In 1992 and 1993, the no-till doublecrop had a total loss of 120 and 147 g ha-1, respectively, approximately 4% of the amount applied. Similar results were noted with metribuzin, but total loss was as high as 46 g ha-1 or 11% of the amount applied in 1993 from a no-till doublecrop system without a vegetative filter strip. When a vegetative filter strip was present, losses of metribuzin and metolachlor were reduced over 85% in 1993, and totaled 1.2 and 0.5%, respectively, of the amount applied. The vegetative filter strip reduced herbicide and suspended solids from runoff produced by a conventional-till production system to levels equal to or lower than a no-till doublecrop system.

McCracken; Lorna J. Cole; William Harrison; Duncan Robertson,"The intensity of management of lowland grassland fields in the United Kingdom, coupled with the fact that such grasslands dominate much of the lowland landscape, means that there are now few opportunities for many plants, invertebrates, birds, or mammals to survive. The Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) has investigated whether fencing off the margins of such fields next to watercourses to control diffuse pollution has any positive impacts on biodiversity, based on assessments of vegetation composition and condition and structure of assemblages of invertebrates of importance as foodstuffs to farmland birds. Fencing watercourses increased the abundance of key groups of invertebrates. However, the invertebrate species diversity was not increased unless the margins were ≥ 5.4 m in width. Margins established in the study area to prevent access by livestock to watercourses or to enhance biodiversity are generally ≤ 2.6 m wide and are therefore unlikely to provide conditions for additional invertebrate species to use. The dense, tall swards within such margins are also unlikely to provide foraging opportunities for farmland birds. Management (such as low-intensity grazing by livestock in the margins) is essential to provide the conditions required for these groups, but this could conflict with the diffuse pollution mitigation aims. A compromise is proposed whereby limited autumn/winter grazing by livestock could be used to open the vegetation structure in the margins. Grazing by livestock at that time may be acceptable since it is not occurring in the period of main diffuse pollution concern (i.e., the fecal contamination of watercourses and bathing waters in the spring and summer). It is also essential that a landscape-scale approach is taken, driven by knowledge of the full needs of the species concerned, when deciding where best to target agri-environmental actions aimed at farmland bird conservation.",41,2,355,363,Biodiversity; Vegetation; Geography; Grassland; Riparian buffer; Grazing; Bird conservation; Buffer strip; Fencing; Agroforestry,,"Agriculture/methods; Animals; Biodiversity; Coleoptera/classification; Conservation of Natural Resources/methods; Plants/anatomy & histology; Soil/chemistry; Time Factors; Water Pollution, Chemical/prevention & control",Soil,Scottish Government,https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2134/jeq2010.0532 https://pure.sruc.ac.uk/en/publications/improving-the-farmland-biodiversity-value-of-riparian-buffer-stri https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2134/jeq2010.0532 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22370397,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2010.0532,22370397,10.2134/jeq2010.0532,1985177071,,0,002-900-720-944-007; 003-251-732-418-644; 011-749-985-776-165; 014-204-563-886-62X; 018-202-918-339-630; 018-426-147-707-10X; 019-622-915-734-27X; 020-024-935-817-641; 020-499-086-546-478; 021-419-559-384-303; 029-067-159-542-004; 029-264-530-643-997; 030-766-878-238-058; 030-831-977-852-027; 032-374-633-920-032; 034-922-021-577-840; 044-379-480-034-205; 049-224-085-719-269; 049-346-208-924-920; 051-685-596-945-405; 054-715-078-148-813; 055-730-724-648-110; 056-310-930-873-816; 057-320-496-419-500; 060-303-879-790-212; 061-097-208-498-837; 063-580-919-095-500; 065-941-754-623-005; 068-452-604-669-157; 070-194-102-378-889; 071-245-262-326-969; 071-363-274-178-219; 081-198-292-463-95X; 092-151-348-850-74X; 095-014-169-963-827; 104-230-077-662-702; 105-301-641-863-030; 106-009-107-218-603; 108-396-753-252-799; 122-159-545-592-770; 123-195-638-496-459; 125-665-410-415-022; 125-995-631-935-63X; 150-451-331-765-852; 155-691-175-864-748; 165-804-108-473-473; 169-189-318-034-229; 177-065-972-610-361; 199-433-297-667-317,27

Several published papers demonstrate that integration of shelterbelts with agroecosystems offers positive outcomes, such as better yield, more congenial microclimate, and greater organic matter levels. Nonetheless, soil biological diversity, the driver of greater organic matter levels, has not been convincingly tested and verified yet. In addressing this gap, we measured abundance and diversity of populations of arthropods and fungi in three&lt;br /&gt;11-year old shelterbelts integrated with pasture to determine whether a correlation exists between the abundance of and diversity in populations of arthropods and fungi in two seasons: late autumn-early winter (May&amp;ndash;June 2011) and late winter-early spring (August&amp;ndash;September 2011). Litter from the soil surface and soil from two depths were sampled at increasing distance from the midpoint of shelterbelts for the extraction of arthropods and isolation culturing of fungi. The relationship among distance, depth and biodiversity of different groups of arthropods and fungi was analysed using linear regression. We found that over both seasons arthropod abundance in the litter and soil declined with increasing distance from the midpoint of the shelterbelts, and with soil depth. However, fungi abundance in either season was not affected by proximity to the shelterbelt but increased with greater soil depth. Distance from the shelterbelt midpoints did not bear an impact on the diversity richness of both arthropods and fungi.</jats:p>",58,No. 12,560,568,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17221/12/2012-jfs,,10.17221/12/2012-jfs,,,0,,1

Pitfall traps were used to assess the carabid beetle fauna in mid-summer between 1993 and 1996. Suction sampling was used to assess a wider range of arthropod taxa in June 1994. Pitfall data showed no significant overall effects from plot-type although significant differences in carabid activity-density were found between fields and years. In contrast, suction sampling showed marked differences between the crop, the hedge and the plots with different vegetation structures. There was a significant positive correlation between faunal and floral diversity, with arthropod diversity lowest in the crop, low in the crop edge, higher in the more diverse sown plots and highest in the hedge. Studies of over-wintering arthropods from soil samples revealed similar trends, confirming that arthropods colonised sown margin strips within 11–15 months of establishment. The results indicate that the appropriate scale for using pitfall traps is at the field rather than the plot scale. The introduction of botanically diverse field margin strips is shown to be an important method of increasing the arthropod diversity of semi-natural habitat in farmland.",72,2,131,144,Fauna; Biodiversity; Crop; Vegetation; Ecology; Lolium perenne; Pitfall trap; Arable land; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880998001698,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-8809(98)00169-8,,10.1016/s0167-8809(98)00169-8,2034450683,,0,001-245-537-689-947; 002-890-902-512-882; 003-387-677-522-07X; 011-789-039-750-846; 014-809-297-009-430; 022-070-333-305-083; 030-652-847-337-20X; 031-838-053-329-349; 034-200-514-640-583; 044-050-646-677-718; 047-711-433-977-172; 047-873-926-278-494; 050-435-283-155-72X; 051-103-549-479-234; 053-551-700-281-485; 056-391-120-745-502; 056-892-041-411-85X; 059-361-082-177-816; 060-212-024-680-436; 071-543-579-732-418; 087-186-786-234-321; 088-906-961-006-668; 120-514-812-606-235; 127-623-411-272-825; 145-653-851-729-665,209

Previous research has shown that the annual runoff of each herbicide is typically less than 1 g ha−1. A model for the detection of the return period of rainfall events was recently proposed for a site in the north-eastern Po Valley, Italy. The return period model suggested that most of the herbicide loss by runoff (about 98%) is caused by a few, or even just one, extreme rainfall event with a return period of about 25–27 years, whereas ordinary events (4–5 each year) account for the rest. The present study aims to validate that model by comparing model predictions with the experimental results obtained in the 2010–2011 sampling season (independent test data), and to evaluate the effectiveness of the VFS.

Smith,"1. In intensively farmed agricultural landscapes, many species are confined to very small uncultivated areas such as field margins. However, it has been suggested that these small habitat elements cannot support viable populations of all the species observed there. Instead, species richness and abundance in these small habitat fragments may, at least partly, be dependent on dispersal from larger semi-natural grassland fragments.2. We tested this hypothesis for butterflies and bumble bees in 12 independent landscapes in a region of intense agriculture in southern Sweden. In each landscape we surveyed abundance and species richness in one semi-natural grassland, one linear habitat (uncultivated field margin) adjacent to this (called proximate) and one similar linear habitat (called distant) situated at least 1000 m from the semi-natural grassland patch.3. Both species richness and density (individuals per unit area) of butterflies and bumble bees were significantly higher in proximate linear habitats than in distant ones. Moreover, butterfly species richness was higher for a given area in grasslands than in any of the linear habitat types. Butterfly density in grasslands did not differ from that in proximate linear habitats but was lower in distant linear habitats. The effect of isolation on density was stronger for less mobile butterfly species. For bumble bees there was no difference in species richness between grasslands and proximate linear habitats.4. For at least some of the butterfly species even these relatively small fragments of semi-natural grasslands act as population sources from which individuals disperse to the surrounding habitats and thereby contribute to higher densities and species richness in adjacent areas. For bumble bees, it is more likely that the grasslands contain a higher density of nests than the surrounding intensively cultivated landscape, and that the density of foraging bumble bees decreases with increasing distance from the nest.5. Synthesis and application. Habitat fragmentation and intensified agricultural practices are considered to be a threat against services provided by pollinators. In order to sustain the abundance and diversity of insect pollinators in intensively farmed agricultural landscapes, we suggest that preservation of the remaining semi-natural grasslands or re-creation of flower-rich grasslands is essential.",44,1,50,59,Habitat fragmentation; Habitat; Ecology; Grassland; Population; Biological dispersal; Species richness; Species diversity; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01250.x/abstract https://www.jstor.org/stable/4123824 https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/dff24daf-d15c-4c76-8119-e5efe41e2b57 https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01250.x https://portal.research.lu.se/portal/en/publications/seminatural-grasslands-as-population-sources-for-pollinating-insects-in-agricultural-landscapes(dff24daf-d15c-4c76-8119-e5efe41e2b57).html https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01250.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01250.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01250.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01250.x,2129636730,,0,001-718-132-298-304; 002-196-750-704-673; 004-281-677-682-461; 005-168-109-694-810; 008-167-536-662-383; 008-225-619-668-580; 010-907-813-822-262; 011-363-201-170-412; 011-715-981-140-308; 012-267-243-122-028; 013-963-568-587-742; 014-590-282-698-428; 015-218-134-012-477; 015-782-011-641-991; 016-668-772-079-670; 017-465-919-368-503; 020-468-391-112-375; 024-940-486-253-797; 031-094-771-196-289; 031-216-949-664-784; 032-474-236-800-115; 033-146-014-362-627; 033-679-811-867-654; 034-653-724-020-632; 035-775-229-294-961; 042-511-627-752-926; 048-244-533-318-55X; 049-128-080-437-254; 050-418-767-246-092; 050-907-802-597-89X; 053-367-247-740-718; 057-720-330-037-206; 061-767-872-857-957; 068-452-604-669-157; 075-638-674-736-334; 077-648-752-937-927; 079-068-774-342-74X; 079-166-448-550-892; 079-492-501-193-26X; 083-810-224-480-214; 094-506-716-348-263; 096-920-887-442-138; 098-312-271-690-700; 108-814-507-291-345; 112-410-864-747-674; 112-917-317-852-89X; 114-480-653-531-829; 115-537-551-650-895; 117-233-951-265-769; 129-806-252-951-533; 129-943-317-995-23X; 141-005-140-982-524; 142-624-071-999-929; 144-066-499-137-261; 154-386-144-197-99X; 165-420-840-117-725; 168-312-770-361-773; 178-850-274-409-230; 185-374-982-166-638; 194-791-518-890-554; 197-230-959-170-770,351

Sparkes; K. W. Jaggard; Stephen J. Ramsden; R. K. Scott,"Summary; ; The effect of field margins on the yield of sugar beet, wheat and barley was studied on commercial farms and in a series of field experiments from 1992–1997. There was always a trend of increasing yield from the edge of the field to the centre, with a marked reduction around the ‘tramlines’ and the area where machinery turns. In the studies on commercial farms, headland yield loss varied widely. In sugar beet the headlands yielded 19–41% less than the centre, with a mean reduction of 26%. In cereals the range was 3–19%, with a mean loss of 7%. Headland yield reductions were generally smaller in the field experiments than those found on commercial farms. These headland effects did not move towards the centre of the field when grass margins were planted at the edge of the field; there was no significant effect on the yield of the adjacent crop. The presence of boundary trees had the greatest effect on yield: in the outer 9 m of the field, the area shaded by trees produced 4.4 t ha-1 of wheat, and the area that was not shaded 8.1 t ha-1. Turning of machinery also significantly reduced yield, while grazing by rabbits and hares surprisingly had no effect.; ; ; ; Following the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in 1992, the main effect of which was to change from a price support policy to direct payments to producers, farmers in the European Union who produce more than a specified tonnage of ‘eligible crops’ per year, are required to fallow a given percentage of their land (currently 5%), to qualify for Arable Area Payments. Growers can elect to fallow fields on a rotational basis, or permanently. Headland set-aside is a term used to describe strips of set-aside, a minimum of 20 m wide around the edges of fields. In these experiments, the headland effect did not extend beyond 20 m from the field edge. Therefore, particularly in fields with boundary hedges or trees, headland set-aside could effectively remove the poor-yielding area at the field margin.",132,1,129,142,Crop; Headland; Common Agricultural Policy; Sugar beet; Grazing; European union; Yield (finance); Agronomy; Arable land; Biology,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1744-7348.1998.tb05190.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-7348.1998.tb05190.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7348.1998.tb05190.x,,10.1111/j.1744-7348.1998.tb05190.x,2018022032,,0,002-092-515-252-252; 007-004-204-791-127; 027-818-987-445-682; 030-191-735-591-52X; 087-625-788-327-953; 090-087-544-925-191; 091-165-444-995-827; 100-538-270-680-860,49

Grass buffer strips on cereal field edges, to reduce erosion and agro-chemical runoff into surface water, could be useful to mitigate this diversity loss as they are often assumed to provide refuge and food for invertebrates, small mammals and birds. Evidence for this idea is, however, scarce and it remains unclear whether densely vegetated buffer strips benefit biodiversity in structurally complex landscapes of Northern Europe. Here, we examined whether buffer strips affected breeding skylark Alauda avensis numbers and its main food supply (i.e. beetles Coleoptera and spiders Arachnida) on cereal fields in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape of south-central Sweden. We also examined whether buffer strip effects on skylark density depended on seasonal sward height differences between sowing regimes (spring- vs. autumn-sown) as they presumably influence seasonal invertebrate accessibility. Fields with buffer strips supported on average 0.51 ± 0.26 more skylark territories per hectare up to 100 m into the field and boosted invertebrate activity densities compared to fields without buffer strips. These effects were most apparent early in spring, but persisted throughout the sampling period, and were similar among spring and autumn sown fields. Thus, our results provide evidence to suggest that buffer strips target multiple environmental objectives on cereal fields in heterogeneous farmland. Future research should work to identify buffer strip management practices that further increase their value to biodiversity at the local scale, and investigate how they affect farmland biodiversity in different landscape types at larger spatial scales for more efficient implementation across Europe.",181,,101,107,Agriculture; Biodiversity; Invertebrate; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Alauda; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Arable land,,,,,https://gylle.dk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AGEE4478.pdf http://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND500712028 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880913003277,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.09.018,,10.1016/j.agee.2013.09.018,2155364252,,0,000-885-126-513-33X; 001-245-154-727-571; 007-416-181-403-689; 009-186-315-950-664; 011-508-246-956-659; 014-373-326-060-805; 018-827-096-171-575; 019-895-404-309-400; 022-647-096-479-517; 024-541-655-270-945; 026-766-790-225-506; 028-571-906-311-784; 030-761-865-260-149; 031-206-874-111-261; 031-592-787-048-258; 032-293-004-868-425; 032-390-963-080-355; 033-653-560-827-440; 035-947-335-206-732; 039-713-843-119-305; 043-009-269-441-396; 046-513-869-126-279; 049-557-478-030-177; 051-824-580-453-278; 052-363-993-930-092; 054-585-052-877-054; 054-715-078-148-813; 056-789-845-462-569; 062-958-100-407-68X; 064-297-474-959-451; 064-454-510-982-621; 067-095-582-035-356; 068-123-496-822-558; 068-452-604-669-157; 069-374-450-187-256; 076-863-055-982-955; 080-139-567-968-521; 086-560-114-271-630; 088-581-927-426-949; 095-869-161-076-004; 099-707-266-271-651; 104-230-077-662-702; 110-673-327-117-273; 115-123-313-615-824; 117-345-687-903-78X; 119-352-383-206-342; 120-487-356-582-40X; 120-514-812-606-235; 124-079-930-184-362; 125-357-678-676-499; 127-029-369-930-692; 131-232-875-121-714; 133-858-248-195-498; 141-000-789-286-280; 143-273-453-722-006; 145-728-200-767-581; 147-069-899-966-299; 149-200-651-727-319; 150-325-162-873-23X; 155-691-175-864-748; 158-040-572-868-750; 160-615-618-554-973; 168-507-357-881-230; 170-044-763-432-805; 172-225-641-596-161; 173-475-760-804-769; 173-731-784-504-55X; 179-048-991-295-983; 188-485-343-828-456; 195-618-519-387-640,22

McKergow; Ian P. Prosser; David M. Weaver; Rodger B. Grayson; Adrian Reed,"Rainfall takes many flowpaths to reach a stream, and the success of riparian buffers in water quality management is significantly influenced by riparian hydrology. This paper presents results from hydrometric monitoring of riparian buffer hydrology in a pasture catchment. Runoff processes and riparian flowpaths were investigated on two planar hillslopes with regenerating grass and E. globulus buffers. Surface runoff and subsurface flows (A- and B-horizons) were measured for 3 years using surface runoff collectors, subsurface troughs and piezometers. Water volumes moving through the riparian buffers via the measured flowpaths were ranked B-horizon ≫ surface runoff ≈ A-horizon. Runoff volumes through the B-horizon troughs were an order of magnitude greater than those recorded for the most productive surface runoff plots or the A-horizon troughs. Subsurface runoff and saturation-excess overland flow (SOF) were limited to the winter months, whereas infiltration-excess overland flow (IEOF) can occur all year round during intense storms. Surface runoff was recorded on 33 occasions, mostly during winter (late May–early October), and total annual surface runoff volumes collected by the 20 unconfined (2 m wide) runoff plots varied between > 80 and < 20 m3. Subsurface flow only occurred in winter, and the 6 m wide B-horizon subsurface troughs flowed above 1 l s−1 continuously, whereas the A-horizon troughs flowed infrequently (<6 days per year). In summer, surface runoff occurred as IEOF during intense storms in the E. globulus buffer, but not in the grass buffer. Observations suggest that surface crusting reduced the soil's infiltration capacity in the E. globulus buffer. During winter, SOF and seepage were observed in both buffers, but subsurface flow through the B-horizon was the dominant flowpath. Key hydrologic differences between the grass and tree buffers are the generation of IEOF in the E. globulus buffer during intense summer storms, and the smaller subsurface runoff volumes and fewer flow days in the E. globulus buffer. Low surface runoff volumes are likely to limit the potential of these buffers to filter pollutants from surface runoff. High subsurface flow volumes and saturated conductivities are also likely to limit the residence time of water in the subsurface domain. Based on their hydrologic performance, the key roles of riparian buffers in this landscape are likely to be displacing sediment and nutrient-generating activities away from streams and stabilizing channel morphology.

Feber; Michael D. Morecroft; M. Taylor; David W. Macdonald,"Field margins have been widely advocated as a means of integrating agronomic and biodiversity objectives and are included in agri-environment schemes across Europe. However, information on the long-term development of field margin plant communities remains limited. We describe a long-term experiment on the effects of field margin management on biodiversity and weed species. Swards were established by natural regeneration or sowing a grass and wildflower seed mixture, and treatments manipulated the frequency and timing of mowing, application of herbicide and leaving of hay. Vegetation was monitored to evaluate the extent to which early conclusions remained valid after 13 years. Although early successional trends suggested that naturally regenerated swards would rapidly become dominated by pernicious perennial weeds, and that sown swards would exclude such species, neither was true in the longer term. Sown swards were eventually invaded by unsown perennials, but they remained distinct from naturally regenerated swards. Plant species richness declined throughout the experiment. Annuals were lost most rapidly from sown swards but, under natural regeneration, loss could be modified by mowing. Perennial species initially increased during natural regeneration before stabilising. In sown swards they declined under all treatments. Species richness in naturally regenerating swards was promoted initially by mowing twice annually. After 13 years, timing and frequency of mowing had no significant effect on species richness although it still influenced sward composition. Leaving cut hay lying produced species-poor swards. We conclude that the choice of establishment and management methods for arable field margins significantly affects the long-term conservation value of the swards.",143,3,813,822,Biodiversity; Weed control; Vegetation; Ecology; Perennial plant; Weed; Wildflower; Plant community; Species richness; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/96890419 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103209559.html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320709005333 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103209559 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320709005333 https://core.ac.uk/download/59003.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2009.12.025,,10.1016/j.biocon.2009.12.025,2170706889,,0,003-460-280-575-85X; 003-461-880-854-275; 005-937-930-073-754; 007-416-181-403-689; 007-991-211-083-083; 012-926-285-189-171; 014-204-563-886-62X; 014-229-118-471-777; 015-072-120-385-142; 017-513-961-977-058; 018-159-689-517-278; 020-713-758-200-58X; 021-983-497-361-25X; 025-983-895-963-761; 030-453-266-652-445; 030-751-970-028-908; 031-862-039-493-29X; 035-514-795-922-621; 035-775-229-294-961; 036-882-579-432-228; 040-449-873-182-757; 044-616-246-113-964; 047-946-954-821-823; 052-025-744-277-895; 053-524-382-144-595; 054-715-078-148-813; 056-391-120-745-502; 056-585-869-238-25X; 056-789-845-462-569; 061-255-779-212-020; 061-578-102-166-612; 065-524-766-334-22X; 067-912-727-549-225; 070-239-213-610-528; 071-192-821-815-608; 071-543-579-732-418; 073-021-383-708-605; 073-359-404-037-66X; 073-537-957-075-948; 074-225-773-604-407; 076-189-574-157-146; 076-278-055-254-459; 078-875-359-328-371; 087-779-919-702-867; 096-113-030-981-318; 097-691-909-747-128; 111-564-806-763-612; 113-225-847-396-026; 114-480-653-531-829; 117-345-687-903-78X; 125-995-631-935-63X; 128-760-888-268-265; 129-154-893-686-206; 135-233-059-071-616; 138-139-474-735-49X; 144-915-982-059-308; 149-751-397-612-305; 152-856-891-760-185; 155-691-175-864-748; 161-300-804-429-199; 165-804-108-473-473; 167-175-414-731-307; 171-723-833-352-554; 178-262-983-300-325; 187-603-367-498-373; 188-597-703-306-560; 195-946-396-937-114; 197-798-610-196-806; 198-957-725-768-060,18

Woodcock; Simon G. Potts; Thomas Tscheulin; E. S. Pilgrim; Alex J. Ramsey; Jennifer Harrison-Cripps; Valerie K. Brown; Jerry R. Tallowin,"Summary; 1. Management of lowland mesotrophic grasslands in north-west Europe often makes use of inorganic fertilizers, high stocking densities and silage-based forage systems to maximize productivity. The impact of these practices has resulted in a simplification of the plant community combined with wide-scale declines in the species richness of grassland invertebrates. We aim to identify how field margin management can be used to promote invertebrate diversity across a suite of functionally diverse taxa (beetles, planthoppers, true bugs, butterflies, bumblebees and spiders).; ; 2. Using an information theoretic approach we identify the impacts of management (cattle grazing, cutting and inorganic fertilizer) and plant community composition (forb species richness, grass species richness and sward architecture) on invertebrate species richness and body size. As many of these management practices are common to grassland systems throughout the world, understanding invertebrate responses to them is important for the maintenance of biodiversity.; ; 3. Sward architecture was identified as the primary factor promoting increased species richness of both predatory and phytophagous trophic levels, as well as being positively correlated with mean body size. In all cases phytophagous invertebrate species richness was positively correlated with measures of plant species richness.; ; 4. The direct effects of management practices appear to be comparatively weak, suggesting that their impacts are indirect and mediated though the continuous measures of plant community structure, such as sward architecture or plant species richness.; ; 5. Synthesis and applications. By partitioning field margins from the remainder of the field, economically viable intensive grassland management can be combined with extensive management aimed at promoting native biodiversity. The absence of inorganic fertilizer, combined with a reduction in the intensity of both cutting and grazing regimes, promotes floral species richness and sward architectural complexity. By increasing sward architecture the total biomass of invertebrates also increased (by c. 60% across the range of sward architectural measures seen in this study), increasing food available for higher trophic levels, such as birds and mammals.",46,4,920,929,Biomass (ecology); Biodiversity; Forb; Ecology; Plant community; Species richness; Guild; Species diversity; Trophic level; Biology,,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01675.x/abstract https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas_Tscheulin/publication/227509791_Responses_of_invertebrate_trophic_level_feeding_guild_and_body_size_to_the_management_of_improved_grassland_field_margins/links/09e415061db841faf1000000.pdf http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/9400/ http://core.ac.uk/display/347305 https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01675.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01675.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01675.x https://www.jstor.org/stable/info/27696030 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093213235?q=(au%3a%22Brown%2c+V.+K.%22),http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01675.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01675.x,2067256400,,0,001-219-036-783-602; 003-251-732-418-644; 006-255-253-311-118; 011-683-163-290-01X; 012-989-674-198-846; 017-786-901-727-296; 018-426-147-707-10X; 020-024-935-817-641; 020-550-742-896-582; 023-441-454-753-268; 025-327-461-520-458; 028-196-429-731-599; 039-112-596-230-618; 039-885-186-600-094; 042-026-537-100-482; 042-589-725-170-794; 043-416-112-471-202; 056-789-845-462-569; 060-303-879-790-212; 060-405-685-824-995; 064-406-747-850-970; 065-565-421-487-993; 071-363-274-178-219; 072-985-277-248-326; 079-068-774-342-74X; 080-556-913-922-997; 092-636-423-048-294; 095-333-481-557-389; 097-940-408-467-683; 098-225-830-020-776; 098-939-648-476-800; 104-461-793-224-947; 117-345-687-903-78X; 138-845-934-876-76X; 143-970-434-573-790; 150-196-682-296-140,89

Palmer; K. M. Puckett; J. R. Anderson; Peter T. Bromley,"Reduced survival of chicks may result from exposure to insecticides and may explain declines in northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) populations on agricultural landscapes. To determine the risk insecticides pose to quail, we quantified exposure rates and hazard, Exposure rate depends on quail habitat use in relation to insecticide applications, whereas hazard depends on susceptibility to a toxin and the dose an individual receives, Because providing early-successional vegetation around row-crop fields is a typical habitat management recommendation, we determined rates of exposure of quail and their broods to insecticides applied to soybean fields with and without vegetated field borders, Radiocollared quail (n = 69) used soybean fields extensively (64% of telemetry locations) at the time of year insecticides were applied. Quail used soybean fields twice as often when vegetated borders surrounded crop fields (P = 0.04). Ten of 18 broods monitored by telemetry were located in soybean fields 88% of the time. In 1993. 4 of 6 broods 0.49). However, ChE activity was depressed (P < 0.001) and body mass was lower (P = 0.02) in chicks exposed to methyl parathion, which historically (pre-1980) received significant use in production of row crops in North Carolina.

One margin strip was supplemented by eight species of flowering plants, planted between the hedgerow and the arable crop. E. balteatus was observed foraging on all eight species at this florally rich strip. A control strip had no additional floral resources other than those naturally present. E. balteatus was significantly more abundant at the rich strip over 21 trapping days. The effectiveness of each strip to retain. E. balteatus was assessed by observing and recording the time spent by paint marked individuals within each strip. The rate of dispersal of E. balteatus from each strip was determined from the percentage of marked individuals remaining in a strip over time. Data from trapping E. balteatus, and from determining their dispersal rates from the strips were used in a simple mathematical expression to show that E. balteatus were attracted into the rich strip more than the control strip on nine study days during the first half of the investigation. E. balteatus dispersed significantly more slowly from the rich strip on nine study days during the second half of the study.

It is unknown how such a GWW affects the loading of surface runoff with dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP). The effect on DRP was tested in a landscape-scale study where DRP concentrations and loads in surface runoff were measured in two watersheds in which GWWs were newly installed and increased in effectiveness over time. Both watersheds were compared with paired watersheds without GWW installation; all watersheds were continuously monitored over 5 yr (1993-1997). Additionally, DRP concentrations were measured in open field and throughfall precipitation under growing grass and crops in field experiments, and DRP concentrations in surface runoff from straw covered surfaces were determined with laboratory rainfall simulation experiments. Dissolved reactive P in throughfall for the different cover types was highly variable, and the highest concentrations (up to 2.8 mg L(-1)) occurred especially during flowering of the respective crop and after frost events. Dissolved reactive P concentrations in runoff from straw-covered surfaces were slightly higher compared with those from bare soil. On average, there was a small difference in DRP concentrations between throughfall under growing crops and grass and in runoff from bare or straw covered soil surfaces. Hence, the introduction of a relatively small grassed area has little effect on the DRP concentration in surface runoff from the total watershed. This finding was supported by the watershed data, where watersheds with and without GWW showed similar DRP concentrations. No change in DRP concentrations occurred over the 5-yr period. Such GWWs will thus reduce the DRP load analogously to the reduction in total surface runoff.",38,2,548,559,Throughfall; Grassed waterway; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Soil test; Phosphorus; Hydrology (agriculture); Water pollution,,"Agriculture; Fresh Water/analysis; Phosphorus/analysis; Poaceae; Rain; Soil/analysis; Time Factors; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis; Water Pollution, Chemical/prevention & control","Soil; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Phosphorus","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Bavarian State Ministry for Science, Research and Arts",https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/38/2/548 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2007.0525 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19202025 https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/683833 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/1456483 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093127481 https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/en/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=200902217211999790 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19202025/,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2007.0525,19202025,10.2134/jeq2007.0525,2051972525,,0,003-720-478-631-608; 007-213-949-920-174; 008-380-052-396-94X; 008-968-627-825-555; 009-169-915-488-894; 011-288-274-938-632; 014-082-686-261-694; 015-380-809-774-96X; 017-348-037-536-365; 017-420-773-610-643; 018-668-638-487-019; 019-202-060-856-384; 022-567-727-205-476; 025-328-478-167-931; 026-992-482-224-099; 028-829-445-521-695; 031-240-545-991-607; 034-334-168-340-855; 035-246-483-251-437; 036-113-962-479-612; 044-327-313-877-518; 046-747-744-517-198; 050-198-618-361-634; 055-780-583-733-471; 060-783-323-084-203; 065-672-467-427-885; 066-008-497-105-394; 069-886-182-022-795; 071-462-069-230-683; 075-667-485-324-237; 076-826-572-086-275; 077-781-210-698-143; 083-431-696-176-966; 083-600-173-903-321; 087-680-309-241-290; 088-236-621-248-724; 090-804-589-550-521; 093-618-789-768-162; 096-145-122-087-467; 097-460-493-803-721; 105-045-620-033-468; 106-284-569-265-355; 111-288-588-656-115; 111-652-243-743-385; 117-342-446-985-725; 117-346-312-542-660; 117-655-909-979-696; 119-211-912-940-114; 129-312-799-919-14X; 129-796-363-882-204; 131-813-452-905-563; 138-643-821-809-522; 146-403-246-969-235; 146-606-352-041-123; 147-212-481-476-232; 160-087-225-408-274; 170-591-128-283-41X; 186-047-051-900-345,14

Kiss; K. Penksza; F. Toth; Ferenc Kádár,"Abstract Biotic diversity in rural areas is one of the key points of sustainable agriculture and rural development. Biotic diversity and species restoration are closely connected with habitats and thus plant cover diversity. Hungarian agriculture is in a state of transition towards market oriented production and development. Changes in property rights, farm size, land use and the greater importance of environmental issues demand new approaches for plant protection and habitat evaluation. In our study some examples will be given showing the importance both of fields and field margins and about their contribution to plant protection and nature production. Plant species and predators (carabids, spiders) were studied in winter wheat fields and in the field margins. Evidence was found of the importance of the field margin for the number and composition of plant species. Parallel to this, carabids and spiders (as significant predators) were studied. For both carabids and spiders, species number and diversity were significantly higher in field margins compared with fields. The species distribution of carabids among these two different habitats, however, indicates that some species are typical ‘field species’. Thus, proper management of both habitats is necessary so that they may contribute to biotic diversity. A possible evaluation of the contribution of habitats to native flora and fauna is discussed.",63,2-3,227,232,Agriculture; Fauna; Species distribution; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Plant cover; Geography; Land use; Sustainable agriculture,,,,,http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=NL1998004683 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167880997000182,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-8809(97)00018-2,,10.1016/s0167-8809(97)00018-2,1970881752,,0,006-724-155-122-267; 032-673-637-913-382; 055-083-398-263-398; 082-897-735-170-937; 091-263-380-287-213; 120-289-218-887-128; 174-075-225-091-588,36

Management, crop and boundary structure influences on invertebrate activity were assessed, as was the relationship between crop and boundary type. Classification of crop and boundary assemblages produced three and two groups, respectively, in both years. Organic arable crops had well-defined assemblages in both years; and, while grass and grass/clover fields were separated from conventional arable fields in 2005, there was mixing in 2006. One boundary group, in both years, was dominated by conventional arable fields with tall herbaceous boundary vegetation. The other group had more organic arable and grassy fields with shorter boundary vegetation. Redundancy analyses showed that a number of groups (Cantharidae, Coccinellidae, Syrphidae, Ichneumonidae, Braconidae, Proctotrupoidea, Lycosidae) were more active in organic arable fields with more Staphylinidae in conventional arable crops and no obvious trend with Carabidae, Hemiptera, Neuroptera and Linyphiidae. Activity of some groups, especially Coccinellidae, Syrphidae and parasitic wasps, was strongly related to weed cover. Staphylinidae were most active in tall herbaceous boundaries by conventional arable crops with more of a number of groups (Cantharidae, Coccinellidae, parasitic wasps) in short herbaceous boundaries by organic arable crops. Organic management produced most differences in aerially-dispersed invertebrates, and management had a profound effect on activity in field boundaries. Possible management prescriptions to increase invertebrate activity include changing sowing times, weed cover manipulation and field boundary and margin management.",101,2,135,144,Organic farming; Crop; Sowing; Vegetation; Ecology; Weed; Linyphiidae; Agroecosystem; Agronomy; Arable land; Biology,,Agriculture; Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources/methods; England; Insecta/physiology; Organic Agriculture; Plant Weeds; Poaceae; Spiders/physiology; Trifolium,,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bulletin-of-entomological-research/article/crop-and-field-boundary-influences-on-the-activity-of-a-wide-range-of-beneficial-invertebrate-groups-on-a-split-conventionalorganic-farm-in-northern-england/D9BF88D9BB73B70E2C4CEDFD63CA486A https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0007485310000398 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21034520,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0007485310000398,21034520,10.1017/s0007485310000398,2047297040,,0,002-669-586-055-41X; 005-206-260-974-756; 005-303-491-148-085; 007-590-189-380-964; 007-598-747-351-663; 014-229-118-471-777; 015-159-829-255-283; 017-516-181-294-137; 018-827-921-966-336; 021-727-244-747-274; 030-368-776-679-588; 035-335-736-366-844; 038-950-105-220-885; 041-768-237-199-317; 047-367-958-846-378; 047-647-835-437-685; 050-320-077-462-032; 050-985-622-056-969; 057-720-330-037-206; 057-981-598-792-734; 058-105-561-757-413; 061-017-051-481-03X; 061-825-091-176-860; 063-826-302-057-018; 064-975-099-130-640; 066-979-388-031-121; 068-730-938-041-13X; 069-405-099-165-947; 070-162-490-783-176; 072-457-703-192-072; 081-187-254-788-856; 081-346-750-789-589; 086-525-130-009-786; 092-286-036-576-532; 098-035-451-831-547; 101-679-988-502-372; 106-866-820-349-832; 115-537-551-650-895; 126-322-219-192-539; 130-190-390-087-555; 142-547-556-180-595; 150-761-385-310-830; 150-827-413-891-88X; 153-384-380-287-983; 162-510-456-164-420; 166-826-142-461-007; 191-245-265-713-754,18

Wes Burger; Samuel K. Riffell; Mark D. Smith; Daniel J. Twedt; R. Randy Wilson; Shawchyi Vorisek; Catherine Rideout; Kate Heyden,"Native herbaceous vegetation cover along row-crop field edges (i.e., field buffers) increases breeding densities of many bird species. However, the effect of field buffers on bird species during the non-breeding season is less understood. We compared density, avian richness, and avian conservation value on row-crop fields containing buffers strategically designed for wildlife versus fields without buffers in 3 southeastern U.S. states during winter 2007 and 2008. Fields with buffers were enrolled in U.S. Department of Agriculture, Conservation Reserve Program practice Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds (CP33), which targets restoration of northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and other upland bird species. Overall species richness did not differ on fields with buffers versus fields without buffers in 2007, but was 29% greater on fields with buffers in 2008. Swamp sparrows (Melospiza georgiana), song sparrows (M. melodia), field sparrows (Spizella pusilla), and red-bellied woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus) had greater densities on fields with buffers compared with fields without buffers. Increasing field-buffer width did not result in greater bird densities. Our results suggest a small change in primary land use (≈7%) produced a disproportionate population response by some grassland-dependent and woodland bird species during winter. Because field buffers provide a direct source of winter food and cover resources, they may be a pragmatic means to provide critical non-breeding habitat with little alteration of existing agricultural systems. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.",38,2,257,264,Conservation Reserve Program; Habitat; Ecology; Woodland; Geography; Spizella; Melospiza; Wildlife; Species richness; Swamp,,,,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; U.S. Department of Agriculture,http://www.gri.msstate.edu/publications/docs/2014/02/12439wsb_405_Rev_EV.pdf https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70047553 https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wsb.405 https://www.gri.msstate.edu/publications/docs/2014/02/12439wsb_405_Rev_EV.pdf http://www.hpc.msstate.edu/publications/docs/2014/02/12439wsb_405_Rev_EV.pdf http://www.erc.msstate.edu/publications/docs/2014/02/12439wsb_405_Rev_EV.pdf http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wsb.405/abstract https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wsb.405 https://www.hpc.msstate.edu/publications/docs/2014/02/12439wsb_405_Rev_EV.pdf https://www.cavs.msstate.edu/publications/docs/2014/02/12439wsb_405_Rev_EV.pdf http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wsb.405/full,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wsb.405,,10.1002/wsb.405,1950482343,,0,000-281-554-875-962; 002-179-772-236-941; 004-871-735-458-549; 006-866-792-170-310; 007-194-033-627-161; 007-345-255-242-473; 008-157-210-875-523; 012-737-200-927-794; 017-298-227-855-778; 020-167-621-399-502; 027-356-962-068-696; 031-810-874-084-460; 031-938-563-126-363; 034-456-136-124-424; 035-607-041-295-847; 040-618-665-169-421; 040-889-337-784-868; 041-439-521-217-570; 042-082-544-198-293; 044-307-871-990-779; 050-261-844-716-21X; 050-605-450-949-818; 051-865-427-302-095; 059-472-939-527-494; 059-693-318-258-980; 060-114-103-966-089; 061-472-431-665-855; 064-643-064-473-458; 065-890-360-780-473; 068-452-604-669-157; 068-470-946-304-261; 068-567-084-277-634; 070-807-130-928-517; 075-491-486-540-39X; 076-663-121-778-500; 086-141-645-879-155; 088-738-766-925-204; 089-432-459-576-010; 093-007-840-214-489; 095-455-937-190-024; 096-646-959-288-282; 103-964-543-837-837; 113-020-887-836-867; 115-123-313-615-824; 115-611-647-492-038; 119-334-550-015-609; 128-130-250-855-94X; 131-566-895-865-825; 133-199-519-838-349; 133-946-407-274-426; 150-162-603-118-587; 162-932-673-062-383; 169-671-957-670-649; 176-218-987-199-331; 191-508-311-193-465,4

Carmona; Douglas A. Landis,"Carabid beetles are important predators of arthropods and weed seeds in annual crops but may be limited in impact by the frequent and intense disturbances imposed on these systems. Pitfall trap sampling conducted in 1996 and 1997 examined the effect of refuge strips and cover crops on enhancing the seasonal activity-density of carabid beetles. The study site followed a soybean, Glycine max L. Merr, oats, Avena sativa L., and corn, Zea mays L., rotation. Refuges consisted of a central strip of 3 perennial flowering plants, Agastache foeniculun (Pursh) O. Kuntze, Origanum vulgare L., and Scropularia nodosa L, with orchard grass, Dactylis glomerata L., white clover, Trifolium repens L., and sweet clover, Melilotus officinalis L., seeded on each side. A cover crop was present only in 1996 and consisted of frost seeded red clover, Trifolium pratense L. A total of 5,117 and 2,316 carabid beetles was captured in pitfall traps comprising 14 species in 1996 and 20 species in 1997. Carabid beetle seasonal activity-density was greater (1996) or equal (1997) in refuge strips than in control areas without refuge strips; however, the presence of a refuge strip did not alter carabid populations in the surrounding subplots in either year. In 1996, subplots containing a cover crop had significantly higher carabid beetle activity-density than subplots without a cover crop. There was no carryover effect of cover crop on beetle activity-density in 1997. Among the most abundant species, a greater proportion of captures of the fall breeding species Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger), Pterostichus permundus (Say), and the spring breeding species Poecilus lucublandus (Say) occurred in the refuge strips. The spring breeders Poecilus chalcites (Say), Harpalus herbivagus Say, and Agonum cupripenne (Say), and the phytophagous fall breeder Harpalus pensylvanicus (De Geer) occurred in greater proportions in the crop areas.

Holland; H. Oaten; S.

The relative abundance of different natural enemy guilds were manipulated to investigate their impact on grain aphids (Sitobion avenae) and whether the establishment of wider field margins increased levels of control. The impact of epigeal and flying aphid predators, in isolation and together, on cereal aphids was tested in five fields with standard field margins (ca. 2 m wide) and in five fields with wide margins (ca. 6 m wide). Flying predators alone were as effective as all predators in controlling the grain aphid and reduced aphids by 90% and 93%, whereas epigeal predators alone achieved a reduction of only 40% and 18% in fields with standard and wide margins respectively. Levels of parasitism measured by counts of aphid mummies were relatively low (⩽12%) on all sampling occasions. There was no evidence that the wide field margins increased natural enemies within the adjacent field as measured using pitfall traps, suction sampling and sticky traps. The wide field margins were considered to have no benefit for biocontrol because flying predators capable of moving between fields were primarily responsible or the amount of uncropped land suitable for natural enemies was not a limiting factor in the landscape.",47,1,71,76,Epigeal; Biological pest control; Agroecology; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Aphid; Parasitism; Sitobion avenae; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049964408001667 https://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND44106039,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2008.06.010,,10.1016/j.biocontrol.2008.06.010,2051087037,,0,000-263-405-556-010; 002-481-580-200-407; 003-815-496-301-575; 005-744-519-834-866; 006-906-088-402-716; 008-749-571-472-067; 014-475-770-713-515; 016-052-929-723-298; 016-823-705-101-257; 021-456-573-673-200; 022-070-333-305-083; 023-888-062-670-958; 028-106-119-563-735; 034-739-142-297-866; 035-291-489-710-924; 040-917-737-394-389; 051-728-484-218-665; 054-226-689-654-507; 056-101-024-270-22X; 056-892-630-404-500; 057-612-922-967-628; 060-278-479-578-886; 062-036-445-726-722; 063-289-521-238-627; 063-670-046-308-472; 069-379-822-515-162; 076-540-943-950-859; 078-422-899-116-204; 080-139-567-968-521; 080-556-913-922-997; 086-402-015-642-906; 087-186-786-234-321; 091-310-351-165-89X; 103-547-760-004-228; 104-699-012-665-29X; 109-691-661-850-685; 111-528-391-156-029; 111-818-874-417-479; 114-646-769-502-277; 117-361-487-287-804; 125-522-712-729-010; 127-608-631-834-505; 170-847-181-817-093; 172-979-929-750-368,43

B. Daniels; J. W. Gilliam,"Vegetated filter strips help reduce non-point source pollution from agricultural areas. Even though they are an accepted and highly promoted practice, little quantitative data exist on their effectiveness under field conditions. The objective of this research was to determine the amount of nutrients and sediment removed by natural and planted filters. This was achieved by collecting and analyzing runoff at field edges and at various locations in vegetated buffers. Total weight of sediment and nutrients in runoff from North Carolina agricultural fields showed that the grass and riparian filter strips studied reduced runoff load by 50 to 80%. Total sediment decrease through the filters was about 80% for both grass and riparian vegetation. The reduction in the chemical load depended on the nutrient and its form. Filters reduced total P load by 50%, but 80% of the soluble PO 4 -P arriving at the field edge frequently passed through the filters. The filters retained 20 to 50% of the NH 4 and approximately 50% of the total Kjeldahl N and NO 3 . High-volume flows commonly overwhelmed both grass and riparian filters next to cultivated fields. Forested ephemeral channels had little vegetation and were effective sediment sinks during the dry season but were ineffective during large storm events because there was little resistance to flow. When possible, drainageways should be designed to hold sediment and to disperse the discharge into a riparian area.",60,1,246,251,Riparian zone; Nutrient; Soil water; Vegetation; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Pollution; Field experiment,,,,"Water Resources Research Institute, North Carolina State University",https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/sssaj/abstracts/60/1/SS0600010246 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1996.03615995006000010037x http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996SSASJ..60..246D/abstract https://www.soils.org/publications/sssaj/abstracts/60/1/SS0600010246,http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1996.03615995006000010037x,,10.2136/sssaj1996.03615995006000010037x,2060038127,,0,,377

Bianchi; Felix L. Wäckers,"Flowering plants have been shown to differ with regard to their attractiveness to parasitoids and nectar accessibility. These floral traits are likely to affect the foraging performance of parasitoids in agricultural landscapes. Using a spatially explicit simulation model we explore how the attractiveness and nectar availability of flowering field margins affects their impact on parasitoids and ultimately on pest populations in crops. The model simulates the movement, nectar feeding and parasitism of parasitoids in an agroecosystem composed of a crop and adjacent flower margin. The perception of olfactory cues emitted by flowers and host-infested plants drives the movement of the parasitoid. Its preference for floral nectar or hosts is described as a function of its internal energy status. Model validation reveals that simulations and measurements of the spatial distribution and energy status of parasitoids are generally in good agreement. Model simulations suggest that aggregation of parasitoids at flower strips are caused by a prolonged longevity of parasitoids feeding on floral nectar as well as by attraction of parasitoids from the surrounding area. We found no indication for depletion of parasitoids in the field interior as a result of migration towards flower strips. Simulations further suggest that the attractiveness of flowers is an important characteristic that should be taken into account for the selection of flowering plants. This study implies that tailoring nectar supply to the requirements of parasitoids holds potential to increase their effectiveness as biological control agents.",46,3,400,408,Biological pest control; Nectar; Foraging; Ecology; PEST analysis; Parasitoid; Attraction; Hymenoptera; Attractiveness; Biology,,,,,https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/28210/ https://core.ac.uk/display/29255551 http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/385489 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049964408001023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2008.04.010,,10.1016/j.biocontrol.2008.04.010,2109044857,,0,000-999-762-967-231; 006-791-075-513-444; 009-422-695-763-933; 012-466-311-051-172; 017-395-818-392-992; 017-809-630-927-614; 021-595-332-317-205; 022-447-131-806-282; 023-269-484-535-446; 024-165-324-486-921; 033-750-034-115-624; 039-852-919-577-151; 040-182-369-950-331; 042-195-189-711-603; 046-892-381-636-235; 047-647-835-437-685; 054-648-441-787-584; 056-892-630-404-500; 064-016-669-060-442; 065-717-158-017-31X; 071-649-833-498-248; 076-310-935-751-741; 076-349-963-255-639; 079-263-567-226-387; 081-110-180-250-619; 082-749-794-113-073; 089-884-663-621-63X; 095-026-354-929-83X; 095-787-505-942-81X; 095-982-283-440-77X; 096-139-400-901-30X; 101-679-988-502-372; 126-567-876-134-094; 134-177-399-012-284; 138-410-158-813-551; 167-155-411-072-782; 194-595-863-937-394,115

J. P. Marshall,"Summary; ; A paired-field study was made in southern England in arable fields, each with or without sown 6-m wide grass margin strips. Seven field pairs were located in each of small, intermediate and open landscapes, which were based on mean field size. Ground cover, plant species diversity and assemblages were assessed in crop centres, crop edges and non-crop field boundaries. The data were used to test for effects of sown grass margins, differences in field location, impacts on rare weed species and for landscape effects on weed assemblages. Significantly higher plant species diversity was found in boundaries protected by buffer strips. Annual weeds associated with field edges, notably Anisantha sterilis, were found at lower cover where perennial grass strips were present. Sown grass strips enhanced boundary plant diversity, particularly by increasing polycarpic species. Margin strips had a small influence on the weed flora of the crop edge, possibly reducing weed cover, but had no influence on floras of field centres. Field size and landscape context did not affect weed assemblages, which show marked field-to-field variability, though crop type was an important influence. Grass margins did not enhance rare arable weed species and may be a threat to them, if margins are sited where such species are known to occur in the seedbank. With this exception, grass strips are a positive influence on boundary flora diversity and reduce margin weeds in arable landscapes.",49,1,107,115,Biodiversity; Crop; Geography; Perennial plant; Weed; Context (language use); Buffer strip; Agroforestry; Species diversity; Agronomy; Arable land,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093049145 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2008.00670.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2008.00670.x,,10.1111/j.1365-3180.2008.00670.x,2130561828,,0,005-050-770-762-472; 007-590-189-380-964; 012-335-108-074-344; 013-708-466-279-580; 016-421-756-148-512; 018-028-975-115-624; 020-713-595-267-906; 025-149-893-113-195; 036-164-148-520-238; 044-841-772-270-362; 051-142-846-902-010; 052-363-993-930-092; 054-715-078-148-813; 056-099-523-856-735; 056-789-845-462-569; 057-228-518-159-235; 063-003-550-683-547; 065-071-886-701-523; 070-239-213-610-528; 071-000-612-789-205; 071-543-579-732-418; 079-892-551-731-823; 096-364-192-925-534; 102-519-835-076-978; 114-421-043-522-327; 117-345-687-903-78X; 131-055-904-362-302; 139-704-916-484-305; 143-694-806-983-750; 146-589-148-444-417; 155-691-175-864-748,59

Long; Barb Sanipelli; J.C. Tait,"Vegetated buffer strips (VBS) are often recommended as a management practice that farmers can use to help mitigate the environmental effects of runoff from agricultural fields. Previous research has shown that VBS can be effective at trapping phosphorus (P) and other farm-sourced environmental contaminants. This project measured the effectiveness of established vegetated strips at decreasing P in runoff from agricultural fields in Manitoba. Paired samples of runoff, taken at the field edge and in the vegetated strip, indicated that in 11 of the 22 cases sampled (50%), P concentrations in the runoff decreased (on average 30%) as the flow passed through the vegetated strip. In 7 of the 22 case (32%) there was no difference; however, in four of the 22 cases (18%), runoff P concentrations increased, indicating the vegetated strip had become a source of runoff P. Soil samples from the VBS showed high available P concentrations at positions within the vegetated strip along the runoff flow path, and in 7 of 10 c...",86,5,871,884,Paired samples; Hydrology; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Soil test; Phosphorus,,,,,https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND43903935 https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.4141/S05-072,http://dx.doi.org/10.4141/s05-072,,10.4141/s05-072,2040548608,,0,002-916-363-298-786; 003-888-081-454-171; 005-046-617-641-306; 008-380-052-396-94X; 011-288-274-938-632; 020-162-059-901-178; 023-496-728-664-755; 024-120-952-575-600; 026-089-157-505-021; 028-146-838-004-688; 028-802-252-344-012; 029-227-515-568-324; 034-748-846-517-673; 055-329-231-017-432; 055-590-572-243-787; 068-997-932-046-194; 070-129-859-863-682; 072-023-336-426-165; 076-826-572-086-275; 082-797-391-654-568; 087-484-872-771-495; 095-869-161-076-004; 111-288-588-656-115; 115-642-860-718-878; 128-195-997-346-382; 142-785-205-734-481; 166-604-449-988-782; 169-607-559-923-667,41

Mengis; S. L. Schif; M. Harris; M. C. English; Ramon Aravena; Rj. Elgood; A. MacLean,"During the last 40 years, nitrate (NO3−) has become one of the most common ground water contaminants. Stream riparian zones are considered important ecological ecotones that decrease the NO3− load of ground water discharging into streams. This study uses NO3−/Cl− ratios, natural abundances of15N and18O in NO3−, and an in situ15NO3− tracer experiment to evaluate NO3− reducing processes occurring in ground water within a narrow grassed buffer strip bordering a stream in an agricultural watershed. The NO3−/Cl− ratios (1.9-0.0 [M/M]) indicate that both NO3− consuming processes and mixing of two ground water flow regimes with different NO3− loads contribute to the drop observed in ground water NO3− concentrations within the riparian zone. δ15N and δ18O of the ground water NO3− within the riparian zone (δ15N = 5.1 to 48.8 %c; δ18O = 1.1 to 17.8 %c) were enriched compared to the ground water below the adjacent cultivated field (δ15N = 3.8 to 10.1 %0; δ18O = 0.5 to 6.2 %c). A significant linear relationship (r2=0.97) between ground water δ15N and δ18O in NO3− was found, which is consistent with NO3− consumption by microbial denitrification. The estimated enrichment factors for15N are a factor of 1.5 higher than for18O. The in situ15NO3− tracer experiment conclusively confirmed that denitrification is occurring within the ground water of the riparian zone and demonstrates that denitrification rates can be directly measured in situ.",37,3,448,457,Riparian zone; Nitrate; Hydrology; Environmental science; STREAMS; Buffer strip; δ18O; Denitrification; Groundwater; Water pollution,,,,,https://eurekamag.com/research/011/024/011024462.php https://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/343572-multiple-geochemical-isotopic-approaches-assessing-ground-water-sub-sup-minus-elimination-riparian-zone https://ngwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-6584.1999.tb01124.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-6584.1999.tb01124.x/full http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-6584.1999.tb01124.x/abstract https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/1390578,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.1999.tb01124.x,,10.1111/j.1745-6584.1999.tb01124.x,2168854791,,0,002-320-578-563-973; 006-017-352-131-346; 008-504-704-938-364; 008-617-825-775-304; 009-395-399-042-006; 010-683-837-133-736; 013-930-883-934-117; 016-970-669-778-593; 017-133-673-431-320; 017-709-159-607-177; 021-227-002-702-937; 021-637-752-924-100; 022-378-828-741-187; 024-362-496-596-206; 030-587-602-032-688; 036-870-183-042-794; 050-633-878-665-03X; 061-832-013-477-33X; 070-968-294-510-827; 071-538-902-315-424; 081-146-598-099-607; 083-158-334-528-093; 083-654-364-523-106; 089-729-272-444-541; 089-892-428-700-389; 100-845-850-323-114; 105-256-122-449-743; 106-614-168-844-726; 109-296-340-148-983; 113-071-214-996-41X; 121-468-243-703-60X; 130-400-366-205-374; 137-890-167-917-845; 148-774-488-577-109; 162-337-157-677-385; 176-961-600-460-314; 199-728-278-207-401,318

R. Meek; Richard F. Pywell; Marek Nowakowski,"Abstract Agricultural intensification is likely to have been a major factor leading to serious declines in bumblebee abundance and diversity in the UK and elsewhere over recent decades. Opportunities to restore habitat for bumblebees on uncropped arable field margins are now available, although the methods by which this restoration can be achieved have not been fully investigated. We present the results of a three year study undertaken to investigate the response of foraging bumblebees to five different arable field margin treatments (sown and unsown), as part of a replicated field experiment on arable farmland in northern England (UK). Bumblebee abundance was closely linked to successional changes in availability of suitable forage plant species. Field margin treatments sown with a `grass and wildflower' mixture had the highest bumblebee abundance, and provided a consistent supply of forage species, with different components of the seed mixture flowering in each year. The unsown natural regeneration treatment attracted foraging bumblebees in only the second year due to the local abundance of thistles, so we consider this option to be both inconsistent in terms of forage provision and agronomically unacceptable. Our results are discussed in terms of developing suitable measures to achieve the restoration of habitats for bumblebees on arable farmland.",118,3,327,339,Forage (honey bee); Wildlife conservation; Foraging; Habitat; Ecology; Bumblebee; Wildflower; Agronomy; Arable land; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320703003707 https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-5e79e264-8e4e-3b45-8042-240e484aa3cd http://core.ac.uk/display/381231,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2003.09.012,,10.1016/j.biocon.2003.09.012,2083772340,,0,001-051-404-142-811; 004-468-911-725-66X; 008-821-738-651-977; 009-012-164-159-153; 010-176-196-781-330; 012-110-995-744-916; 018-442-796-237-224; 020-074-979-227-411; 039-885-186-600-094; 044-616-246-113-964; 046-004-550-166-441; 047-022-834-071-036; 048-543-721-099-075; 049-088-413-362-630; 050-418-767-246-092; 052-363-993-930-092; 052-425-505-697-799; 056-585-869-238-25X; 056-789-845-462-569; 057-951-815-743-465; 059-361-082-177-816; 060-136-069-214-154; 076-609-834-637-348; 077-623-747-437-53X; 080-139-567-968-521; 085-941-087-561-247; 092-538-659-846-218; 099-773-317-713-401; 105-466-690-006-049; 108-814-507-291-345; 114-480-653-531-829; 117-345-687-903-78X; 118-094-170-257-300; 123-437-221-069-063; 133-061-521-205-100; 154-386-144-197-99X; 170-590-252-813-233; 178-495-341-468-203; 184-061-655-286-989; 184-899-964-527-087; 185-374-982-166-638; 188-588-802-460-024,122

To determine best management practices for designing buffer strips that conserve beneficial insects, nine plant communities were evaluated. We hypothesized that the diversity and abundance of beneficial insects will be: (1) greatest in diverse plant communities with continuous availability of floral resources; (2) intermediate in plant communities with reduced plant species richness and availability of floral resources; and, (3) lowest in plant communities composed of a single species. More diverse and abundant beneficial insect communities were observed in diverse and forb-only plant communities compared to simple plant communities, especially in treatments composed of species attractive to beneficial insects compared to compositions recommended for prairie restoration. Model comparisons revealed significant positive relationships between the diversity and abundance of beneficial guilds with plant",,,,,Biodiversity; Native plant; Ecology; Geography; Beneficial insects; Prairie restoration; Plant community; Species richness; Abundance (ecology); Restoration ecology,,,,,https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/13048/ https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4055&context=etd,http://dx.doi.org/10.31274/etd-180810-3383,,10.31274/etd-180810-3383,54667884,,0,002-669-586-055-41X; 005-386-192-531-136; 009-172-624-760-904; 010-171-254-110-63X; 011-508-246-956-659; 012-267-243-122-028; 015-905-951-111-509; 020-583-055-251-812; 026-162-389-848-750; 029-606-951-915-759; 032-225-968-310-157; 034-333-107-858-752; 035-138-891-064-544; 042-901-456-467-656; 042-984-923-726-95X; 045-924-425-733-406; 049-997-909-846-645; 055-083-398-263-398; 056-892-630-404-500; 057-420-111-160-322; 057-720-330-037-206; 059-335-734-146-128; 062-036-445-726-722; 063-141-893-182-571; 063-809-373-703-852; 069-083-458-833-742; 077-532-222-012-842; 078-152-796-237-76X; 086-525-130-009-786; 089-820-647-773-411; 090-637-596-119-953; 093-737-541-507-956; 095-445-262-637-385; 098-593-067-271-297; 102-070-713-446-152; 108-360-492-320-399; 110-289-201-688-146; 110-615-645-553-85X; 121-113-313-406-625; 131-462-042-788-489; 150-275-342-089-773; 151-198-714-084-659; 158-498-105-839-226; 161-072-580-272-396,4

Lemmers; Melanie M. Davidson; Ruth C. Butler,"Some introduced passerine species can cause considerable damage to arable crops in New Zealand. These crops are usually surrounded by hedgerows and, in Canterbury, these are commonly Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) and macrocarpa (Cupressus macrocarpa). The present study aimed to determine whether bird abundance and species composition differed among field margins bordered either by hedgerows of common species (pine and macrocarpa), mixed hedgerows (a variety of native and introduced plant species) or bare fence lines (no hedgerow). The numbers and species of birds along line transects traversing field margins were recorded on three different farms during spring and summer 2012. Generally, the same 12 introduced bird species were found along the different margins. However, a greater number of chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs), European goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis), European greenfinch (Carduelis chloris) and, to a lesser extent, house sparrow (Passer domesticus) were recorded in common hedgerows than in mixe...",41,3,203,209,Ecology; Pinus radiata; Fringilla; Sparrow; Passerine; Carduelis; European greenfinch; Common species; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03014223.2014.893893?src=recsys,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03014223.2014.893893,,10.1080/03014223.2014.893893,2051685534,,0,004-529-124-842-767; 010-015-870-849-695; 015-608-316-793-909; 026-162-389-848-750; 037-142-676-950-062; 043-302-567-346-605; 044-623-321-549-254; 059-708-738-613-263; 085-074-332-589-700; 092-039-735-054-276; 098-353-753-314-047; 109-933-710-408-914; 111-085-619-662-631; 139-200-896-129-808; 183-961-119-857-896; 193-363-752-812-856,2

Fox; S. Chris Reberg-Horton; David B. Orr; Christopher E. Moorman; Steven D. Frank,"a b s t r a c t Weed seed predation was studied in nine organic crop fields (three each of maize, soybeans and hay; 2.5-4.0 ha each) surrounded by four experimental field border types (planted native grass and prairie flowers, planted prairie flowers only, fallow vegetation, or mowed vegetation) during the fall of 2009 and 2010 in eastern North Carolina. We used predator exclusion cages to determine the amount of weed seed removal caused by invertebrates and vertebrates. Three common agricultural weed species, red- root pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), broadleaf signalgrass (Urochloa platyphylla), and sicklepod (Senna obtusifolia), were adhered to individual cards and placed inside the exclosure cages once a month for two weeks. Activity-density of invertebrate weed seed predators was measured with pitfall traps. Results show that field border type had no effect on seed removal rates, but that crop type heavily influenced both weed seed predation and invertebrate seed predator activity-density. Weed seed predation was highest in the dense, perennial hay fields and lowest in the more open harvested maize fields. Activity- densities for field crickets (Gryllus sp.) and the ground beetle Harpalus pennsylvanicus were also high in the hay fields and low in the maize fields, while the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) seemed to prefer the open maize fields. These results show that increasing vegetative diversity in field borders is not always an effective method for conserving weed seed predators, but that higher quality habitat inside the crop field can be achieved by increasing ground cover. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.",177,,58,62,Crop; Vegetation; Predation; Weed; Seed predation; Exclosure; Senna obtusifolia; Harpalus pennsylvanicus; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016788091300203X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.06.006,,10.1016/j.agee.2013.06.006,2152155369,,0,006-384-590-654-358; 009-065-626-813-973; 015-415-550-597-198; 021-026-931-239-376; 022-070-333-305-083; 031-114-644-626-51X; 034-210-790-826-930; 038-663-860-675-689; 041-747-216-894-684; 045-482-618-731-129; 047-588-514-493-494; 057-720-330-037-206; 057-898-374-057-282; 059-804-606-271-839; 067-445-194-832-019; 071-511-859-224-147; 074-504-972-959-800; 077-758-127-449-992; 081-708-465-596-353; 083-625-672-314-565; 087-186-786-234-321; 091-265-753-392-171; 095-536-501-019-116; 096-113-874-823-168; 100-986-860-964-168; 110-617-178-603-57X; 117-466-478-305-186; 140-355-039-582-52X; 183-925-859-507-535,19

Fargue-Lelièvre; D. Le Cœur; Jacques Baudry,"Abstract Several studies have proven the importance of field margins in sustaining biodiversity and other work has been done on the effect of field management on field margin flora. However few models have been built to predict the effects of field management on the flora. Our project addresses this need for a model capable of predicting the effect of cropping techniques and their timing on the flora of field margins. Primula vulgaris is a biodiversity indicator, characteristic of undisturbed flora and found in field margins and woodlands: its population has been declining for several years. We created a temporal matrix model of P. vulgaris populations on field margins, taking into account the effects of field, field margin and roadside management based on literature and expert knowledge. We then analysed its sensitivity to demographic parameters by comparing lambda (growth rate) sensitivity and elasticity. We compared the management parameter effect using the relative growth rate of the population after 6 years of simulation. Sensitivity analysis to biological parameters showed the importance of adult survival and seed production and germination. Results show that P. vulgaris is particularly sensitive to broad-spectrum herbicides and that other management techniques like early mowing, scything and scrub-killer (diluted broad-spectrum herbicide or specific herbicide) are less aggressive. Our simulations show that management of cash crops in Brittany is too aggressive for P. vulgaris populations and that 4–5 years of grassland in the adjacent field are necessary to maintain populations.",222,4,1002,1015,Agriculture; Biodiversity; Cropping; Flora; Ecology; Woodland; Grassland; Primula vulgaris; Population; Biology,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecomod/v222y2011i4p1002-1015.html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380010006344 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01000167,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2010.11.025,,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2010.11.025,2018077030,,0,000-669-594-539-024; 007-243-303-723-240; 007-290-713-862-982; 009-344-777-389-833; 012-140-397-274-261; 014-193-777-320-583; 016-441-096-350-667; 016-530-076-334-39X; 018-069-577-454-103; 020-024-935-817-641; 020-713-595-267-906; 022-918-260-400-877; 024-571-906-248-900; 025-452-740-077-869; 025-983-895-963-761; 028-917-029-117-685; 031-862-039-493-29X; 032-092-568-630-622; 037-619-770-840-99X; 038-466-514-865-559; 039-453-492-999-196; 041-636-767-976-553; 042-168-379-149-822; 042-598-458-284-192; 046-767-300-153-803; 048-248-613-910-99X; 056-789-845-462-569; 060-212-024-680-436; 064-939-210-354-936; 065-571-211-857-221; 068-143-605-669-192; 069-606-851-845-280; 070-314-903-562-073; 072-381-259-408-94X; 073-723-668-372-363; 078-989-590-205-118; 083-296-610-777-228; 091-449-320-063-352; 099-519-954-014-909; 100-229-431-513-918; 103-822-141-108-70X; 108-184-303-981-308; 109-834-836-962-968; 111-133-295-313-438; 117-345-687-903-78X; 123-653-571-393-994; 130-341-110-693-83X; 130-698-554-759-854; 131-718-614-593-596; 133-744-688-564-298; 139-881-434-195-84X; 143-507-381-014-244; 150-312-221-768-673; 172-358-826-429-297; 174-286-544-519-158; 176-506-367-701-104; 178-411-469-458-660; 186-739-979-596-835; 188-468-956-254-948,0

The destruction of traditionally managed orchards, an important breeding habitat in Central Europe, is a relevant cause. An additional factor for the decline of this species could be the intensified management of the ground vegetation in orchards through reducing food availability and lowering prey detectability and accessibility. In this study we examined the importance of surfaces with sparse vegetation for the location of redstart territories and for foraging. To validate the results of these field studies we made habitat-choice experiments in aviaries with captive birds. Territories occupied by redstarts in orchards of northwestern Switzerland contained a significantly higher proportion of surfaces with sparse vegetation than unoccupied control sites. Redstarts made almost five times more hunting flights into experimentally established ruderal vegetation strips than into adjacent unmown meadows. No difference was observed when the meadow was freshly mown. Vegetation height and the proportion of open ground surface correctly predicted the vegetation type for hunting in 77% of the cases. Experiments in aviaries offering two types of sparse vegetation and a dense meadow supported the results of the field experiments. Even a four-fold increase of the food abundance in the meadow did not lead to a noticeable change in preference for the sparse vegetation types. For the conservation of the common redstart, not only traditionally managed orchards with tall trees with cavities should be preserved but also areas with sparse vegetation should be favored.",151,2,297,307,Foraging; Ruderal species; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Vegetation (pathology); Redstart; Vegetation type; Orchard; Phoenicurus phoenicurus,,,,,https://orgprints.org/id/eprint/16970/ https://doi.org/10.1007/s10336-009-0455-6 https://edoc.unibas.ch/20723/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10336-009-0455-6 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10336-009-0455-6/fulltext.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-009-0455-6,,10.1007/s10336-009-0455-6,1986897907,,0,002-900-720-944-007; 003-251-732-418-644; 006-845-725-778-120; 007-991-211-083-083; 012-891-865-787-699; 014-694-787-738-700; 016-421-756-148-512; 020-131-452-110-549; 023-103-648-255-011; 024-118-406-968-439; 026-466-247-941-215; 031-592-787-048-258; 045-075-296-764-754; 046-687-342-420-738; 049-771-162-087-705; 051-824-580-453-278; 052-350-677-816-754; 062-892-104-573-694; 064-524-534-627-895; 070-582-747-582-275; 071-245-262-326-969; 073-443-212-441-213; 081-749-104-701-059; 087-858-111-111-103; 090-925-313-312-769; 094-578-664-433-388; 107-532-685-702-969; 107-745-401-264-178; 143-174-585-408-496; 152-313-615-159-27X; 177-204-095-917-296; 197-392-866-862-614,34

Stuckey; Ary A. Hoffmann; Andrew R. Weeks; Linda J. Thomson,"The homogenous nature of agricultural landscapes generally reduces biodiversity of invertebrate species, but this can be partly offset by developing refuges at field margins. In Australia, shelterbelts are widely planted to provide protection for livestock and to counter salinity problems associated with rising water tables. Shelterbelts may also play a role in acting as reservoirs for organisms that are beneficial to pastures, although this has rarely been directly evaluated. We sampled invertebrates along transects running from replicated shelterbelts into pastures, and in glasshouse trials we tested the impact of the beneficial organisms from the shelterbelts on the collected pests. Contrary to popular views, numbers of pest mites and lucerne fleas were low within shelterbelts. Moreover, numbers were typically lower adjacent to shelterbelts compared with >30 m into the pasture, an effect that was much more apparent when shelterbelts carried a groundcover of high (>30 cm) grass. Numbers of predatory mites and spiders were higher in shelterbelts and in adjacent pasture when there was taller grass and higher grass cover in the shelterbelts. Samples of potential predators collected from a shelterbelt were more effective at suppressing pest mite numbers than those collected in pasture. Shelterbelts with ground cover appear to harbour a diversity of beneficial organisms that suppress pest numbers in adjacent pastures.",46,10,1379,1388,Integrated pest management; Biodiversity; Windbreak; PEST analysis; Groundcover; Pasture; Agroforestry; Agronomy; Transect; Biology; Irrigation,,,,,http://www.livestocklibrary.com.au/handle/1234/22693 https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/EA05137 http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/73/paper/EA05137.htm,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/ea05137,,10.1071/ea05137,1965508103,,0,009-306-296-135-325; 015-524-919-797-599; 017-002-878-840-590; 017-516-181-294-137; 017-989-354-132-620; 019-490-805-815-106; 022-070-333-305-083; 025-983-895-963-761; 029-053-200-785-140; 030-099-453-878-758; 037-198-421-662-475; 046-239-204-276-732; 052-079-246-840-36X; 052-922-849-049-389; 056-892-041-411-85X; 056-892-630-404-500; 057-078-015-807-658; 058-047-121-637-992; 065-717-158-017-31X; 067-088-456-588-245; 068-452-604-669-157; 073-122-963-565-797; 077-277-772-557-227; 080-139-567-968-521; 087-186-786-234-321; 095-026-354-929-83X; 098-481-717-972-161; 099-927-307-717-889; 119-078-259-657-93X; 119-564-560-534-115; 145-653-851-729-665; 150-363-183-035-507; 151-567-169-516-655; 158-611-413-253-35X; 170-196-482-580-53X; 173-672-791-935-14X; 182-059-846-253-826,48
085-963-779-348-786,Gaseous nitrogen and carbon fluxes in riparian alder stands,,2008,journal article,Boreal Environment Research,12396095,,,Ülo Mander; Krista Lõhmus; Sille Teiter; Veiko Uri; Jürgen Augustin,"Riparian buffer zones are considered to be important elements of agricultural watersheds, in that they control nutrient and carbon fluxes. Although the water purification effect of riparian ecosystems has been well studied, there is little knowledge of their internal cycling, especially in the area of gaseous emissions. We measured fluxes of nitrous oxide (N 2 O), dinitrogen (N 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in riparian grey alder stands in southern Estonia and black alder stands in Brandenburg, Germany. Dinitrogen emission was the most important component in N retention in the studied riparian grey alder forests. In 2001-2003, the median values of N 2 emission in the grey alder sites significantly exceeded the N 2 emission rates in the black alder sites, varying from 700 to 1200 and from 360 to 400 kg N 2 -N ha -1 year -1 respectively. In contrast, the median values of N 2 O flux were higher in the black alder sites than in the grey alder sites, i.e., 0.9-2.6 and 0.2-0.7 kg N 2 O-N ha -1 year', respectively. The black alder sites acted as a sink for CH 4 , whereas the grey alder sites emitted a small amount of CH 4 . The CO 2 -C flux was higher in the black alder stands. The estimated N 2 -N emission in the grey alder stands for 1994-1995 was 51.2, whereas N 2 O-N emission was 0.5 kg N ha-' year'. The significant increase in N 2 emission from 1994-1995 to 2001-2003 can be related to changes in microbial activity during the succession of the pioneer grey alder stand into a more stable mixed forest community. Due to CO 2 fluxes and N 2 O fluxes from sites with altered water regime, the estimated GWP of the studied riparian alder stands was relatively high. Further investigations should concentrate on the factors that regulate rates of N 2 O and N 2 emission from riparian buffer zones.",13,3,231,241,Environmental chemistry; Ecosystem; Riparian zone; Nutrient; Nitrous oxide; Riparian buffer; Alder; Hydrology; Environmental science; Carbon dioxide; Cycling,,,,,https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/234735,https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/234735,,,2465955863,,0,005-838-925-915-423; 006-884-315-619-882; 007-526-238-754-541; 009-379-307-440-518; 009-507-114-393-990; 011-231-771-529-816; 015-320-674-315-154; 016-216-735-430-372; 017-273-363-576-238; 021-041-721-037-413; 023-775-979-865-14X; 032-118-714-428-899; 040-105-031-136-536; 040-935-957-450-37X; 043-169-800-248-80X; 044-248-064-596-102; 049-643-530-397-541; 058-265-675-386-65X; 059-441-189-864-333; 064-890-429-355-429; 068-835-407-235-649; 069-729-610-507-600; 076-603-358-516-31X; 090-235-500-995-608; 090-731-128-523-438; 093-184-946-875-581; 096-466-887-764-789; 096-529-479-795-792; 099-615-967-724-432; 102-264-849-132-705; 110-041-337-347-018; 113-793-063-533-825; 116-909-081-419-672; 118-063-654-969-441; 141-101-347-131-583; 145-366-585-809-58X; 169-550-244-567-050; 169-607-559-923-667; 176-345-558-946-644,29

F. Mason; S. M. Macdonald,"The relationships between landscape, land-use and the number of territories of eight species of birds, most with declining populations, were studied over 3 years in an area of largely arable agriculture in eastern England. Two species, skylark Alauda arvensis and yellow wagtail Motacilla flava, established territories within crops. More than half of skylark territories were in autumn-sown cereals, but densities were higher in set-aside and spring-sown crops, while a conservation grassland cut for hay in late July held the highest density. Skylarks did not switch territories in winter cereals for other crops as the breeding season progressed. Weak preferences were found for spring-sown crops and weak avoidance of autumn-sown crops (i.e. there were fewer territories than expected from the area under autumn-sown crops). Skylarks showed preferences for set-aside and conservation grassland but other grassland was avoided. Skylark numbers were negatively associated with hedgerow length within tetrads. Most yellow wagtails nested in spring-sown crops, especially potatoes, for which there was a strong preference; most territories were in the largest fields. More than 75% of territories of turtle dove Streptopelia turtur were associated with residential areas, scrub and woodland, with hedges used much less often than expected from their occurrence. Grass was a strongly preferred land-use. Linnets Carduelis cannabina were mainly located in small areas of scrub and there was an association with winter oil-seed rape. Common whitethroats Sylvia communis showed preferences for hedges, especially for tall hedges, though many territories were situated in field boundaries with only scattered shrubs. Lesser whitethroats S. curruca preferred only tall hedges. Both species had more territories adjacent to grass than expected, with common whitethroat also showing a preference for winter oil-seed rape. Yellowhammers Emberiza citrinella declined over the 3 years of the study. Territories were strongly associated with tall hedges, but preferences for crops were weak. The small number of reed bunting E. schoeniclus territories were almost all by water, with a preference for adjacent grass. Possible mechanisms for reversing the downward trends of bird populations on farmland are discussed.",251,3,339,348,Habitat; Ecology; Woodland; Grassland; Common whitethroat; Alauda; Emberiza citrinella; Streptopelia turtur; Arable land; Biology,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20000711157 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2000.tb01084.x https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2000.tb01084.x https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-zoology/article/influence-of-landscape-and-landuse-on-the-distribution-of-breeding-birds-in-farmland-in-eastern-england/1713AD9F26A1E2A3F250B1CF1E112B7F http://www.journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S095283690000707X http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2000.tb01084.x/full?scrollTo=references https://eurekamag.com/research/003/476/003476665.php http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2000.tb01084.x/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2000.tb01084.x,,10.1111/j.1469-7998.2000.tb01084.x,2137751535,,0,002-234-862-186-238; 002-703-421-233-974; 004-010-787-386-28X; 008-414-929-791-157; 011-305-198-094-715; 014-373-326-060-805; 015-134-696-710-930; 022-667-644-785-266; 028-122-513-556-744; 047-629-763-761-275; 053-191-268-007-391; 067-861-170-428-241; 071-601-656-233-384; 079-343-469-733-772; 091-415-969-356-605; 094-746-201-098-704; 104-575-396-419-535; 105-029-701-298-927; 120-514-812-606-235; 122-352-307-884-641; 127-414-199-688-274; 132-936-270-705-698; 170-044-763-432-805,52

A. Gilfillen; R.W. Rhodes; Robert L. Blevins,"ABSTRACT: Poultry production is increasing in Kentucky. The wastes produced are typically added to soil but surface runoff from agricultural soils treated with poultry waste may exceed water quality standards for fecal indicator bacteria and contribute to agricultural nonpoint-source pollution. While soil erosion in surface runoff is frequently managed by grass filter strips, this management practice may not be an equally effective control for fecal bacteria. We measured soil and fecal coliform trapping in surface runoff from two poultry manure-amended plots in a simulated rain study. The simulation reflected a worst-case event in which poultry waste application was followed by high intensity rain. Grass filter strips, 9 meters long trapped more than 99% of the soil in surface runoff but fecal coliform trapping was less effective. The efficiency of fecal coliform removal from surface runoff was 74% and 43% in the two plots studied. Fecal coliforms in surface runoff always exceeded primary contact water standards of 200 fecal coliforms/100 mL. These data indicated that grass filter strips which adequately controlled sediment runoff were inadequate to bring surface water contaminated with fecal bacteria into compliance with current primary water contact standards.",50,4,405,408,Fecal coliform; Soil water; Indicator bacteria; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science; Biofilter; Surface runoff; Pollution; Surface water,,,,,http://www.jswconline.org/content/50/4/405.abstract https://www.jswconline.org/content/50/4/405,https://www.jswconline.org/content/50/4/405,,,2339606197,,0,,110

Prey biomass and density decreased from the centre of the hedge to the crop margin and to the centre of the crop, where prey density was low but prey biomass was moderate. Starved and satiated beetles were released in circular enclosures and recaptured using pitfall traps for 6 days. 3. Immediately after release, starved P. melanarius were significantly more active than satiated beetles, but this difference disappeared after the first day. At each recapture date, starved individuals had gained weight whereas satiated individuals had lost weight. The analysis of activity and weight variation at the end of the first day indicated that the centre of the crop seemed to be the most favourable habitat for starved individuals to find food rapidly, whereas the behaviour of satiated individuals was identical in all habitats. 4. This experiment shows that habitat use of P. melanarius is flexible. The results are discussed in the context of the classical view of foraging behaviour in carabid beetles. The activity and foraging efficiency in P. melanarius in different habitats can be explained as the result of the interaction between individual satiation state, prey availability in the habitat, and particular preferences of the species.",26,3,235,244,Biomass (ecology); Crop; Foraging; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Context (language use); Mark and recapture; Biology; Predator,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2311.2001.00314.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2311.2001.00314.x,,10.1046/j.1365-2311.2001.00314.x,2024166986,,0,003-387-677-522-07X; 005-028-851-696-576; 009-884-501-807-376; 010-945-646-716-071; 017-032-049-057-221; 019-957-290-510-077; 020-837-897-719-052; 022-035-539-808-467; 023-851-975-669-59X; 028-397-682-880-417; 030-652-847-337-20X; 030-966-936-658-509; 034-136-765-494-548; 037-241-390-682-529; 047-898-549-829-481; 053-830-117-088-153; 064-338-086-975-394; 068-404-335-294-29X; 069-622-233-079-646; 072-817-046-222-302; 076-355-879-729-476; 078-272-079-532-367; 087-186-786-234-321; 101-777-378-567-805; 104-041-676-491-551; 110-684-291-574-379; 114-016-141-114-627; 114-822-732-632-65X; 118-626-208-662-593; 128-109-919-761-712; 134-921-760-522-115; 137-306-932-028-186; 148-532-965-659-739; 150-044-939-802-078; 159-198-285-228-060; 162-166-531-877-501; 180-433-921-201-722,28

Orthoptera populations were monitored using a standardised transect counting procedure in both footpath types to determine whether headland footpaths provided benefits to Orthoptera on intensively managed farmland. Species richness of Orthoptera was significantly higher on headland footpaths (6 species) than on crossfield rights of way (3 species), suggesting that footpaths along the edges of fields may provide refuges in arable farmland. It seems that the absence of regular ploughing on the headland footpaths may be beneficial to mesophilous grasshopper species, the crossfield footpaths constituting too much of an ephemeral habitat (due to annual ploughing and cropping) to support the full range of species. Abundance of all Orthoptera and of individual species was not significantly higher on headland footpaths, although replicates on the sheltered and ...",16,2,127,133,Habitat; Headland; Ecology; Range (biology); Grasshopper; Footpath; Species richness; Transect; Arable land; Biology,,,,,https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Orthoptera-Research/volume-16/issue-2/1082-6467(2007)16[127:OOCAHF]2.0.CO;2/Orthoptera-of-crossfield-and-headland-footpaths-in-arable-farmland/10.1665/1082-6467(2007)16[127:OOCAHF]2.0.CO;2.pdf https://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1665/1082-6467%282007%2916%5B127%3AOOCAHF%5D2.0.CO%3B2 https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/20066575.pdf https://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.1665/1082-6467%282007%2916%5B127%3AOOCAHF%5D2.0.CO%3B2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1665/1082-6467(2007)16[127:oocahf]2.0.co;2,,10.1665/1082-6467(2007)16[127:oocahf]2.0.co;2,2173866403,,0,002-090-255-734-116; 018-355-709-964-605; 022-821-709-291-930; 024-766-871-584-532; 027-570-463-472-624; 028-162-936-771-08X; 035-917-204-510-841; 054-715-078-148-813; 056-236-597-768-277; 061-386-205-110-025; 062-634-061-668-295; 064-021-337-277-094; 073-604-821-738-64X; 079-068-774-342-74X; 102-682-387-421-626; 107-968-640-231-523; 153-497-613-565-827; 155-691-175-864-748; 176-314-956-781-732,7

Baverstock; Suzanne J. Clark; Judith K. Pell,"The ability of the aphid pathogenic fungus Pandora neoaphidis to remain active in the absence of a resting stage through a combination of continuous infection and as conidia deposited on soil was assessed alongside the potential for planted field margins to act as a refuge for the fungus. P. neoaphidis was able to infect the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, when maintained under controlled conditions that simulated those that occur seasonally in the UK. Although there was a significant inverse relationship between temperature and time-to-kill, with death occurring after 4.2, 6.9 and 13.6 days when maintained under fluctuating summer, autumn and winter temperatures, respectively, there were no additional statistically significant effects of photoperiod. The activity of inoculum on soil was indirectly assessed by baiting with A. pisum. Under controlled conditions P. neoaphidis remained active on soil and was able to infect aphids for up to 80 days. However, the percentage of aphids that became infected decreased from 76% on day 1 to 11% on day 80. Whereas there was little difference in the activity of conidia that had been maintained at 4 degrees C and 10 degrees C, activity at 18 degrees C was considerably reduced. Under field conditions the activity of inoculum was strongly influenced by season. On day 49 there was little or no activity during spring, summer or winter. However, during autumn a mean proportion of 0.08 aphids still became infected with P. neoaphidis. Margin type did not affect the activity of conidia nor was there a difference in activity between blocks that had regenerated naturally and those that had been planted. These results suggest that P. neoaphidis can infect aphids and remain active on soil under the abiotic conditions that occur seasonally in the UK and that this fungus may be able to persist annually without a resting stage.",97,3,282,290,Abiotic component; Horticulture; PEST analysis; Aphid; Aphididae; Homoptera; Environmental factor; Acyrthosiphon pisum; Conidium; Botany; Biology,,"Animals; Aphids/microbiology; Ecosystem; Entomophthorales/pathogenicity; Pest Control, Biological; Seasons; Soil Microbiology; Survival; Temperature; United Kingdom",,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council United Kingdom,https://repository.rothamsted.ac.uk/item/89y5w/effect-of-seasonal-abiotic-conditions-and-field-margin-habitat-on-the-activity-of-pandora-neoaphidis-inoculum-on-soil https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022201107001905 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17964597 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17964597/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2007.09.004,17964597,10.1016/j.jip.2007.09.004,2027200132,,0,003-866-396-677-145; 008-642-825-366-53X; 011-578-475-471-878; 018-396-585-333-801; 034-818-000-310-178; 042-435-710-758-606; 043-964-532-176-952; 054-715-078-148-813; 056-585-869-238-25X; 065-902-417-849-327; 069-336-319-141-773; 072-210-408-287-808; 081-346-750-789-589; 089-338-309-894-047; 109-041-077-503-399; 109-191-091-307-929; 109-675-857-542-545; 117-993-897-042-186; 132-561-951-623-016; 144-367-435-584-918; 152-174-341-381-190; 155-691-175-864-748; 162-954-608-509-430; 173-010-046-737-992,23

John Krstansky; Gray S. Henderson; Harold E. Garrett,"A paired watershed study consisting of agroforestry (trees plus grass buffer strips), contour strips (grass buffer strips), and control treatments with a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation was used to examine treatment effects on runoff, sediment, and nutrient losses. During the (1991-1997) calibration and subsequent three-year treatment periods, runoff was measured in 0.91- and 1.37-m H-flumes with bubbler flow meters. Composite samples were analyzed for sediment, total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate, and ammonium. Calibration equations developed to predict runoff, sediment, and nutrients losses explained 66 to 97% of the variability between treatment watersheds. The contour strip and agroforestry treatments reduced runoff by 10 and 1% during the treatment period. In both treatments, most runoff reductions occurred in the second and third years after treatment establishment. The contour strip treatment reduced erosion by 19% in 1999, while erosion in the agroforestry treatment exceeded the predicted loss. Treatments reduced TP loss by 8 and 17% on contour strip and agroforestry watersheds. Treatments did not result in reductions in TN during the first two years of the treatment period. The contour strip and agroforestry treatments reduced TN loss by 21 and 20%, respectively, during a large precipitation event in the third year. During the third year of treatments, nitrate N loss was reduced 24 and 37% by contour strip and agroforestry treatments. Contour strip and agroforestry management practices effectively reduced nonpoint-source pollution in runoff from a corn-soybean rotation in the clay pan soils of northeastern Missouri.",31,4,1214,1225,Soil conservation; No-till farming; Erosion; Crop rotation; Nonpoint source pollution; Alfisol; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Agroforestry; Agronomy,,"Agriculture; Calibration; Ecosystem; Forestry; Models, Theoretical; Nitrogen/analysis; Phosphorus/analysis; Soybeans; Water Movements; Water Pollutants/analysis; Water Pollution/prevention & control; Zea mays",Water Pollutants; Phosphorus; Nitrogen,University of Missouri,https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/31/4/1214 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12175039 https://www.nrem.iastate.edu/class/assets/For460-560/Ecological%20interactions_nutrient%20cycling/Udawatta%20et%20al_2002.pdf https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2002.1214,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2002.1214,12175039,10.2134/jeq2002.1214,2460519688,,0,005-046-617-641-306; 013-193-916-073-759; 013-442-343-608-799; 015-514-563-181-208; 029-811-038-300-984; 043-056-074-783-443; 048-539-299-998-646; 055-486-051-386-205; 057-586-835-109-493; 071-462-069-230-683; 076-826-572-086-275; 077-774-106-623-859; 080-484-175-982-778; 093-805-375-664-818; 095-819-935-363-598; 097-639-369-325-662; 097-972-089-803-438; 111-288-588-656-115; 113-099-437-928-865; 123-304-899-254-597; 129-156-349-985-324; 141-101-347-131-583; 146-805-620-565-604; 153-400-209-057-384; 155-880-575-161-892; 158-219-357-896-783; 169-090-819-139-141; 180-118-726-857-611; 183-143-735-590-924; 192-109-014-802-680; 197-981-050-609-400,206

Non-fertilized strips that were ploughed and either unsown or sown with a grass and meadow herb seed mixture were created in a grass crop field, in order to test the establishment of several meadow herb species, to investigate to what extent creation of sown and unsown strips increased plant species numbers and the number of meadow herbs, and to assess the contribution of species dispersal from an adjacent semi-natural field margin into the created strips. The strips were cut each autumn and plant material removed. Plant species composition was studied in permanent quadrats in the strips and in the surrounding grass crop during four years.

Boughey; Iain R. Lake; Karen A. Haysom; Paul M. Dolman,"Within agricultural landscapes, linear features such as hedgerows and tree-lines provide valuable habitat for many species. We use data from 315 transects, completed as part of a national acoustic survey of bat distribution, to examine the incidence of four bat species adjacent to linear features in rural areas. The use of linear features was assessed in relation to hedgerow width, tree density, the presence of water and woodland proximity. To examine the effect of tree density, linear features were classified as either hedgerows without trees, hedgerows with sparse trees (comprising 50% tree canopy). The use of linear features by Pipistrellus pipstrellus was not affected by tree density; linear features of all types were associated with a similar increase in P. pipistrellus incidence. The use of linear features by Pipistrellus pygmaeus was dependent on both tree density and the proximity of woodland; only linear features containing trees provided an increase in P. pygmaeus incidence regardless of woodland proximity. P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus incidence was not affected by hedgerow width or the presence of water. Incidence of Nyctalus noctula and Eptesicus serotinus was unaffected by the density of linear features of any type. Many agri-environment schemes offer financial incentives for the creation and management of hedgerows. Optimising the biodiversity gain provided by linear features will maximise the effectiveness of these schemes. Agri-environment measures that encourage the provision and retention of hedgerow trees will benefit bats in agricultural landscapes.",144,6,1790,1798,Biodiversity; Habitat; Ecology; Woodland; Geography; Pipistrellus; Pipistrellus pygmaeus; Nyctalus noctula; Eptesicus serotinus; Tree canopy; Agroforestry,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/2776155 https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/29997/ https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND44587910 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320711000784 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320711000784,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2011.02.017,,10.1016/j.biocon.2011.02.017,2008858517,,0,000-103-713-547-965; 000-334-186-344-979; 000-890-614-606-582; 001-636-313-840-757; 002-234-862-186-238; 003-011-276-608-758; 009-104-527-591-059; 012-645-250-423-764; 019-382-878-105-211; 022-220-356-879-89X; 023-255-161-622-361; 023-487-127-123-633; 025-009-993-658-497; 028-693-382-437-241; 029-989-229-132-694; 030-285-119-895-818; 031-197-709-908-814; 033-900-773-196-908; 041-679-397-425-833; 044-616-246-113-964; 046-465-328-233-406; 046-706-622-716-331; 047-949-455-932-004; 050-822-504-039-424; 061-594-202-158-089; 064-157-508-014-006; 065-109-265-277-863; 072-090-852-140-219; 072-110-875-308-497; 073-525-436-724-457; 073-798-803-161-275; 074-793-529-288-006; 078-318-665-214-047; 087-137-801-874-36X; 091-285-676-664-601; 093-839-125-120-370; 095-877-317-702-391; 102-366-533-082-155; 104-243-927-551-084; 107-590-498-378-193; 119-378-630-752-312; 119-744-466-939-755; 124-407-129-963-803; 132-898-566-034-905; 135-697-532-513-252; 140-027-482-120-642; 144-828-533-015-080; 163-060-189-438-706; 195-618-519-387-640,87

Wade French; Norman C. Elliott,"Ground beetles are polyphagous predators that often colonize cereal fields from adjacent habitats. Boundaries separating these habitats may filter the movement of species across them resulting in differences in species composition among the habitats. Ground beetles were captured in spring 1995 at 3 sites, autumn through spring 1995–1996 at 4 sites, and autumn through spring 1996–1997 at 2 sites using pitfall traps positioned in riparian strips, wheat fields, and along riparian-wheat field edges. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to arrange ground beetles along temporal and spatial gradients. Autumn and spring assemblages of ground beetles were separated along the 1st canonical axis. The 2nd canonical axis further separated spring and winter assemblages of ground beetles. With the effects of season removed, ground beetles were classified with respect to habitat association along axes 1 and 2 of a partial canonical correspondence analysis. Based on this analysis, ground beetles occupying wheat field interiors and wheat field edges were separated from those occupying riparian interiors and riparian edges along the 1st canonical axis. The 2nd canonical axis separated beetles occupying interior habitats from those occupying edge habitats. We classified beetles as habitat generalists, wheat specialists, riparian specialists, or boundary specialists. Riparian areas may serve as permanent habitats for ground beetles to colonize cereal fields.

Nash; Linda J. Thomson; Ary A. Hoffmann,"Abstract Carabid beetles are central to the biological control of arable crop pests, in particular slugs. We evaluate three ways of potentially promoting predator numbers: providing conservation strips adjacent to farmland, reducing the number of deleterious chemical sprays and changing tillage practices. In providing growers with management guidelines we also introduce a simple insecticide metric, based on IOBC toxicity ratings, and application number, to assess the biological impacts of agro-chemical usage. Sampling across 20 western Victorian properties, along transects from adjacent remnant grasslands 200 m into arable fields, was seasonally (February and March) biased to the dominant carabid species. Effects of remnant grassland or crop varied among properties, but overall there was a greater abundance of the carabid Notonomus gravis in remnant grasslands, with a reduction in populations as the distance increased into the field. Ordination analyses indicated structure in the predator communities, both in the field and remnant environments, correlated to field chemical use, and tillage. This study demonstrates that beneficial species respond to changes in agronomic practices (e.g. tillage, insecticide) and growers can augment ecosystem services provided by maintaining diverse environments.",46,2,83,93,Tillage; Ordination; Ecology; Grassland; Agroforestry; Ecosystem services; Transect; Arable land; Abundance (ecology); Biology; Predator,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049964408000923 https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/318962-effect-of-remnant-vegetation--pesticides--and-farm-management-on-abundance-of-the-beneficial-predator-notonomus-gravis-(chaudoir)-(coleoptera---carabidae),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2008.03.018,,10.1016/j.biocontrol.2008.03.018,2034176477,,0,002-840-565-989-288; 003-230-277-638-641; 003-815-496-301-575; 005-166-952-755-905; 007-159-731-641-426; 008-225-619-668-580; 010-945-646-716-071; 012-136-156-420-967; 013-526-378-431-354; 014-396-882-188-748; 018-180-493-134-781; 021-933-113-017-949; 022-070-333-305-083; 023-570-963-497-339; 025-911-484-980-097; 028-324-618-068-769; 031-715-316-035-351; 031-858-853-815-220; 033-734-519-816-998; 035-086-311-455-310; 036-235-097-727-831; 040-572-453-396-234; 042-287-420-054-457; 042-985-809-167-140; 043-329-639-022-790; 056-789-845-462-569; 058-047-121-637-992; 058-743-931-737-265; 060-626-812-234-007; 064-893-774-544-494; 070-194-102-378-889; 072-817-046-222-302; 073-751-788-533-828; 075-276-217-181-614; 080-139-567-968-521; 085-961-686-904-115; 087-186-786-234-321; 094-066-480-808-852; 105-606-337-287-881; 107-575-706-718-020; 114-646-769-502-277; 116-384-645-347-944; 117-345-687-903-78X; 129-989-505-935-254; 134-797-888-874-528; 134-921-760-522-115; 135-277-247-218-421; 138-953-342-619-880; 139-370-690-432-15X; 149-431-649-896-445; 151-044-818-418-228; 153-991-299-674-892; 159-198-285-228-060; 162-135-862-460-59X; 173-731-784-504-55X; 174-706-848-200-347; 194-158-821-575-940,36

Wes Burger; Eric T. Linder,"Upland habitat buffers (i.e., strips of noncrop, herbaceous vegetation) that are established adjacent to wooded fencerows offer landowners an economical option to provide wildlife benefits within intensive agricultural landscapes. However, being located near a wooded edge may increase grassland bird vulnerability to edge effects through reduced nest survival. We examined nesting bird communities in field margins adjacent to wooded field edges with no buffer (i.e., control), narrow (approx. 10-m) buffers, and wide (approx. 30-m) buffers in an intensive agricultural system in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley, United States. Dickcissel (Spiza americana) and red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) accounted for 97% of nests. Nest density was >7 times greater in wide buffers than in narrow. We modeled nest survival in Program MARK as a function of time (yr and season), nest-site, and local vegetation characteristics. Nest survival was influenced by among- and within-season temporal effects and local vegetation structure, but not by buffer width. Nest success varied substantially between years and within seasons for dickcissel (12.9% and 19.1% early in the seasons of 2003 and 2004, respectively), but not for red-winged blackbird (15.1%). Overall nest-success estimates were similar to noncrop, herbaceous strips elsewhere in the United States, though whether or not these estimates represent population sinks remains uncertain. Based on this research, we advocate integrating upland habitat buffers within intensive agricultural landscapes and emphasize the use of wide buffers when grassland-nesting birds are a conservation priority. 2011 The Wildlife Society.",35,4,353,361,Vegetation; Nest; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Grassland; Agelaius; Population; Wildlife; Bird nest,,,,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wsb.87 https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wsb.87 https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wsb.87,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wsb.87,,10.1002/wsb.87,2117207293,,0,000-006-765-483-604; 000-281-554-875-962; 003-510-625-031-181; 007-289-445-927-744; 007-800-039-741-720; 011-287-863-694-168; 013-667-690-724-142; 017-298-227-855-778; 020-808-060-559-98X; 024-603-870-603-934; 026-609-010-582-360; 028-035-318-672-656; 028-571-906-311-784; 031-592-787-048-258; 032-694-333-724-243; 033-989-874-629-980; 034-379-611-675-940; 035-031-653-430-246; 041-849-081-349-271; 042-706-259-099-168; 047-000-620-546-182; 049-237-220-747-071; 056-857-289-032-665; 064-163-755-769-570; 065-890-360-780-473; 068-811-888-710-634; 074-241-310-816-85X; 074-781-117-503-488; 080-042-362-305-74X; 081-036-665-417-533; 084-250-234-469-178; 093-959-883-434-80X; 094-514-405-858-493; 111-770-649-109-293; 115-123-313-615-824; 118-261-652-484-157; 118-607-171-279-166; 128-222-836-109-002; 133-025-020-758-454; 133-199-519-838-349; 140-804-099-486-389; 140-881-489-636-820; 141-760-573-202-465; 146-882-656-337-936; 148-639-915-345-985; 149-594-572-892-345; 166-152-846-701-103; 173-117-656-524-396; 190-958-809-912-094,11

Hedges and forest remnants may mitigate biodiversity loss by enhancing landscape heterogeneity and providing habitat to a wide range of species, including birds. However, nest predation, the major cause of reproductive failure of birds, has been shown to be higher in forest edges than in forest interiors. Little is known about how spatial arrangement (configuration) of hedges affects the avian nest predation. We performed an experiment with artificial ground and elevated nests (resembling yellowhammer and whitethroat nests) baited with quail and plasticine eggs. Nests were placed in three habitat types with different degrees of isolation from forests: forest edges, hedges connected to forests and hedges isolated from forests. Nest predation was highest in forest edges, lowest in hedges connected to forests and intermediate in isolated hedges. In the early breeding season, we found similar nest predation on ground and elevated nests, but in the late breeding season nest predation was higher on ground nests than on elevated nests. Small mammals were the main predators of ground nests and appeared to be responsible for the increase in predation from early to late breeding season, whereas the elevated nests were mainly depredated by small birds and small mammals. High predation pressure at forest edges was probably caused by both forest and open-landscape predators. The influence of forest predators may be lower at hedges, leading to lower predation pressure than in forest edges. Higher predation pressure in isolated than connected hedges might be an effect of concentration of predators in these isolated habitats. We conclude that landscape configuration of hedges is important in nest predation, with connected hedges allowing higher survival than isolated hedges and forest edges.",45,45,50,56,Seasonal breeder; Biodiversity; Nest; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Yellowhammer; Plasticine; Bird nest; Biology,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1146609X12001105 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/1116869 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AcO....45...50L/abstract https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1146609X12001105 https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-253e3029-ede2-30a5-bd9b-43ba007cb568,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2012.08.008,,10.1016/j.actao.2012.08.008,1983405300,,0,001-626-811-932-241; 008-225-619-668-580; 012-390-404-634-862; 017-193-500-641-586; 019-860-110-110-463; 019-925-489-194-685; 020-938-492-722-870; 022-680-725-650-829; 026-766-790-225-506; 030-831-977-852-027; 031-592-787-048-258; 032-590-712-791-490; 039-385-564-295-146; 041-679-397-425-833; 041-728-890-038-763; 047-000-620-546-182; 051-149-708-871-297; 051-750-139-155-449; 054-496-434-177-85X; 059-796-555-907-739; 060-340-763-373-559; 066-388-810-753-310; 067-026-574-979-251; 068-172-042-516-91X; 068-452-604-669-157; 071-604-253-914-381; 074-924-636-701-465; 075-168-083-087-797; 075-762-658-321-41X; 079-554-414-954-690; 082-338-894-351-339; 082-484-240-847-058; 083-616-222-476-247; 088-531-905-159-215; 089-945-115-385-599; 090-638-399-212-299; 092-134-681-380-206; 099-605-273-789-62X; 102-181-065-176-319; 106-081-154-740-548; 111-055-494-060-639; 113-742-530-077-516; 117-006-806-257-463; 120-467-101-353-965; 125-870-205-356-222; 127-287-507-350-445; 136-846-670-164-129; 143-250-679-860-16X; 152-072-465-980-93X; 156-624-196-949-616; 168-314-870-071-254; 169-088-517-056-428,28

Field margins were subjected to 10 grassland management regimes, which included the effects of spraying the herbicide glyphosate, cutting, leaving vegetation in situ after the cut, sowing and a control. These treatments were randomised within six complete blocks at the University of Oxford's farm at Wytham. Cutting vegetation had an immediate effect on number of L. tenuis in both spring and summer. Cutting margins in summer had a more persistent effect on populations of L. tenuis than did cutting margins in spring. The effect of cutting was not mitigated by leaving cut vegetation in situ, but no cutting ensured higher number of L. tenuis in margins, an indication that height and structural complexity of grassland vegetation were important in determining population size. Significantly fewer spiders were found in July and September plots which had been sprayed with herbicide in late June/early July. However, spider numbers were not affected by glyphosate application when samples were taken nearly a year later. Sowing a wildflower seed mixture had no significant effects on number of this generalist predator although other invertebrate groups did benefit. Field margins provided an excellent source habitat for L. tenuis. Habitats that border crop fields acted as a refugia for many other beneficial invertebrates and should be retained as an important component of the agricultural landscape. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Plots of D. glomerata and H. lanatus remained virtually mono- specific. 4 Over the period of study, the beetle bank maintained its role in providing overwintering habitat for polyphagous predators and carabid diversity has increased since the bank was first established.

Barbercheck,"Abstract Insects killed by entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) represent a resource with which soil arthropods can interact. These interactions can be positive for EPN (e.g., arthropods serve as parasitic or phoretic hosts) or negative (e.g., EPN serve as prey). Plant diversity and soil disturbance may influence these interactions. We investigated the effects of maize and flower strip habitats on microarthropod abundance and community composition in soil surrounding greater wax moth larvae, Galleria mellonella, infected with the EPN Steinernema carpocapsae (Sc). In the first year of the experiment (2005), we compared microarthropod communities responding to burial of Sc-killed insects with a control (no soil disturbance). In 2006, we added two control treatments: burial of freezer-killed insects and sham burial. Soil samples (including G. mellonella) were collected 2 and 20 days (2005) or 2 and 12 days (2006) after application. In 2005, arthropod abundance and community composition were similar between maize and flower strip habitats. In 2006, we detected more arthropods in the maize than the flower strips. In both years, community composition differed between treatments providing resources (Sc-killed and freezer-killed insects) and those without (sham burial and no disturbance), with the greatest difference on the final sampling date. Soil surrounding Sc-killed and freezer-killed insects contained more dipterans, acarid mites, staphylinid beetles, onychiurid and entomobryid collembolans, and immature and male mesostigmatid mites than soil at sham burial and no disturbance sites. Most of these taxa are capable of nematophagy; however, EPN relative abundance was not associated with arthropod community composition.",54,4,243,251,Relative species abundance; Larva; Predation; Arthropod; Galleria mellonella; Entomopathogenic nematode; Acari; Agronomy; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/soil-microarthropod-response-to-the-application-of-entomopathogen https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031405611000308,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pedobi.2011.04.001,,10.1016/j.pedobi.2011.04.001,2044744144,,0,000-781-155-628-842; 003-910-379-834-095; 005-383-373-750-131; 006-352-634-429-704; 007-655-315-856-201; 009-017-538-583-796; 011-606-709-082-88X; 013-227-533-723-518; 016-321-244-548-16X; 020-264-452-620-337; 022-382-893-396-756; 026-218-859-067-327; 026-400-597-530-713; 026-997-502-315-485; 028-100-277-735-793; 029-264-530-643-997; 029-492-842-060-912; 029-644-403-983-299; 031-982-852-878-885; 032-236-559-361-926; 032-962-872-054-89X; 035-151-987-240-828; 044-877-550-251-54X; 046-908-039-204-14X; 048-135-529-099-777; 051-012-131-501-111; 056-892-630-404-500; 058-745-953-063-619; 060-997-589-015-33X; 061-671-244-259-925; 062-036-445-726-722; 063-617-276-329-073; 071-111-073-722-141; 071-693-871-219-228; 073-422-444-282-423; 077-087-903-690-89X; 085-389-648-394-965; 086-504-897-125-43X; 096-480-344-776-880; 100-618-781-127-071; 103-450-292-596-814; 109-112-697-690-717; 112-589-170-687-294; 119-238-416-473-06X; 119-286-057-947-142; 120-102-912-732-000; 120-883-818-841-280; 121-097-096-216-448; 121-691-035-270-645; 135-233-059-071-616; 136-816-007-966-101; 137-648-808-210-685; 138-953-342-619-880; 140-357-675-055-076; 148-849-031-329-133; 151-119-044-465-189; 152-970-859-912-74X; 159-014-795-692-016; 174-324-484-824-816; 174-930-173-296-817; 178-481-741-662-358; 183-067-187-011-669; 183-255-886-219-010; 189-705-231-003-183,9

Interactions between fleshy-fruited plants and frugivorous birds are highly seasonal in temperate ecosystems. Nevertheless, combined effects of landscape modification and seasonal variation on plant-frugivore interactions have never been assessed from a network perspective. Here, we present the first study that simultaneously investigates effects of landscape modification and seasonal variation on plant-frugivore interactions and on functional and interaction diversity of plant-frugivore networks. We recorded visitation rates of 39 frugivorous bird species to 28 fruiting-plant species in Central Germany from early summer to late autumn in hedgerows within three landscape types arranged along a gradient of decreasing anthropogenic modification and increasing structural diversity (i.e., farmland, orchard, forest edge). We analyzed how species richness, abundance, and community composition, as well as functional and interaction diversity of fruiting plants and frugivorous birds changed with landscape type, fruit availability, and season. We found that visitation rates of frugivorous birds were lower in farmland, but only in summer. In autumn, visitation rates were similar in all landscape types and strongly increased with increasing local fruit availability. The functional diversity of fruits and frugivorous birds and their interaction diversity remained surprisingly constant in all landscape types. Due to seasonal changes in communities of fruiting plants and frugivorous birds, functional dispersion of fruiting plants was lower in autumn than in summer, whereas functional richness and dispersion of frugivorous birds was higher in autumn than in summer. Our results indicate that seasonal changes in fruit availability influence the abundance of frugivorous birds along gradients of structural diversity at the landscape scale. Although seasonal fluctuations influenced the functional diversity of avian frugivore communities, we found constant interaction diversity of plant-frugivore networks in space and time, probably due to the functional redundancy of frugivorous birds. These findings indicate a high robustness of avian frugivory to moderate levels of human-induced landscape modification in temperate ecosystems and call for studies testing the generality of these findings for ultimate avian seed dispersal functions.",94,6,1296,1306,Ecosystem; Biodiversity; Frugivore; Seed dispersal; Ecology; Orchard; Species richness; Abundance (ecology); Temperate climate; Biology,,Animals; Birds/physiology; Demography; Ecosystem; Feeding Behavior/physiology; Fruit; Germany; Time Factors,,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/12-1213.1 https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:52a5e89 http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/12-1213.1 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/12-1213.1/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23923493 https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1890/12-1213.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/12-1213.1,23923493,10.1890/12-1213.1,2043175460,,0,002-155-103-652-773; 004-073-731-578-889; 004-951-469-878-072; 006-353-514-480-649; 006-651-756-625-332; 007-661-571-004-201; 008-225-619-668-580; 011-193-132-664-152; 012-662-529-735-954; 012-801-000-483-803; 013-267-136-894-344; 013-576-433-554-839; 013-699-880-107-301; 015-335-321-886-527; 029-136-104-232-881; 032-452-486-736-649; 033-765-534-094-227; 034-166-519-290-467; 037-751-281-974-653; 043-334-181-578-717; 043-686-913-320-033; 043-811-590-231-051; 045-823-211-221-277; 049-422-617-755-023; 051-078-158-132-063; 051-545-859-164-711; 051-867-920-489-999; 054-948-494-071-795; 058-715-755-791-116; 062-235-971-721-755; 069-654-484-205-375; 071-307-992-550-410; 086-626-249-909-151; 087-205-024-828-239; 090-053-282-490-718; 099-595-251-946-405; 111-617-655-286-770; 116-926-790-022-402; 125-280-614-407-73X; 125-307-019-970-496; 128-141-135-206-235; 129-590-087-338-777; 132-266-263-956-843; 158-880-519-987-365,52

Here we aim to assess and to compare two riparian gray alder forests in terms of gaseous N2O and N2 fluxes and dissolved N2O, N2, and NO3(-) in the near-surface groundwater. We further determine for the first time isotopologue ratios of N2O dissolved in the riparian groundwater in order to support our assumption that it mainly originated from denitrification. The study sites, both situated in Estonia, northeastern Europe, receive contrasting N loads from adjacent uphill arable land. Whereas N2O emissions were rather small at both sites, average gaseous N2-to-N2O ratios inferred from closed-chamber measurements and He-O laboratory incubations were almost four times smaller for the heavily loaded site. In contrast, groundwater parameters were less variable among sites and between landscape positions. Campaign-based average (15)N site preferences of N2O (SP) in riparian groundwater ranged between 11 and 44 ‰. Besides the strong prevalence of N2 emission over N2O fluxes and the correlation pattern between isotopologue and water quality data, this comparatively large range highlights the importance of denitrification and N2O reduction in both riparian gray alder stands.",48,20,11910,11918,Riparian zone; Isotopologue; Riparian buffer; Alder; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science; Biogeochemical cycle; Denitrification; Groundwater,,Alnus; Denitrification; Estonia; Forests; Groundwater/analysis; Nitrogen/analysis; Nitrous Oxide/analysis; Water Quality,Nitrous Oxide; Nitrogen,Eesti Teadusagentuur; International Atomic Energy Agency; European Regional Development Fund,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014EnST...4811910M/abstract http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25264900 https://www.openagrar.de/receive/timport_mods_00016628;lang=en https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es501727h https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25264900/ https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es501727h,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es501727h,25264900,10.1021/es501727h,2317437528,,0,002-005-853-637-878; 002-366-294-773-665; 002-465-212-013-00X; 002-731-293-073-248; 004-523-212-466-872; 006-688-348-516-945; 006-825-017-640-341; 007-403-798-453-456; 008-504-704-938-364; 008-617-825-775-304; 009-846-801-819-099; 013-260-780-903-510; 013-569-308-091-630; 016-216-735-430-372; 016-475-292-873-68X; 019-383-616-272-778; 021-227-002-702-937; 023-641-587-231-128; 024-906-344-175-448; 027-232-382-411-166; 032-118-714-428-899; 032-816-681-005-029; 033-852-190-137-232; 035-194-028-938-331; 036-672-271-091-943; 041-269-407-206-633; 046-107-508-478-558; 047-749-701-907-44X; 047-851-698-335-006; 048-303-352-583-378; 048-651-582-360-672; 054-771-763-380-289; 056-252-702-000-48X; 058-474-788-983-515; 060-952-324-761-506; 065-333-385-502-531; 073-951-021-776-062; 075-015-864-957-620; 076-038-286-153-572; 078-150-849-939-070; 078-152-482-493-656; 081-844-543-150-450; 085-043-531-960-312; 085-963-779-348-786; 086-480-436-472-654; 096-731-430-423-17X; 096-941-151-795-830; 106-090-932-098-26X; 112-819-683-422-372; 118-063-654-969-441; 120-264-449-693-944; 132-435-645-019-657; 132-680-083-050-386; 141-101-347-131-583; 144-130-211-106-188; 145-366-585-809-58X; 150-539-908-471-485; 152-767-761-688-811; 158-638-348-017-405; 168-744-837-424-994; 169-550-244-567-050; 173-345-063-498-473; 178-782-932-225-686; 183-286-065-377-769; 185-411-059-834-313,17

We studied the influence of live fence characteristics on species richness and fence use by birds by examining both local and landscape factors. We studied three types of live fences: planted fences of a native tree, planted fences of an exotic, and spontaneous. They were either connected to forest fragments or isolated, and were all within a pasture matrix. Spontaneous and planted live fences maintain a diverse plant (77 shrub and tree species) and bird communities (98 species). Fence types strongly differed in vegetation composition and structure. We found that by analyzing each fence characteristic independently, there was no difference in bird richness or abundance. However, there was a significant correlation when plant richness, structure, and connectivity were analyzed together. This could be the result of some variables counterbalancing each other. Birds used fences for a variety of purposes including foraging, breeding, and moving across the landscape. Native birds and plants used live fences as habitat and refuge in a landscape where large forest tracts have been lost for decades. Live fences in conjunction with small forest fragments maintain a diverse array of plant and birds species that are a subsample of the species originally found in the landscape before extensive deforestation. We recommend the establishment of live fences, allowing growth of spontaneous understory.",81,1,15,30,Biodiversity; Deforestation; Understory; Introduced species; Habitat; Ecology; Shrub; Species richness; Agroforestry; Species diversity; Biology,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20113038540.html https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-010-9331-x https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20113038540 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10457-010-9331-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-010-9331-x,,10.1007/s10457-010-9331-x,2033267238,,0,003-435-503-409-943; 005-180-522-959-909; 006-255-253-311-118; 008-264-461-476-221; 026-162-389-848-750; 028-438-913-403-035; 032-540-380-428-357; 044-049-389-716-000; 050-532-464-266-167; 056-753-394-412-786; 058-835-062-345-89X; 065-985-181-262-074; 066-085-915-081-348; 071-601-656-233-384; 073-798-803-161-275; 087-892-864-525-502; 088-254-084-347-346; 110-766-047-364-379; 115-035-843-702-028; 120-026-196-989-144; 124-544-035-225-130; 129-248-797-500-018; 137-558-982-560-489; 146-377-706-035-42X; 156-624-196-949-616; 187-050-769-304-212; 196-882-208-161-504,38

Dillaha; Saied Mostaghimi,"An 18-month field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of grass filter strips in removing sediment and various nitrogen species from runoff. Runoff was collected from six 3.7 m wide experimental plots with 24.7 m long runoff source areas. Two plots had 8.5 m filters, two plots had 4.3 m filters, and two plots had no filters. Runoff was analyzed for total suspended solids (TSS), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), filtered TKN (FTKN), NH 4 + -N, and NO 3 - -N. The Mann-Kendall nonparametric test for trend (changes in filter effectiveness over time) indicated that there were no trends in the yields and concentrations of TSS, NO 3 - -N, NH 4 + -N, TKN, and FTKN for the 8.5 m filter over time. For the shorter 4.3 m filters, there were significant upward trends in TKN yield and downward trends in TSS, NH 4 + -N, and FTKN concentrations, indicating that trapping efficiency may have started changing with time. The Kruskal-Wallis test indicated that the 8.5 m filters reduced median yields and concentrations of TSS and all N species, but the 4.3 m filters only reduced the median yields and concentrations of TSS, NH 4 + -N, TKN, and the median concentration of FTKN. The 8.5 and 4.3 m filters reduced contaminate yields and concentrations from 42 to 90 percent and from 20 to 83 percent, respectively.",35,4,867,875,Animal science; Kjeldahl method; Water quality; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Total suspended solids; Surface runoff; Nitrogen; Field experiment,,,,,https://www.tucson.ars.ag.gov/unit/Publications/PDFfiles/1230.pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999JAWRA..35..867M/abstract http://www.tucson.ars.ag.gov/unit/Publications/PDFfiles/1230.pdf https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1999.tb04180.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1999.tb04180.x,,10.1111/j.1752-1688.1999.tb04180.x,2009869663,,0,007-550-413-175-53X; 014-561-967-561-763; 034-748-846-517-673; 076-826-572-086-275; 097-054-825-053-530; 176-609-653-505-894,45

The purpose of this study was to determine if narrow BS would effectively remove dissolved inorganic N from subsurface lateral flow. Nitrate–N (NO3–N) and ammonia–N (NH3–N) concentrations in subsurface lateral flow were measured at 1 m depth in a BS system consisting of five treatments: G: strip of grass (Fescue arundinacea); GS: strip of grass and line of native shrubs (Fuchsia magellanica); GST1: strip of grass, line of shrubs and line of native trees 1 (Luma chequen); GST2: strip of grass, line of shrubs and line of native trees 2 (Drimys winteri); and C: bare soil as control. Water samples for the NO3–N and NH3–N measurements were collected between June 2012 and August 2014 in observation wells located at the inlet (input) and outlet (output) of each treatment. The analyses showed that vegetated BS had NO3–N removal efficiency ranging from 33 to 67 % (mean 52 %), with the G treatment showing the best performance in reducing NO3–N concentrations in subsurface lateral flow. The BS treatments were not effective in reducing NH3–N concentrations. The results suggested that N uptake by grass is the main process associated with the NO3–N retention capacity of vegetated BS.",102,3,359,370,Inlet; Nitrate; Drimys winteri; Fuchsia magellanica; Water quality; Filter strip; Hydrology; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Nitrogen; Agronomy,,,,FONDECYT de Iniciación 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10705-015-9707-4/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10705-015-9707-4 http://repositorio.uchile.cl/bitstream/2250/134809/1/Inorganic-nitrogen-losses.pdf http://repositorio.uchile.cl/bitstream/handle/2250/134809/Inorganic-nitrogen-losses.pdf;sequence=1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-015-9707-4,,10.1007/s10705-015-9707-4,1957296552,,0,000-386-981-898-342; 008-467-759-539-985; 011-275-006-165-28X; 014-286-035-791-303; 015-961-075-985-447; 017-944-190-097-742; 019-822-983-363-120; 023-617-088-267-054; 027-202-865-752-996; 027-635-671-861-290; 030-010-201-130-934; 034-395-375-552-606; 036-060-922-824-075; 041-606-538-207-737; 044-327-313-877-518; 047-140-385-589-012; 050-731-484-733-377; 053-913-477-019-454; 055-290-465-789-317; 056-572-672-082-930; 058-699-683-886-484; 062-053-149-473-032; 063-696-030-089-573; 073-703-019-282-474; 085-934-890-321-44X; 098-804-301-113-543; 109-959-273-104-714; 113-057-949-435-76X; 121-071-106-816-020; 121-619-354-892-752; 123-943-003-764-342; 124-183-569-651-141; 130-556-854-061-702; 135-426-217-842-676; 135-626-021-164-523; 138-643-821-809-522; 147-798-944-287-042; 168-147-444-528-148; 176-961-483-594-048; 191-724-085-796-327,13

Il est donc important d’adapter la gestion de ces habitats afin de beneficier au mieux des services fournis par la diversite de ces auxiliaires. L’objectif de cette these est de comprendre comment la gestion des bandes enherbees permet d’ameliorer le service du controle biologique delivre par les carabes. Nous avons d’abord examine par quels mecanismes, les changements dans la diversite fonctionnelle des carabes augmentent leur capacite de suppression de ravageurs. Ainsi, a ete comparee au laboratoire, l’efficience de predation sur une population de proie, par des assemblages de carabes qui ont differents niveaux de diversite de taille. Par ailleurs, a travers une experimentation mise en place dans des champs de cereales, nous avons etudie les effets de cinq modes de gestion des bandes enherbees sur la structure vegetale de ces habitats non cultives, et par consequent sur la structure des communautes carabiques. Nos resultats revelent l’absence d’une partition de ressources entre les carabes de tailles differentes. La quantite et de la taille de proies consommees augmente avec la taille des carabes. La suppression des proies a ainsi ete fortement augmentee par la presence des carabes de grande taille dans les assemblages. Ces resultats suggerent que l’augmentation de la diversite de taille chez les carabes augmente leur efficience de predation par l’effet d’echantillonnage. Nous avons mis en evidence une redondance fonctionnelle entre les especes de carabes. Cette redondance permet de reduire la variabilite spatio-temporelle dans la fonction de regulation exercee sur les populations de ravageurs. L’importance des bandes enherbees en tant qu’habitat pour plusieurs especes de carabes importantes pour le controle biologique, a ete mise en evidence. La gestion influence les carabes seulement dans les bandes enherbees. La diversite fonctionnelle des plantes au sein de ces bandes enherbees a ete identifiee comme le principal facteur favorisant la richesse specifique des carabes. L’activite-densite des carabes a, par ailleurs, ete favorisee par une vegetation peu heterogene et un pourcentage eleve de sol nu. Les carabes de tailles differentes divergent dans leur reponse a la structure de la vegetation. Cette divergence semble etre liee aussi a la variation d'autres traits d'histoire de vie des especes (i.e. regime alimentaire). Les connaissances et les resultats produits dans le cadre de ce travail de these, serviront au developpement d’indicateurs mesurant l’impact des pratiques de gestion sur le controle biologique exerce par les carabes",,,,,,,,,,https://hal.univ-lorraine.fr/tel-01751605 http://www.theses.fr/2015LORR0048 https://hal.univ-lorraine.fr/tel-01751605/document,https://hal.univ-lorraine.fr/tel-01751605,,,570211143,,0,,0

Sobota; Sherri L. Johnson; Stan V. Gregory; Linda R. Ashkenas,"The influence of land use on potential fates of nitrate (NO3−) in stream ecosystems, ranging from denitrification to storage in organic matter, has not been documented extensively. Here, we describe the Pacific Northwest component of Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment, phase II (LINX II) to examine how land-use setting influences fates of NO3− in streams. We used 24 h releases of a stable isotope tracer (15NO3-N) in nine streams flowing through forest, agricultural, and urban land uses to quantify NO3− uptake processes. NO3− uptake lengths varied two orders of magnitude (24–4247 m), with uptake rates (6.5–158.1 mg NO3-N m−2 day−1) and uptake velocities (0.1–2.3 mm min−1) falling within the ranges measured in other LINX II regions. Denitrification removed 0–7% of added tracer from our streams. In forest streams, 60.4 to 77.0% of the isotope tracer was exported downstream as NO3−, with 8.0 to 14.8% stored in wood biofilms, epilithon, fine benthic organic matter, and bryophytes. Agricultural and urban streams with streamside forest buffers displayed hydrologic export and organic matter storage of tracer similar to those measured in forest streams. In agricultural and urban streams with a partial or no riparian buffer, less than 1 to 75% of the tracer was exported downstream; much of the remainder was taken up and stored in autotrophic organic matter components with short N turnover times. Our findings suggest restoration and maintenance of riparian forests can help re-establish the natural range of NO3− uptake processes in human-altered streams.",15,1,1,17,Riparian zone; Riparian forest; Ecology; Stable isotope ratio; Riparian buffer; TRACER; Hydrology; Environmental science; STREAMS; Organic matter; Denitrification,,,,,https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/journals/pnw_2012_sobota.pdf https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/downloads/dj52w513w http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/pubs/pdf/pub4468.pdf https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10021-011-9489-8.pdf https://srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/42616 https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/36280 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10021-011-9489-8 https://core.ac.uk/display/10196523 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/10196523.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-011-9489-8,,10.1007/s10021-011-9489-8,2169032145,,0,001-866-369-338-225; 004-297-767-325-018; 005-367-762-394-433; 006-239-529-929-294; 012-831-298-904-339; 016-609-663-252-542; 017-729-458-323-957; 019-156-536-970-20X; 020-821-795-318-083; 021-212-060-608-568; 022-200-815-475-651; 022-890-434-087-998; 022-990-055-217-404; 023-013-774-832-327; 023-522-338-024-37X; 024-014-902-869-37X; 024-313-336-029-375; 028-595-682-652-50X; 036-113-975-033-046; 036-992-696-438-466; 037-510-361-635-996; 038-592-289-940-23X; 051-894-767-795-028; 053-952-763-153-568; 054-734-988-762-074; 055-672-075-552-705; 057-131-405-354-025; 059-109-310-001-958; 060-075-144-246-898; 062-551-448-613-228; 065-333-859-714-879; 068-216-756-065-825; 073-537-316-098-47X; 090-809-533-673-461; 092-778-984-444-098; 096-743-675-311-342; 100-548-330-071-59X; 103-540-665-184-521; 104-034-796-915-51X; 110-537-300-337-747; 115-292-006-410-025; 115-612-393-933-466; 122-283-490-287-901; 124-053-051-855-574; 125-176-722-077-07X; 132-172-647-864-385; 134-121-624-978-585; 136-817-885-782-140; 140-865-906-086-947; 155-385-501-323-897; 190-961-672-237-856; 193-242-118-369-606; 195-888-089-631-630,45

Beltramo; Isabel Bertolaccini; Alda González,"Trials during two consecutive soybean cycles were performed in central Santa Fe in order to determine the main spider families present in the crop and to determine the influence of spontaneous margin flora on colonization towards the lot. Samplings were done by sweeping net and pitfall traps. It was concluded that:1. Oxyopidae was the most frequent family in the herbaceous layer of both the margins and the soybean crop, and Lycosidae in the lower layer; 2. Margin strips in a soybean lot contribute to the colonization of the crop by spiders of aerial habits and also promote re-colonization following pesticide applications, since they act as shelters. The influence on spiders of terrestrial habits was somewhat lower; 3. The distribution of the populations of spiders of terrestrial habits was homogeneous in a soybean crop seeded directly and these predators had a greater capacity to control pests at all points of the lot.",66,3,891,898,Agriculture; Biodiversity; Crop; Flora; Vegetation; Predation; Ecology; Colonization; Spider; Agronomy; Biology,,"Animals; Argentina; Behavior, Animal/physiology; Biodiversity; Crops, Agricultural; Models, Biological; Soybeans; Spiders/classification",,,https://www.scielo.br/j/bjb/a/VQcf7ZTvHBH9BxmmQZ5pBFp/ http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/83113 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17119837/ https://biblat.unam.mx/es/revista/brazilian-journal-of-biology/articulo/spiders-of-soybean-crops-in-santa-fe-province-argentina-influence-of-surrounding-spontaneous-vegetation-on-lot-colonization https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17119837 http://www.scielo.br/j/bjb/a/VQcf7ZTvHBH9BxmmQZ5pBFp/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/s1519-69842006000500015,17119837,10.1590/s1519-69842006000500015,2134264475,,0,009-765-572-353-250; 012-812-547-625-311; 015-888-533-237-30X; 019-286-238-463-002; 020-560-024-356-265; 023-342-015-474-95X; 027-164-254-872-513; 028-028-864-238-974; 034-469-186-069-921; 035-512-326-342-385; 037-531-348-698-055; 047-189-425-254-573; 047-547-874-345-558; 058-331-309-573-378; 079-852-780-344-054; 086-966-545-410-903; 096-363-234-585-909; 103-551-824-614-538; 109-046-757-673-685; 140-346-515-601-003; 142-114-724-301-808; 150-713-634-912-968; 155-933-298-887-367; 166-193-746-968-362,21

When rain falls on burnt pastures, it can lead to increased pollutant transport in runoff. However, this transport can be modified by vegetative buffers which intercept the runoff downslope of burnt areas. This study examines the effects of different pasture buffer lengths (0, 2, and 5 m) on sediment and chemical transport from two pasture sites near Wivenhoe Dam, the main water reservoir for Brisbane City. Simulated rainfall (100 mm/h) was applied to 18 plots on pasture sites after they were burnt, and insoluble and soluble components were measured in the runoff. Most eroded sediment/organic debris accumulated against the first row of the grass buffer strips or was deposited in the upslope backwater region. Buffer length had little impact on the runoff concentrations of NO3– and NO2– (NOx), total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and total nitrogen from the 5-m-length upslope plots but was significant for sediment loss rate, filterable reactive phosphate, ammonium, and total and dissolved organic carbon. Pasture type was significant for NOx, ammonium, sediment loss rate, and total organic carbon only. Burning increased enrichment ratios of nutrients and carbon in the runoff compared with unburnt plots, but a 2-m buffer strip subsequently reduced the enrichment ratio values by >30%. Buffers strips of unburnt pasture grass may provide an effective tool for post-fire erosion control following prescribed burning; however, further work including scaling to larger plot sizes and catchment level is required.",49,6,513,522,Erosion; Soil water; Pasture; Erosion control; Sediment; Dissolved organic carbon; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Agronomy,,,,,https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/42526 http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/84/paper/SR11122.htm https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/bitstream/10072/42526/1/73977_1.pdf https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR11122,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/sr11122,,10.1071/sr11122,1987985932,,0,003-679-788-124-01X; 003-744-250-094-152; 003-861-458-202-696; 004-114-457-523-647; 014-173-793-490-314; 021-146-089-515-936; 021-273-498-626-188; 024-033-843-222-077; 028-869-123-616-196; 031-147-233-409-28X; 033-890-182-096-159; 043-474-882-033-925; 045-511-501-160-748; 046-866-027-474-959; 052-748-425-792-522; 059-381-194-377-394; 060-882-294-240-724; 063-758-323-936-562; 064-833-710-039-929; 069-801-182-367-296; 071-436-711-830-67X; 072-364-610-711-467; 076-038-272-650-877; 082-223-460-670-164; 091-559-543-065-950; 095-423-592-783-302; 096-023-267-413-774; 108-423-824-994-134; 113-389-750-539-802; 123-805-887-151-529; 134-132-731-404-230; 144-033-601-395-38X; 145-628-223-693-935; 163-564-159-564-305; 166-417-920-722-342; 167-132-469-229-365; 171-570-255-261-495; 181-531-736-524-808; 195-188-654-114-875,3

Vidon; B. Réal,"The fate of the herbicide isoproturon [3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea] was investigated in soil from a grassed buffer strip. Compared to a cropped soil originating from the same experimental site (K d = 1.8 L kg -1 ), sorption of isoproturon was enhanced in the grassed soil and especially in the surface layer (0-2 cm) containing a high proportion of nondecomposed plant residues (K d = 5.0 L kg -1 ). Nonhumified organic fractions isolated from the surface soil layer and corresponding to above and below-ground plant residues derived from the grass exhibited high sorption coefficients K d and K oc compared to the rest of the soil. Reversibility of sorption was lower in the grassed soil than in the cropped soil and decreased rapidly with time. A rapid degradation of isoproturon was observed at different depths of the grassed soil whereas most of the herbicide remained nondegraded in the cultivated soil: half-lives were respectively 72 d in the cultivated soil, and only 8 d in the superficial layer (0-2 cm) of the grassed soil. The highest mineralization rate of the isoproturon ring (20% after 35 d) was observed in the top layer (0-2 cm) having the highest mineralization rates of organic matter. In relation with this fast degradation, a large proportion of isoproturon residues became nonavailable to water and methanol extractions (54% of the initial applied isoproturon found as nonextractable (bound) residues). Thus the grassed strip surface soil had a high potential to dissipate isoproturon trapped from run-off.",28,1,121,129,Environmental chemistry; Mineralization (soil science); Biodegradation; Soil science; Pesticide; Chemistry; Surface layer; Buffer strip; Organic matter; Sorption; Soil contamination,,,,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/1948933 https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/28/1/JEQ0280010121 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq1999.00472425002800010014x,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1999.00472425002800010014x,,10.2134/jeq1999.00472425002800010014x,2047810137,,0,,72

094-645-205-628-669,The impact of floral resources on syrphid performance and cabbage aphid biological control,,2006,,,,,,Paul C. J. van Rijn; Jurgen Kooijman; Felix L. Wäckers,"We investigated the impact of floral resources on syrphid fitness parameters and on biological control of cabbage aphids. The work led us to the following conclusions: Honeydew of cabbage aphids enhances the survival of the hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus, and can be an important food source when the syrphids are searching within the crop for oviposition sites. Syrphids can only reproduce when pollen is available as well. Feeding on pollen and nectar during the pre-ovipositional period allows the females to produce eggs for a week thereafter, even when flowers are no longer available. This shows that they can store their food reserves for several days. Female syrphids probably focuses on flower foraging during the first week after emergence, before switching to searching for aphids and oviposition sites (in the crop). Thereafter, the syrphid will have to travel again between floral patches and aphid patches to maintain egg maturation. Cage experiments show that the syrphid E. balteatus can be an effective predator of cabbage aphids on Brussels sprouts. The resurgence of the cabbage aphids in autumn, when natural enemies such as syrphids virtually disappear, suggests that these natural enemies play an important role in keeping the aphids under control during summer. Syrphids are stimulated in the crop by the vicinity of flowering plants like buckwheat and cornflower. During summer the differences in syrphid densities were not reflected in aphid population levels. Possibly, natural enemies that are less dependent on floral resources, such as parasitoids, compensate for the small scale differences in syrphid predator density.",,,,,Biological pest control; Nectar; Horticulture; Foraging; Aphid; Episyrphus balteatus; Honeydew; Hoverfly; Population; Biology,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Felix_Waeckers/publication/228480150_The_impact_of_floral_resources_on_syrphid_performance_and_cabbage_aphid_biological_control/links/00b7d523536bfa4774000000.pdf?disableCoverPage=true https://www.uva.nl/binaries/content/documents/personalpages/r/i/p.c.j.vanrijn/en/tab-four/tab-four/cpitem%5B8%5D/asset?1355373685569 https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/9198/,https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/9198/,,,125176218,,0,007-928-236-980-870; 012-466-311-051-172; 172-012-594-087-145; 194-595-863-937-394,25

Deasy; John Quinton; Martyn Silgram; Bob Jackson; Carly J. Stevens,"The Mitigation Options for Phosphorus and Sediment (MOPS) project investigated the effectiveness of within-field control measures (tramline management, straw residue management, type of cultivation and direction, and vegetative buffers) in terms of mitigating sediment and phosphorus loss from winter-sown combinable cereal crops using three case study sites. To determine the cost of the approaches, simple financial spreadsheet models were constructed at both farm and regional levels. Taking into account crop areas, crop rotation margins per hectare were calculated to reflect the costs of crop establishment, fertiliser and agro-chemical applications, harvesting, and the associated labour and machinery costs. Variable and operating costs associated with each mitigation option were then incorporated to demonstrate the impact on the relevant crop enterprise and crop rotation margins. These costs were then compared to runoff, sediment and phosphorus loss data obtained from monitoring hillslope-length scale field plots. Each of the mitigation options explored in this study had potential for reducing sediment and phosphorus losses from arable land under cereal crops. Sediment losses were reduced from between 9 kg ha−1 to as much as 4780 kg ha−1 with a corresponding reduction in phosphorus loss from 0.03 kg ha−1 to 2.89 kg ha−1. In percentage terms reductions of phosphorus were between 9% and 99%. Impacts on crop rotation margins also varied. Minimum tillage resulted in cost savings (up to £50 ha−1) whilst other options showed increased costs (up to £19 ha−1 for straw residue incorporation). Overall, the results indicate that each of the options has potential for on-farm implementation. However, tramline management appeared to have the greatest potential for reducing runoff, sediment, and phosphorus losses from arable land (between 69% and 99%) and is likely to be considered cost-effective with only a small additional cost of £2–4 ha−1, although further work is needed to evaluate alternative tramline management methods. Tramline management is also the only option not incorporated within current policy mechanisms associated with reducing soil erosion and phosphorus loss and in light of its potential is an approach that should be encouraged once further evidence is available.",30,1,234,242,Minimum tillage; Crop rotation; Hectare; Straw; Sediment; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Phosphorus; Arable land; Environmental engineering,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837712000610 https://core.ac.uk/display/42146651 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=4324775 http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/27914/ https://researcharchive.lincoln.ac.nz/handle/10182/8586 https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/53872/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.03.027,,10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.03.027,2063648080,,0,001-083-070-974-891; 002-289-806-087-524; 003-582-932-697-656; 004-424-923-330-070; 006-091-377-484-346; 011-953-794-268-094; 012-270-562-930-580; 015-136-520-607-410; 017-803-554-750-37X; 020-755-871-380-59X; 021-064-526-292-381; 023-833-493-505-921; 030-665-886-156-332; 032-966-313-575-494; 035-943-990-381-491; 038-154-911-202-449; 054-469-018-454-56X; 061-403-908-682-398; 068-553-625-306-77X; 068-843-316-009-830; 076-730-383-475-785; 076-779-230-104-235; 076-914-949-136-341; 080-581-329-922-191; 090-006-034-117-891; 093-710-676-627-680; 118-806-069-141-947; 121-765-856-530-837; 132-902-790-271-293; 134-261-193-693-91X; 134-423-481-321-861; 138-651-648-737-878; 142-231-073-413-920; 153-368-929-556-854; 160-543-263-675-951; 168-181-565-322-997; 168-222-853-197-586,20

Anderson; Clark J. Gantzer,"Planting stiff-stemmed grass hedges in a watershed may reduce water runoff and soil erosion, in part by altering soil macroporosity. The objective of this study was to characterize macroporosity of soils under a perennial grass hedge system for 12 yr using x-ray computed tomography (CT) and to compare CT-macroporosity results with macroporosity estimated from water retention data. Three positions were sampled: grass hedge position, deposition zone position 0.5 m upslope from grass hedges, and row crop position 7 m upslope from the hedges. Intact core samples (76 mm x 76 mm) were collected from two depths, 0 to 100 and 100 to 200 mm, with five replicates per position per depth. Number of pores (macro- and meso-), averaged across depths, in the grass hedge were nearly 2.5 times greater than those in the row crop and five times greater than in the deposition positions; however their circularity was 8.8% lower than in the row crop and 2.6% lower than in the deposition positions. The CT-measured macroporosity was significantly greater (P < 0.01) for the grass hedge position (0.056 m 3 m ""') as compared with the row crop (0.014 m 3 m - 3 ) and deposition positions (0.006 m 3 m - 3 ). The fractal dimension (D) was significantly greater (P < 0.01) for the grass hedge position (D = 1.56) than in the row crop (D = 1.31) and the deposition (D = 1.12) positions. The values of all measured pore characteristics decreased with depth. Computed tomography-measured macroporosity data were comparable with macroporosity estimated from water retention data. These findings suggest that grass hedge systems have created more pores and a greater volume of macroporosity.",69,5,1609,1616,Soil structure; Soil science; Soil water; Sowing; Row crop; Water retention; Panicum virgatum; Mathematics; Hydrology; Surface runoff; Soil management,,,,Missouri Agricultural Experiment Station,https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/sssaj/abstracts/69/5/1609 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005SSASJ..69.1609R/abstract https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005SSASJ..69.1609R/abstract https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj2004.0312,http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2004.0312,,10.2136/sssaj2004.0312,2058407316,,0,003-232-594-172-08X; 009-775-235-611-676; 022-449-873-473-500; 040-925-745-116-223; 046-263-815-919-688; 049-820-579-650-450; 053-709-407-254-936; 053-723-491-232-844; 056-367-934-468-09X; 057-746-733-301-935; 066-462-026-689-709; 075-203-546-587-538; 079-129-085-692-492; 080-135-073-671-789; 120-485-716-512-01X; 144-392-506-672-742; 147-694-651-965-413; 158-645-409-289-179; 161-311-872-202-272; 173-909-008-294-073; 177-701-701-452-239,93

Benoit; V. Pot; I. Madrigal; Laura Delgado-Moreno; C. Labat,"Summary; ; Displacement experiments of bromide and two herbicides, isoproturon and metribuzin, were performed in unsaturated undisturbed soil cores sampled on a unique site under (i) conventional wheat/maize rotation, (ii) 10-year-old grassed strip and (iii) 80-year-old oak/chestnut forest. Steady state conditions at constant rainfall intensity were used to compare the effect of the different land uses on soil herbicide transport and dissipation parameters. For each herbicide, mobility was similar between grassed strip and cultivated soils while it was reduced in the forest soils. The descriptive and moment analyses of the experimental breakthrough curves of bromide and herbicides demonstrated a similar degree of physical non-equilibrium transport for the cropped and grassland soil columns, with transport ranging from a less intense physical non-equilibrium status to the complete physical equilibrium state for the forest soil columns. Chemical non-equilibrium transport was shown for the three situations. Degradation occurred in some columns as demonstrated by the elution of a metabolite of isoproturon. Previous data on sorption and degradation of isoproturon on the same soils were used to explain the differences observed in the analysis of the elution curves between grassed strip, forest and cultivated soil. Averaging Kd values from individual soil layers of each profile gave a satisfying understanding of isoproturon retardation factors. Sorption on soil organic matter was the main factor in herbicide mobility. However, other phenomena such as degradation and formation of non-extractable residues were involved in the differences observed in leached masses of isoproturon between the three situations.",58,1,320,328,Loam; Soil horizon; Soil science; Soil water; Soil type; Soil organic matter; Grassland; Metribuzin; Environmental science; Sorption,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2006.00844.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2006.00844.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2389.2006.00844.x,2122990475,,0,002-650-706-842-54X; 004-871-635-237-765; 005-046-617-641-306; 009-625-949-046-011; 009-742-460-635-737; 014-007-996-828-713; 017-014-349-136-029; 041-722-359-883-455; 042-230-387-909-769; 045-533-861-821-797; 057-703-038-933-033; 060-111-825-032-663; 061-629-643-907-708; 065-427-966-967-115; 072-074-944-637-783; 077-555-472-027-256; 082-425-030-497-387; 083-971-752-530-892; 086-496-072-727-834; 093-545-226-420-459; 094-049-137-663-313; 103-286-115-762-912; 104-068-479-803-683; 118-430-657-299-334; 119-498-654-148-917; 133-363-147-232-814; 155-410-897-891-613; 175-950-958-362-911,25

However, in north Iberia, a red squirrel population resides in hedgerows separating meadows. This study assesses seasonal microhabitat selection in this peculiar squirrel population. The detection rate was higher in winter and autumn than in spring and summer because of the confluence of different biological and environmental factors. Red squirrels were mainly arboreal, though they used the ground to some degree throughout the year. The height at which individuals were seen in shrubs/trees was maximum in spring related to intensive use of high poplars. A seasonal variation in plant selection was found. Red squirrels selected oaks, ivy and poplars positively in winter, poplars, ashes and willows in spring, hazels, wild cherries and willows in summer, and hazels, ashes and willows in autumn, linked with shelter, nest-site and food requirements. Conservation of dense hedgerow networks with a high diversity of shrub and tree species is encouraged.

Feber,"Summary; ; ; 1; Farmland is readily divisible into linear habitats such as hedges, and non-linear habitats such as fields and woodlots. In agricultural landscapes, conservationists have generally focused on enhancing linear habitats, but there are few data from which to judge whether or not this is a good strategy for biodiversity.; ; 2; We investigated whether the linear or non-linear character of habitat patches, mediated by edge effects, has an impact on the abundance, diversity and richness of the small mammal communities that live within and between them.; ; 3; In particular, we hypothesized, first, that edge effects cause narrow linear habitats to be avoided by specialists such as the bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus, but not by generalists such as the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus; secondly, that edge effects lead to specialists being present in atypical habitat, through excursions at the interface between two habitats.; ; 4; We tested these hypotheses by live-trapping small mammals in grids in the centres of three non-linear farmland habitats (woodlots, set-aside and crop fields) and in field boundaries consisting of a series of adjoining linear habitats. We compared mammal communities in the non-linear habitats with the field boundary as a whole, and with the individual linear habitat elements within the boundary.; ; 5; There was no evidence that specialists avoided linear habitats. Indeed, the field boundary was the most species-rich habitat surveyed, and bank voles were more abundant in linear hedgerow than in non-linear woodland. Bank voles were present in linear set-aside and in the crop edge, but never in non-linear blocks of set-aside or crop, implying that they diffused out of the hedgerow into the adjacent habitats. There was no evidence of an effect of habitat linearity on field voles Microtus agrestis, wood mice or common shrews Sorex araneus.; ; 6; Our results suggest that on uncropped land such as set-aside, the linear or non-linear character of habitats will make little difference to small mammal abundance and diversity.

The main objectives were: (1) to assess the value of field margins for conserving avian diversity in agricultural landscapes, (2) to document their potential as breeding habitats for bird species particularly those considered as nuisance for crops, and (3) to describe habitat variables that best explained bird use of field margins. Three types of field margins were distinguished: (a) natural hedgerows (n=27) with well developed tree and shrub strata, (b) planted windbreaks (n=17) mostly composed of coniferous trees and generally devoid of a well structured shrub stratum, and (c) herbaceous field margins (n=17) with isolated shrubs. A total of 42 bird species were recorded. Bird use of hedgerows and windbreaks was similar, herbaceous field margins having fewer bird species and individuals than the other two types of field margin. Field margins did not contribute significantly as breeding habitats of bird species that may damage crops, but offered shelter to a broad range of species potentially useful for biological pest control. Bird use of field margins was mostly related to hedges’ structural complexity and dimension. Conserving natural hedgerows, minimising mechanical and chemical control of the vegetation in field margins, and planting a mix of deciduous and coniferous species in windbreaks represent efficient conservation strategies both from a wildlife and an agronomic point of view.",84,2,131,143,Biodiversity; Windbreak; Vegetation; Habitat; Ecology; Range (biology); Geography; Shrub; Wildlife; Deciduous; Agroforestry,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880900002061,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-8809(00)00206-1,,10.1016/s0167-8809(00)00206-1,1980647357,,0,002-234-862-186-238; 003-054-551-205-858; 004-724-454-913-63X; 007-361-282-044-640; 010-333-012-350-322; 015-863-314-524-72X; 018-330-416-455-013; 021-915-996-987-21X; 023-310-699-181-261; 032-245-730-539-873; 033-191-662-284-359; 036-410-870-336-367; 050-627-594-935-711; 051-197-969-663-775; 055-083-398-263-398; 060-884-804-074-471; 062-018-456-407-701; 066-259-869-255-462; 067-391-632-571-699; 072-224-176-896-782; 074-197-517-203-385; 075-323-170-284-198; 091-415-969-356-605; 091-707-812-404-482; 096-158-054-416-806; 097-681-694-700-322; 110-766-047-364-379; 113-900-387-576-996; 114-788-294-317-652; 121-834-797-768-154; 123-256-231-649-245; 143-679-302-437-400; 152-908-202-983-300; 159-006-799-411-189; 163-972-676-901-659; 178-521-789-606-615; 188-681-329-949-137,75

Some wildflower strips are mown or harrowed to maintain species diversity. Management and associated changes in vegetation structure may affect seed predation which is a key factor in plant population dynamics. The aims of the present work were to (1) assess the magnitude and spatial variation of seed predation in managed wildflower strips, (2) identify the responsible seed predators, and (3) investigate differences between seed species. The study was conducted in five wildflower strips in northern Switzerland; the treatments were fallow, mowing and harrowing in winter. Permanent plots were established to investigate the vegetation structure, seed removal from selectively accessible dishes, and rodent abundance in life traps. Seeds of three arable weeds were offered which are used in wildflower seed mixtures ( Agrostemma githago , Camelina sativa , Centaurea cyanus ). Seeds of Prunus avium were chosen to investigate exclusively predation by rodents. Losses of seed were recorded for one week in four experiments from June to August. Management had only a moderate effect on the structure of the vegetation in summer. Fallow and mown plots were similar and had a tall and dense canopy, whereas plant cover was sparse in the harrowed plots. A total of 101 plant species occurred, although most plots were dominated by Tanacetum vulgare and Elymus repens . In the harrowed plots annual species were more abundant (e.g., C. cyanus , Chamomilla recutita , Papaver rhoeas ). The selectively accessible dishes revealed that rodents and slugs were the main seed predators. Predation by insects and passerine birds was negligible. Rodents strongly preferred C. cyanus , whereas slugs destroyed most seed of C. sativa . After one week seed losses amounted to 43–51% in C. sativa , 23–25% C. cyanus and 10–12% A. githago . The rank order of the species was similar for the three management treatments and both study periods. Predation of C. sativa was significantly reduced in the harrowed plots, whereas the losses of C. cyanus were independent of management. Live-trapping suggested that Apodemus flavicollis and A. sylvaticus were mainly responsible for seed predation of C. cyanus ; Microtus arvalis avoided harrowed plots. It is concluded that only harrowing significantly affects the vegetation structure of wildflower strips and reduces seed losses, that seed predation by rodents and slugs is high, and that arable weeds are affected to a different extent.",83,3,285,296,Predation; Plant cover; Cyanus; Weed; Wildflower; Seed predation; Elymus repens; Centaurea cyanus; Botany; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880900002024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-8809(00)00202-4,,10.1016/s0167-8809(00)00202-4,2022783191,,0,004-010-787-386-28X; 004-237-567-877-147; 005-833-582-864-691; 007-635-301-988-969; 010-009-952-174-424; 010-945-646-716-071; 013-801-483-768-42X; 014-341-100-117-630; 015-479-304-278-098; 016-573-648-664-125; 017-301-798-471-019; 020-394-955-680-687; 020-974-401-450-004; 021-026-931-239-376; 024-483-150-779-700; 024-756-699-374-795; 026-937-906-032-356; 027-974-001-277-77X; 030-145-510-063-139; 030-207-952-990-125; 030-711-173-650-933; 031-905-111-001-075; 033-688-788-578-102; 033-718-547-875-987; 038-684-585-588-865; 039-936-551-657-61X; 041-686-795-355-194; 043-500-631-668-754; 045-978-368-270-313; 048-529-956-384-881; 049-088-413-362-630; 050-559-473-120-629; 052-865-416-956-188; 053-551-700-281-485; 057-655-484-758-059; 058-207-004-241-606; 060-813-541-948-641; 063-936-679-622-512; 066-897-512-647-945; 067-996-338-341-210; 072-075-320-524-259; 072-817-046-222-302; 075-746-480-320-013; 076-016-447-384-973; 080-490-412-008-807; 086-419-085-554-996; 087-185-351-771-625; 087-988-213-080-905; 091-459-193-083-754; 098-116-028-219-152; 106-788-971-884-663; 107-018-658-803-543; 107-745-401-264-178; 108-735-662-799-143; 108-827-991-488-483; 114-480-653-531-829; 117-669-932-807-814; 125-995-631-935-63X; 140-037-889-581-116; 140-815-034-308-497; 142-638-428-622-145; 144-405-102-331-626; 156-060-321-738-674; 165-804-108-473-473; 170-044-763-432-805; 174-054-328-942-709; 175-327-710-689-529; 186-370-719-055-445; 198-423-264-986-893,42

As a result, most headwater streams show structurally degraded channels, lacking riparian buffer zones, which are heavily loaded with nutrients from the surrounding crop fields. The present study examines whether longitudinally restricted riparian forest buffers can enhance the in-stream nutrient retention in nutrient-enriched headwater streams. We estimated nutrient uptake from pairwise, shortterm addition experiments with 15NH4, NH4, PO4, and NaCl within reaches with riparian forest buffers (RFB) and degraded reaches (DEG) of the same streams. Riparian forest buffers originated from the conservation of the pristine vegetation or from restoration measures. Hydrologic retention was calculated with the model OTIS-P on the basis of conductivity breakthrough curves from the salt injections. A significant increase in surface transient storage was revealed in pristine and restored RFB reaches compared with DEG reaches due to the longitudinal steppool pattern and the frequent occurrence of woody debris on the channel bed. Ammonium uptake lengths were significantly shorter in RFB reaches than in DEG reaches, resulting from the higher hydrologic retention. Uptake velocities did not differ significantly between RFB and DEG reaches, indicating that riparian forest buffers did not affect the biochemical nutrient demand. Uptake of 15NH4 was mainly driven by autotrophs. Net PO4 uptake was not affected by riparian forest buffers. The study shows that the physical and biogeochemical effects of riparian forest buffers on the in-stream nutrient retention are limited in the case of highly eutrophic streams.",41,2,373,379,Riparian zone; Nutrient; Riparian forest; Vegetation; Eutrophication; Riparian buffer; Hydrology; Environmental science; STREAMS; Biogeochemical cycle,,Agriculture/methods; Conservation of Natural Resources/methods; Fertilizers/analysis; Rivers/chemistry; Time Factors; Trees,Fertilizers,European Regional Development Fund; European-Territorial-Cooperation Austria-Czech Republic; Government of Lower Austria; Austrian Ministry of Environment,https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2134/jeq2010.0436 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22370399 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2134/jeq2010.0436 https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/pdfs/41/2/373 https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:321107 http://core.ac.uk/display/19490302,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2010.0436,22370399,10.2134/jeq2010.0436,2066115770,,0,001-785-297-014-015; 003-006-911-336-442; 005-367-762-394-433; 014-523-213-915-564; 015-031-207-682-544; 015-290-312-918-180; 016-097-351-692-542; 020-821-795-318-083; 021-295-006-788-082; 028-843-468-950-477; 029-491-286-007-883; 031-938-120-755-857; 032-329-555-105-303; 035-423-766-959-157; 055-190-617-488-049; 056-016-522-406-162; 073-430-824-144-233; 077-873-845-369-202; 104-310-637-590-138; 110-195-458-330-169; 111-765-441-561-743; 112-120-608-546-683; 128-897-191-630-604; 131-445-608-802-012; 144-647-630-481-945; 146-606-352-041-123; 168-228-690-607-508; 169-607-559-923-667; 184-635-815-001-277; 186-231-509-533-744; 193-242-118-369-606,34

Zhang; James R. Brandle; G. E. Meyer; Laurie Hodges,"The effectiveness of windbreaks in windspeed reduction is often evaluated without regard to the objects to be protected. In fact, many objects may have different sensitivities to wind and often require different degrees of wind protection. Since commonly used indexes do not consider the sensitivity to wind, a concept of specific protection efficiency is developed. A critical windspeed is used to represent the sensitivity of each object. Windspeeds greater than this value are considered damaging. A dimensionless protection index is defined to evaluate windbreak efficiency. The maximum index value is 1 for the highest protection, and the index is negative when sheltered windspeed is greater than the critical windspeed. This index can be compared, summed, and averaged across different windbreaks, objects, and leeward locations. A sample of critical windspeed values was compiled from the literature. The index was evaluated using actual wind data measured under both sheltered and open conditions. The results indicated that the index can be used for evaluating windbreak effectiveness in terms of objects protected under various conditions. This model could be used as a tool for windbreak-related research and policy making.",29,3,191,200,Windbreak; Meteorology; Wind speed; Ecology; Sensitivity (control systems); Index (economics); Policy making; Environmental science,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00704868 https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/natrespapers/1126/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00704868,,10.1007/bf00704868,2088740959,,0,008-500-979-536-278; 015-863-314-524-72X; 020-676-467-924-684; 027-927-178-104-514; 038-766-077-028-908; 056-364-770-339-879; 065-624-820-033-072; 065-928-186-244-683; 067-258-563-917-066; 067-990-898-307-195; 107-863-895-899-436; 108-737-877-432-356; 109-589-023-105-532; 114-765-340-699-400; 125-258-600-057-686; 125-552-920-652-051; 130-648-699-134-745; 175-051-667-696-656; 187-378-847-213-834; 189-991-561-415-762,17

A total of 376 observations of grey partridges and 211 of red‐legged partridges were collected during two years of study (1984 and 1985). Habitat overlap and breadth were similar in the two species; both species avoided woods and chose hedgerows in spring and summer but in autumn‐winter selection of permanent cover differed: grey partridges selecting hedgerows and red‐legged partridges calanques and landslides, the driest habitats in the study area. Significant differences were also found for nesting site selection: grey partridges preferred the edges of habitats and hedgerows, while red‐legged partridges selected the centre of habitats, vineyards and uncultivated land. In general, grey partridges seemed to be more linked to crops and open land than did red‐legged partridges and this latter species needs a similar habitat in cover structure and micro‐climate to those of its zones of origin.

In field cage tests when a 3, 4.5, or 6 m strip of barren soil separated a source of mite-infestation from initially mite-free peanut, mite damage to peanut was inversely related to the distance of barren soil crossed. In uncaged field tests, similar barren soil borders did not prevent mite movement into peanut fields, however, the number of mites were inversely related to the distance from the field border. There were no significant differences among weed border treatments and total numbers of mites entering peanut fields over time. There were, however, differences among weed border treatments on early mite movement and establishment trends into peanut fields. Mowing weed borders significantly increased the number of aerially dispersing twospotted spider mites within the adjacent peanut field.",11,1,52,55,Weed; Tetranychus urticae; Spider mite; Mite; Spider; Arachis hypogaea; Biological dispersal; Cultural control; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://meridian.allenpress.com/peanut-science/article/11/1/52/107784/Effect-of-Barren-Soil-Borders-and-Weed-Border,http://dx.doi.org/10.3146/i0095-3679-11-1-16,,10.3146/i0095-3679-11-1-16,2052724269,,0,047-035-936-110-801; 140-360-674-072-71X; 175-965-203-315-262,4

Traps were located in the crop centre and within four field margins from each field and serviced for three weeks in June/July in 2004. Trap locations were classified according to local habitat, crop, flower numbers and distances to other features, including woodland and water. Multivariate and regression analyses indicated that hoverfly numbers and species richness were significantly enhanced by proximity to winter oilseed rape crops, which maintained a significant weed flora below the crop canopy, compared with cereals. Catches were reduced close to set-aside and linseed, but margin type and flower numbers did not often contribute to models. Proximity to woodland was important for Ferdinandea cuprea and Episyrphus balteatus. Traps on the west side of fields, had lower catches than traps located elsewhere. Hoverflies appeared to be responding to factors at the field-scale, reflecting crop management and weed control, as well as non-crop habitat in the landscape.",,,,,Crop; Woodland; Geography; Weed; Episyrphus balteatus; Hoverfly; Ferdinandea cuprea; Species richness; Agronomy; Arable land,,,,,http://www.agroecol.co.uk/Assets/Pages%20from%20Pages_91-100.pdf,http://www.agroecol.co.uk/Assets/Pages%20from%20Pages_91-100.pdf,,,2186024004,,0,000-999-762-967-231; 017-786-901-727-296,5

The need for mitigation measures was investigated at 10 stream sites within an intensively used arable region in central Germany by characterizing pesticide exposure following edge-of-field runoff and effects on the aquatic macroinvertebrates. Moreover, the influence of riparian buffer strip width (as a mitigation measure) at the sampling sites was considered. Generally, invertebrate fauna was dominated by pesticide-tolerant species, suggesting a high pesticide exposure at almost all sites. This result is also reflected by the elevated levels of suspended particle contamination in terms of toxic units (logTUMax > −2), corresponding to one-hundredth of the median lethal concentration (LC50) to Daphnia magna. At two sites that received high aqueous-phase entries of the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin (logTUMax > −0.6), the abundance and number of sensitive species in terms of the species at risk index decreased during the pesticide application period. In contrast, no acute significant negative effects on macroinvertebrates were observed at sites characterised by low water-phase toxicity (logTUMax < –3.5). An influence of riparian buffer strip width on pesticide exposure was not observed, supposedly because of the presence of erosion rills and ephemeral ditches. In conclusion, results show that mitigation measures (such as the improvement of currently present riparian buffer strips) are needed in the study area.

Webber; Steven K. Mickelson; Syed I. Ahmed; James R. Russell; Wendy Powers; Richard C. Schultz; John L. Kovar,"Livestock grazing in the Midwestern United States can result in significant levels of runoff sediment and nutrient losses to surface water resources. Some of these contaminants can increase stream eutrophication and are suspected of contributing to hypoxic conditions in the Gulf of Mexico. This research quantified effects of livestock grazing management practices and vegetative filter strip buffers on runoff depth and mass losses of total solids, nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), and ortho-phosphorus (PO4-P) under natural hydrologic conditions. Runoff data were collected from 12 rainfall events during 2001 to 2003 at an Iowa State University research farm in central Iowa, United States. Three vegetative buffers (paddock area:vegetative buffer area ratios of 1:0.2, 1:0.1, and 1:0 no buffer [control]) and three grazing management practices (continuous, rotational, and no grazing [control]) comprised nine treatment combinations (vegetative buffer ratio/grazing management practice) replicated in three 1.35 ha (3.34 ac) plot areas. The total 4.05 ha (10.02 ac) study area also included nine 0.4 ha (1.0 ac) paddocks and 27 vegetative buffer runoff collection units distributed in a randomized complete block design. The study site was established on uneven terrain with a maximum of 15% slopes and consisted of approximately 100% cool-season smooth bromegrass. Average paddock and vegetative buffer plant tiller densities estimated during the 2003 project season were approximately 62 million and 93 million tillers ha−1 (153 million and 230 million tillers ac−1), respectively. Runoff sample collection pipe leakage discovered and corrected during 2001 possibly reduced runoff depth and affected runoff contaminant mass losses data values. Consequently, 2001 runoff analysis results were limited to treatment comparisons within the 2001 season and were not compared with 2002 and 2003 data. Analysis results from 2001 showed no significant differences in average losses of runoff, total solids, NO3-N, and PO4-P among the nine vegetative buffer/grazing practice treatment combinations. Results from 2002 indicated significantly higher losses of runoff and total solids from 1:0 no buffer/rotational grazing and 1:0 no buffer/continuous grazing treatment combination plots, respectively, compared among other 2002 season treatment combinations. The 2003 results showed significantly higher runoff and total solids losses from 1:0 no buffer/no grazing treatment combination plots compared among all 2003 treatment combinations and from 1:0.1 vegetative buffer/no grazing treatment combination plots compared among all 2003 treatment combinations and with respective 2002 treatment combinations. However, the 2003 results indicated effective vegetative buffer performance with significantly lower runoff, total solids, and NO3-N losses from the larger 1:0.2 buffer area compared among the smaller 1:0.1 buffer area and 1:0 no buffer treatment combinations. The 2003 results also indicated a highly significant increase in losses of NO3-N from 1:0.1 buffer/no grazing treatment combination plots compared among other 2003 season treatment combinations and with respective 2002 treatment combinations. Overall results from this study suggest a shift from significantly higher 2002 season plot losses of continuous and rotational grazing treatment combinations to significantly higher 2003 season losses of no grazing treatment combinations. We speculate this shift to significantly higher runoff and contaminant losses from no grazing treatment combination plots during 2003 reflects the variability inherent to a complex and dynamic soil-water environment of livestock grazing areas. However, we also hypothesize the environmental conditions that largely consisted of a dense perennial cool-season grass type, high-relief landscape, and relatively high total rainfall depth may not necessarily include livestock grazing activities.",65,1,34,41,Total dissolved solids; Eutrophication; Nitrate; Grazing; Water quality; Filter strip; Sample collection; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Agronomy,,,,,https://www.jswconline.org/content/65/1/34.abstract https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/abe_eng_pubs/230/ https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103067367.html https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103067367 https://www.jswconline.org/content/65/1/34.refs https://core.ac.uk/display/38933455 https://works.bepress.com/steven_mickelson/33/download/ http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1231&context=abe_eng_pubs https://core.ac.uk/download/38933455.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.65.1.34,,10.2489/jswc.65.1.34,2134753167,,0,003-148-094-786-550; 005-046-617-641-306; 010-433-383-886-36X; 011-227-693-282-050; 011-404-320-444-461; 019-036-305-723-619; 020-306-705-734-82X; 038-335-400-539-341; 038-439-180-047-201; 039-481-527-740-116; 040-198-568-662-726; 054-030-546-702-933; 054-142-450-794-649; 056-409-667-021-818; 057-131-240-501-938; 059-949-847-321-259; 062-459-234-621-52X; 066-513-898-486-631; 076-121-466-874-85X; 076-826-572-086-275; 079-196-971-304-319; 083-268-336-005-496; 087-135-266-264-121; 092-001-477-844-772; 092-243-016-623-346; 097-732-496-513-136; 100-572-395-204-584; 101-181-727-684-317; 101-813-796-974-45X; 104-494-518-145-022; 106-928-102-289-020; 107-002-386-586-197; 107-914-292-939-854; 115-642-860-718-878; 115-650-258-430-45X; 122-164-061-427-118; 128-195-997-346-382; 139-686-152-452-357; 142-912-781-466-437; 143-525-749-162-800; 165-740-369-689-328; 169-607-559-923-667; 179-039-702-328-618; 181-000-667-326-695,30

Methods Territory distribution, nesting success and foraging behaviour of adults feeding chicks at the nest were recorded and related to habitat composition on two Scottish lowland farms.

Nests were predominantly located in conifer trees and hedgerows. Trees were selected preferentially for foraging.

The within-field distribution of adult E. terebrans was sampled in 1991 and 1992 by placing malaise traps near a wooded edge, near an herbaceous edge, and in the field interior in each of 4 fields of corn, Zea mays L. During the 1st generation of 1991, significantly more females were captured in wooded-edge traps than in herbaceous-edge or interior traps. In the 1st generation of 1992, more females were again captured in wooded-edge traps in 2 fields, whereas in the other 2 fields, more were captured in both herbaceous-edge and wooded-edge traps than interior traps. In the 2nd generation of both years, there was no consistent pattern of distribution of adult females among sites. The distribution pattern of adult females among fields was not consistently correlated with the distribution of O. nubilalis larvae or percentage parasitism. Overall, fewer males were captured than females, and in the 1st generation of both years, more males were captured near wooded edges of cornfields in which the previous crop had been corn, than any other sites. Both male and female E. terebrans were captured in malaise traps at the interface of a woodlot canopy and a cornfield with capture zones from 1 to 4.3 m high. We propose that E. terebrans distribution in cornfields is influenced by resources such as sugar and a moderate microclimate present in adjacent woodlots but unavailable in early-season cornfields.

We used 10-minute distance point counts to estimate density, occupancy, colonization, and extinction rates of male bobwhite around 154 agriculture fields, half of which had a fallow field border. We estimated percent of cropland, forest, pasture, early successional, and urban cover within 1- km radius buffers (314ha) surrounding all point count locations. We examined the influence of 6 predictor variables (landscape composition metrics and field border presence) on bobwhite density and occupancy dynamics. Bobwhite density increased with the presence of field borders. Conversely, bobwhite density decreased as the percentage of urban, pasture, and forest lands increased. The presence of a field border did not influence occupancy, colonization, or extinction rates. However, as the percentage of cropland increased within the landscape, bobwhite occupancy increased and as the percentage of pasture increased, bobwhite colonization decreased. As the percentage of forest and urban increased and cropland decreased, bobwhite extinction rate increased. Our results indicated that local establishment of field borders does not increase bobwhite occupancy rates, but field borders can increase densities in suitable landscapes where bobwhite are present. Habitat restoration for bobwhite will most effectively increase population densities if focused in landscapes dominated by suitable cover types, where bobwhite occurrence is high. 2013 The Wildlife Society.",78,1,93,100,Occupancy; Habitat; Ecology; Population density; Geography; Pasture; Wildlife; Urbanization; Habitat destruction; Restoration ecology,,,,"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; Multistate Conservation Grant Program MS M-2-R; Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program; Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies; Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology Program",https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jwmg.639 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jwmg.639/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.639,,10.1002/jwmg.639,2129787957,,0,003-514-811-453-642; 004-878-518-476-689; 005-013-299-612-786; 005-068-000-072-681; 008-528-640-582-739; 009-262-034-010-715; 018-128-541-350-350; 023-683-277-287-21X; 024-233-811-621-512; 026-503-686-110-018; 032-521-194-666-198; 032-563-160-588-721; 034-308-643-508-970; 034-350-057-263-068; 034-456-136-124-424; 040-618-665-169-421; 043-388-671-984-332; 044-114-542-356-91X; 049-116-206-901-318; 051-968-065-430-322; 063-078-669-045-864; 066-775-029-249-36X; 068-567-084-277-634; 072-168-292-167-022; 072-270-823-716-141; 072-745-845-642-67X; 073-352-367-110-132; 074-241-310-816-85X; 084-426-480-835-483; 109-359-974-878-596; 109-857-896-745-756; 109-963-986-230-480; 115-521-700-055-314; 122-171-329-916-226; 139-914-557-884-686; 141-760-573-202-465; 158-108-874-474-851; 166-152-846-701-103; 166-806-633-528-132; 179-513-204-819-129; 193-598-530-261-354,8

099-545-086-180-93X,Do sown wildflower strips enhance the parasitism of lepidopteran pests in cabbage crops,,2003,,,,,,Lukas Pfiffner; L. Merkelbach; Henryk Luka,"We have investigated the parasitism rates of cabbage lepidopteran pest in relation to presence or absence of adjacent sown, species rich wildflower strips at two sites on farms in the region Grosses Moos, Switzerland. Three treatments have been tested: (1) cabbage adjacent to a wildflower strip, (2) cabbage near to a wildflower strip (>10 m up to 90 m), and (3 = control) cabbage without wildflower strip or any other semi-natural habitats nearby. Caterpillars and eggs of Mamestra brassicae, Pieris rapae, and Plutella xylostella (only larvae) have been sampled weekly in the unsprayed cabbage crops at 6 dates (cauliflower) and 9 dates (red cabbage). The parasitism rate of each pest species and its stage of development was recorded. Caterpillars of M. brassicae and P. rapae were parasitised at a higher rate in cabbage fields near to the wildflower strip. In contrast, caterpillars of P. xylostella were significantly more parasitised in the field without strip. The parasitism rate of eggs was relatively low in general (14-35%), but increased in the proximity of the strips. In addition, the diversity and abundance of parasitic wasp families (Hymenoptera parasitica) recorded by sweep net catches were much higher in wildflower strips (up to 3 fold more specimens than in cauliflower; 14-16 families) than in the cabbage crops (7-11 families). In conclusion, data of this on-farm trial indicate that wildflower strips enhance the diversity and abundance of parasitic wasps, and thus may improve parasitism of certain lepidopteran cabbage pests in adjacent fields.",,,,,Horticulture; Larva; PEST analysis; Wildflower; Plutella; Pieris rapae; Parasitism; Hymenoptera; Red cabbage; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://www.biogeography.unibas.ch/Publikationen/papers/pfiffner_%20merkelbach_luka_2003.pdf https://orgprints.org/id/eprint/947/ https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lukas_Pfiffner/publication/237290402_Do_sown_wildflower_strips_enhance_the_parasitism_of_lepidopteran_pests_in_cabbage_crops/links/00b495304963079674000000.pdf,https://www.biogeography.unibas.ch/Publikationen/papers/pfiffner_%20merkelbach_luka_2003.pdf,,,2112482455,,0,010-945-646-716-071; 015-648-440-419-195; 026-735-761-517-671; 041-768-237-199-317; 044-315-002-495-725; 056-345-625-364-775; 056-892-630-404-500; 060-884-804-074-471; 095-787-505-942-81X; 115-011-427-041-375; 122-528-143-728-138; 126-567-876-134-094; 138-874-200-436-40X; 185-762-846-999-381,19

Koska maan rakenne vaikuttaa keskeisesti suojavyohykkeiden ja -kaistojen toimintaan, tassa tutkimuksessa tarkasteltiin suojakaistojen hoitotoimenpiteista aiheutuvia mahdollisia muutoksia maan fysikaalisiin (irtotiheys ja ilmanjohtavuus) ominaisuuksiin ja maan kokoonpuristumisominaisuuksiin. Tutkittuja hoitotoimenpiteita olivat niitto ja niittojatteen poiskorjaaminen, laidunnus seka alueen jattaminen luonnontilaan.Jokioisilla savimaan (Vertic Cambisol) ja Maaningalla hietamaan (Haplic Regosol) koekenttien maaprofiili tutkittiin 200 cm:n (savi) ja 180 cm:n (hieta) syvyyteen saakka, ja maanaytteet otettiin kustakin horisontista. Etenkin hietamaalla oli muokkauskerroksen alapuolella kyntoantura yha havaittavissa 10 vuotta viljelyn lopettamisen ja suojakaistan perustamisen jalkeen. Savimaan syvemmissa, todennakoisesti markina lapi vuoden sailyvissa horisonteissa (90-200 cm) maan irtotiheys oli pieni ( 0,52 cm3 cm-3), vaikka orgaanisen hiilen pitoisuus (< 0,9 %) oli erittain alhainen. Maan rakenne on yha massiivinen ja hyvin heikosti kehittynyt. Suojakaistojen pintamaakerroksesta (0-3 cm) ja maaprofiilien horisonteista otetut hairiintymattomat lierionaytteet (240 cm3) kyllastettiin ja tasapainotettiin hiekkapedilla (-6 kPa). Maan ilmanjohtavuus mitattiin ja naytteita kuormitettiin 7 tunnin ajan pystysuoralla normaalivoimalla (20, 40, 70, 100, 200 ja 400 kPa), minka jalkeen kuormitus vapautettiin (1 tunti). Jannitystilan ja vastaavan muodonmuutostilan valista riippuvuutta eli maan kokoonpuristumisominaisuuksia tarkasteltiin puolilogaritmisella asteikolla toisen asteen polynomin mukaisesti sovitetun jannitys-puristumakuvaajan avulla. Maan sisaista lujuutta eli kykya vastustaa ulkoapain tulevia voimia arvioitiin ns. esitiivistysasteen avulla, joka johdettiin graafisesti ns. Casagranden menetelmalla. Maaprofiilin eri horisonttien kokoonpuristuminen oli riippuvainen maalajista, ei niinkaan hoitotoimenpiteista, ja se oli huomattavasti suurempaa savimaalla kuin hietamaalla. Molemmilla maalajeilla kokoonpuristuminen vaheni siirryttaessa pintamaasta pohjamaahan. Tama voi osaltaan selittya silla, etta veden poistuminen huokosista oli estynyt, mika esti kokoonpuristumisen. Suojakaistojen hoitotoimenpiteista laidunnus aiheutti epasuotuisia muodonmuutoksia savimaan rakenteessa, mika heijastui kaistojen heikentyneena ilmanjohtavuutena (2,7-5,1 10-5 m s-1) luonnontilaisiin kaistoihin verrattuna (15-22 10-5 m s-1). Kauttaaltaan alhaiset esitiivistysasteet voivat osin selittya varhaisella naytteenottoajankohdalla, jolloin maan rakenne on talven jaljilta heikoin mahdollinen. Laiduntaminen vaikutti kuitenkin maan kokoonpuristumisominaisuuksiin. Vaikka nuoren laidunkaistan tiivistyminen oli jo tiiviimmasta alkutilanteesta johtuen vahaista, myos puristuman kimmoinen palautuminen oli kuormituksen lakattua pienta. Vanha laidunkaista oli taas helposti tiivistyva, mutta maan pintakerrokseen keraantynyt orgaaninen aines lisasi kuormituksesta aiheutuneen puristuman palautumista. Tulosten perusteella laidunnusta tulisikin valttaa etenkin hiljattain perustetulla nurmella.",19,2,160,172,Physics; Animal science; Soil science; Management practices,,,,,https://jukuri.luke.fi/handle/10024/476756 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20113005719 http://www.mtt.fi/afs/pdf/mtt-afs-v19n2p160.pdf https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20113005719.html https://orgprints.org/id/eprint/17183/ https://core.ac.uk/display/88175102 https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/publications/compressive-behaviour-of-the-soil-in-buffer-zones-under-different http://ojs.tsv.fi/index.php/AFS/article/download/5983/5180 https://jukuri.luke.fi/bitstream/10024/476756/1/mtt-afs-v19n2p160.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2137/145960610791542370,,10.2137/145960610791542370,2169300722,,0,001-474-772-508-48X; 003-113-374-533-355; 003-505-107-799-004; 010-499-008-581-398; 012-418-024-310-761; 018-668-638-487-019; 019-017-087-015-45X; 031-910-633-584-155; 039-830-053-959-468; 042-957-723-836-739; 049-546-917-752-451; 050-704-155-271-999; 060-539-073-845-107; 066-008-497-105-394; 066-172-978-622-434; 068-978-940-046-537; 070-790-840-870-745; 079-323-048-915-879; 084-189-596-054-340; 084-384-701-399-61X; 095-619-675-811-019; 096-544-683-245-531; 096-667-889-444-595; 102-085-103-343-879; 107-868-292-934-063; 111-584-131-127-56X; 121-966-825-893-775; 126-766-414-526-239; 128-911-631-195-30X; 137-978-528-420-196; 138-870-157-756-513; 148-034-375-697-039; 152-142-141-323-66X; 155-077-672-111-552; 187-118-162-708-884,13

Functioning of a BZ depends on soil structure, as it is important for water infiltration. Therefore, it is vital to understand how varying management practices affect soils of BZs. We studied the structural and hydraulic properties of three differently managed BZs established in a boreal Vertic Stagnic Cambisol (clay, 51%). The three management practices for vegetation were as follows: natural with no treatment, harvested yearly and grazed by cattle. We used bulk density and macroporosity, together with a pore geometry index (air permeability per unit air-filled porosity), to describe the soil structural properties. Hydraulic properties were measured at different length scales by means of an aggregate sorptivity test, saturated hydraulic conductivity of the core samples and field-saturated hydraulic conductivity. Vegetation management markedly affected the physical properties in the top 5 cm of the soil. Properties were least favourable for infiltration at the grazed site, with the greatest bulk density, least macroporosity and hydraulic conductivity or greatest pore tortuosity. In general, spatial variation in zones with restricted and good hydraulic conductivity together with reduced aggregate sorptivity in the deeper horizons made the soil prone to preferential flow when initially dry. Prolonged wetness, on the other hand, reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity significantly, resulting in surface run-off. Harvesting was considered the best management practice due to its inherent capacity for reducing the soil nutrient content and because it has minor implications for soil physical properties.",29,3,410,418,Soil structure; Geology; Infiltration (hydrology); Soil science; Soil water; Cambisol; Sorptivity; Hydrology; Hydraulic conductivity; Porosity; Bulk density,,,,,http://oceanrep.geomar.de/25155/ https://core.ac.uk/display/52249130 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sum.12043 http://eprints.uni-kiel.de/25155/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.12043,,10.1111/sum.12043,1990747810,,0,003-216-656-311-031; 003-728-899-949-75X; 012-418-024-310-761; 020-101-432-680-424; 022-427-726-413-164; 030-466-315-731-135; 031-816-641-103-461; 032-664-418-096-218; 034-095-942-799-599; 038-685-402-758-927; 045-624-352-451-621; 050-192-580-951-948; 051-710-862-228-735; 060-539-073-845-107; 062-801-697-507-150; 064-139-220-743-024; 064-856-446-927-469; 067-095-582-035-356; 070-129-859-863-682; 070-686-985-257-87X; 070-820-334-352-472; 073-409-539-406-517; 074-156-419-052-56X; 076-947-241-078-01X; 085-909-140-788-564; 086-726-626-342-372; 088-236-621-248-724; 092-151-860-414-648; 093-484-116-981-515; 098-849-871-898-660; 099-322-607-299-760; 099-584-998-034-531; 102-085-103-343-879; 102-901-034-424-714; 111-584-131-127-56X; 115-828-139-106-29X; 125-309-565-634-907; 128-086-359-199-469; 129-212-200-486-408; 132-407-745-291-211; 137-422-756-980-765; 153-926-133-004-898; 155-077-672-111-552; 158-040-572-868-750; 161-909-813-971-983; 166-070-010-412-644,4

Sown grass strips harbour high weed diversity but decrease weed richness in adjacent crops. Weed Research 52, 88–97.; ; ; ; Summary; ; Sown grass strips have been widely established on field margins across France, because of their expected environmental benefits. They may also enhance the diversity of plant species in the adjacent boundary by buffering them from agricultural practices. However, the strips could act as an extended reservoir for weeds and increase their dispersal into the field. This study evaluated the impact of a 5-m-wide sown grass strip on (i) the weed richness, abundance and diversity of both boundary and field adjacent habitats and on (ii) the width of the edge zone within the field, defined as the zone where boundary habitats impact the flora in the field. We surveyed the flora in 10 fields along continuous transects running from the boundary toward the centre of the field on opposite sides of each field, one side with a sown grass strip and one side without. The establishment of sown grass strips did not change the overall species richness at the field scale, but modified its distribution in the different habitats. In the boundaries, plant species richness, total abundance or diversity (Shannon index) remained unchanged when a sown grass strip was present, whereas these indicators sharply decreased in the crop edge (−10.9 species and −86.4 individuals per 1.25 m2) and in the field margin (−3.6 species and −9.6 individuals per 1.25 m2) where the grass strip was present. Sown grass strips also significantly decreased the width of the edge zone, from 6.5 to 1.5 m for species richness and from 12 to 1 m for species diversity, demonstrating a decrease in weed ingress into the crop.",52,1,88,97,Crop; Habitat; Weed; Diversity index; Species richness; Species diversity; Agronomy; Transect; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephane_Cordeau/publication/255681576_Sown_grass_strips_harbour_high_weed_diversity_but_decrease_weed_richness_in_adjacent_crops/links/00b4952025be0d9170000000.pdf https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2011.00892.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2011.00892.x/abstract https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND44686226 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2011.00892.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2011.00892.x,,10.1111/j.1365-3180.2011.00892.x,1913391954,,0,005-790-227-442-665; 007-243-303-723-240; 012-335-108-074-344; 016-421-756-148-512; 024-397-401-767-800; 031-862-039-493-29X; 043-663-463-772-769; 049-080-560-165-147; 057-001-477-328-971; 059-280-274-716-779; 060-114-103-966-089; 060-708-377-821-918; 065-071-886-701-523; 070-239-213-610-528; 070-365-342-030-594; 073-865-623-324-417; 081-068-405-899-608; 083-123-409-417-778; 083-412-860-749-866; 096-364-192-925-534; 099-982-967-417-832; 102-362-526-374-610; 124-993-652-958-27X; 132-187-296-108-394; 133-048-738-071-733; 151-368-087-827-60X; 152-856-891-760-185; 154-954-037-373-102; 169-228-174-821-424; 180-157-128-386-145; 190-044-180-699-941; 197-798-610-196-806,26

Spruill,"A study was conducted to statistically evaluate the effectiveness of riparian buffers for decreasing nitrate concentrations in ground water and for affecting other chemical constituents. Values for pH, specific conductance, alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), silica, ammonium, phosphorus, iron, and manganese at 28 sites in the Contentnea Creek Basin were significantly higher (p 20 yr) discharging ground water draining areas with riparian buffers compared with areas without riparian buffers. No differences in chloride, nitrate nitrogen, calcium, sodium, and dissolved oxygen concentrations in old ground water between buffer and nonbuffer areas were detected. Comparison of samples of young (<20 yr) discharging ground water samples from buffer and nonbuffer areas indicated significantly higher specific conductance, calcium, chloride, and nitrate nitrogen in nonbuffer areas. Riparian buffers along streams can affect the composition of the hyporheic zone by providing a source of organic carbon to the streambed, which creates reducing geochemical conditions that consequently can affect the chemical quality of old ground water discharging through it. Buffer zones between agricultural fields and streams facilitate dilution of conservative chemical constituents in young ground water that originate from fertilizer applications and also allow denitrification in ground water by providing an adequate source of organic carbon generated by vegetation in the buffer zone. Based on the median chloride and nitrate values for young ground water in the Contentnea Creek Basin, nitrate was 95% lower in buffer areas compared with nonbuffer areas, with a 30 to 35% reduction estimated to be due to dilution and 65 to 70% due to reduction and/ or denitrification.",29,5,1523,1538,Riparian zone; Nitrate; Hyporheic zone; Fertilizer; Water quality; Dissolved organic carbon; Hydrology; Environmental science; Denitrification; Water pollution,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20003010369 https://www.agronomy.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/29/5/JEQ0290051523 https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70022561 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2000.00472425002900050020x https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20003010369.html https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/29/5/JEQ0290051523,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2000.00472425002900050020x,,10.2134/jeq2000.00472425002900050020x,2063533102,,0,,64

Blake; Ben A. Woodcock; Duncan B. Westbury; Peter Sutton; Simon G. Potts,"There are approximately 29,000 ha of grass buffer strips in the UK under Agri-Environment Schemes; however, typically they are floristically poor and as such are of limited biodiversity value. Introducing a sown wildflower component has the potential to increase dramatically the value of these buffer strips for a suite of native species, including butterflies. This study investigates management practices aiming to promote the establishment and maintenance of wildflowers in existing buffer strips. The effectiveness of two methods used to increase the establishment of wildflowers for the benefit of native butterfly species were tested, both individually and in combination. The management practices were: (1) the application of a selective graminicide (fluazifop-P-butyl) which reduces the dominance of competitive grasses; and (2) scarification of the soil which creates germination niches for sown wildflower seeds. A wildflower seed mix consisting of nine species was sown in conjunction with the scarification treatment. Responses of wildflowers and butterflies were monitored for two years after establishment. Results indicate that the combined scarification and graminicide treatment produced the greatest cover and species richness of sown wildflowers. Butterfly abundance, species richness and diversity were positively correlated with sown wildflower species richness, with the highest values in the combined scarification and graminicide treatment. These findings have confirmed the importance of both scarification as a means of introducing wildflower seed into existing buffer strips, and subsequent management using graminicides, for the benefit of butterflies. Application of this approach could provide tools to help butterfly conservation on farmland in the future",15,1-2,221,232,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-010-9339-6,,10.1007/s10841-010-9339-6,,,0,000-329-490-788-869; 013-953-094-252-318; 019-355-665-347-475; 030-453-266-652-445; 031-547-046-777-979; 032-534-502-956-991; 033-543-257-728-557; 035-775-229-294-961; 044-910-571-164-818; 047-946-954-821-823; 048-543-721-099-075; 049-533-144-778-162; 050-907-802-597-89X; 051-507-795-674-335; 055-962-856-109-250; 056-585-869-238-25X; 063-737-331-566-677; 072-897-670-421-690; 073-016-490-458-924; 073-359-404-037-66X; 074-793-529-288-006; 089-820-647-773-411; 090-479-535-234-324; 099-436-086-918-84X; 114-480-653-531-829; 117-345-687-903-78X; 125-995-631-935-63X; 133-048-738-071-733; 171-352-683-438-394,23

While contour hedgerow systems are an effective method for soil water conservation, there are a few studies on its effect in the red soil hilly areas in Southeast China. With a fixed field experiment, we constructed a runoff plot at hilly area in Zhuji County, Zhejiang province, to evaluate the effect of the grass hedgerows in soil water conservation, and to determine the optimized hedgerow patterns. Hemerocallis citrine (HC) and Ophiopogon japonicas (OJ) were selected to build the hedgerows in patterns of one row and two rows. The REE method was used to trace the source of the sediment for a better understanding of the characteristic and mechanism of erosion with hedgerows control. Our results showed that (1) hedgerows reduced erosion and surface runoff by 31.99–67.22% and 15.44–45.11%, respectively; (2) hedgerows delayed the development of rills; (3) hedgerows reduced the soil nutrients loss; (4) hedgerows reshaped the soil physical properties, especially in increasing >0.25 mm water-stable aggregates. Taken together, our results suggest that two-row OJ is the optimized contour hedgerow pattern in the experiment condition, and downward sloping land should have the highest priority to take measures for soil water conservation. This research comprehensively studied the effects and mechanism of contour hedgerows in controlling soil and water loss in red soil hilly areas, Southeast China, so that the practice of soil and water conservation can be implemented more effectively in these areas.",30,2,107,116,Soil conservation; Erosion; Soil water; Sediment; Soil nutrients; Fixed field; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Agroforestry; Red soil,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1001627915000037,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsrc.2015.03.001,,10.1016/j.ijsrc.2015.03.001,254803008,,0,000-795-980-515-204; 000-987-201-023-021; 002-430-400-638-330; 002-916-363-298-786; 003-288-437-442-19X; 004-067-478-858-260; 004-888-878-452-882; 005-977-897-976-981; 008-262-416-247-172; 011-352-218-713-870; 012-133-504-974-402; 019-786-820-772-039; 020-746-656-930-427; 024-667-507-824-436; 028-830-422-813-669; 036-308-750-685-430; 042-417-252-147-728; 046-498-659-189-092; 046-864-730-255-927; 047-681-130-465-570; 050-630-261-109-566; 052-256-893-842-403; 052-696-208-948-648; 054-232-154-759-995; 056-784-300-497-224; 058-822-796-281-220; 060-335-125-908-604; 061-964-645-875-912; 068-706-657-761-472; 077-657-217-475-358; 080-321-243-422-726; 085-752-598-024-838; 090-922-565-063-718; 094-500-765-119-558; 097-311-819-910-510; 102-536-063-686-913; 109-463-668-363-535; 109-953-506-304-374; 111-591-686-489-164; 116-339-031-779-029; 122-135-236-013-871; 126-133-118-875-645; 126-769-600-146-583; 128-704-477-427-464; 132-831-930-123-597; 133-817-779-828-150; 150-120-916-668-808; 154-450-759-160-37X; 160-853-050-682-668; 165-630-103-608-351; 169-670-736-733-314; 171-287-689-167-136; 180-111-929-801-202; 192-341-972-259-42X; 195-682-433-825-36X; 198-752-445-354-921,11

101-256-219-333-506,Apparent competition or apparent mutualism? An analysis of the influence of rose bush strip management on aphid population in wheat field,,2007,journal article,Journal of Applied Entomology,09312048; 14390418,Wiley,United Kingdom,Isabelle Frère; Jean Fabry; Thierry Hance,"Apparent competition, mediated by a shared predator, plays a key role in conservation biological control. Appropriate agroecosystems management may favour this type of indirect interaction. In that context, our aim was to test the effect of rose bush [Rosa rugosa (Thunb.)] strips on the building up of aphid populations and of their natural enemies in adjacent cereal habitats. Several aphid species are currently found on Rosa sp. including Metopolophium dirhodum (Walker) for which it is a primary host. Aphid predators and parasitoids may build their populations on the aphid population present on Rosa sp. and later on migrate to wheat field during the cereal aphid infestation. Moreover, the flowers of the rose bushes may provide a source of nectar and pollen to these natural enemies. Our experiment was conducted in three rose margin wheat plots with a strip of rose bushes of R. rugosa and three control plots. Plots were compared during 2 years (2003 and 2004). Aphid, parasitoid and predator densities were recorded from May to the harvest of wheat on rose bushes and in wheat. In 2003, the aphid densities were moderate but in 2004, the population of aphid was very high. Even if predator and parasitoids arrived earlier in rose margin field than in control ones, the presence of rose bushes did not influence the aphid population within the field. Metopolophium dirhodum did not seem to migrate from the rose bushes to wheat. The level of parasitism was weak in rose bushes and the natural enemy population was not different in rose margin wheat and in control plots.

Denitrifier community abundance, denitrifier community structure, denitrification gene expression and activity were quantified on three dates in a maize field and adjacent riparian zone. N2O emissions were greater in the agricultural zone, whereas complete denitrification to N2 was greater in the riparian zone. In general, the targeted denitrifier community abundance did not change between agricultural and riparian zones. However, nosZ gene expression was greater in the riparian zone than the agricultural zone. The community structure of nirS -gene-bearing denitrifiers differed in June only, whereas the nirK -gene-bearing community structure differed significantly between the riparian and the agricultural zones at all dates. The nirK -gene-bearing community structure was correlated with soil pH, while no significant correlations were found between nirS -gene-bearing community structure and soil environmental variables or N2O emissions, denitrification or denitrifier enzyme activity. The results suggested for the nirK and nirS -gene-bearing communities different factors control abundance vs. community structure.

Karr; William J. Showers; J. Wendell Gilliam; A. Scott Andres,"Natural-abundance delta15N showed that nitrate generated from commercial land application of swine (Sus scrofa domesticus) waste within a North Carolina Coastal Plain catchment was being discharged to surface waters by ground water passing beneath the sprayfields and adjacent riparian buffers. This was significant because intensive swine farms in North Carolina are considered non-discharge operations, and riparian buffers with minimum widths of 7.6 m (25 ft) are the primary regulatory control on ground water export of nitrate from these operations. This study shows that such buffers are not always adequate to prevent discharge of concentrated nitrate in ground water from commercial swine farms in the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain, and that additional measures are required to ensure non-discharge conditions. The median delta15N-total N of liquids in site swine waste lagoons was +15.4 +/- 0.2% vs. atmospheric nitrogen. The median delta15N-NO3 values of shallow ground water beneath and adjacent to site sprayfields, a stream draining sprayfields, and waters up to 1.5 km downstream were + 15.3 +/- 0.2 to + 15.4 +/- 0.2%. Seasonal and spatial isotopic variations in lagoons and well waters were greatly homogenized during ground water transport and discharge to streams. Neither denitrification nor losses of ammonia during spraying significantly altered the bulk ground water delta15N signal being delivered to streams. The lagoons were sources of chloride and potassium enrichment, and shallow ground water showed strong correlation between nitrate N, potassium, and chloride. The 15N-enriched nitrate in ground water beneath swine waste sprayfields can thus be successfully traced during transport and discharge into nearby surface waters.",30,4,1163,1175,Riparian zone; Coastal plain; Nitrate; Nitrate transport; Hydrology; Environmental science; Denitrification; Groundwater; Surface water; Environmental engineering; Water pollution,,"Agriculture; Ammonia/analysis; Animals; Ecosystem; Nitrates/analysis; Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis; Soil Pollutants/analysis; Swine; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Movements; Water Pollutants/analysis",Nitrates; Nitrogen Isotopes; Soil Pollutants; Water Pollutants; Ammonia,University of North Carolina; North Carolina Pork Producers Association,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6664524 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2001.3041163x https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/30/4/1163 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11476493 http://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2134/jeq2001.3041163x https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/pdfs/30/4/1163,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2001.3041163x,11476493,10.2134/jeq2001.3041163x,2084080462,,0,002-320-578-563-973; 003-261-661-694-180; 006-017-352-131-346; 006-360-950-769-751; 007-139-886-752-317; 008-504-704-938-364; 008-617-825-775-304; 013-757-769-090-436; 013-930-883-934-117; 017-133-673-431-320; 018-885-925-850-336; 020-323-533-404-14X; 021-227-002-702-937; 022-220-231-700-796; 022-249-710-918-839; 032-575-664-976-54X; 040-170-533-305-695; 043-600-979-673-165; 044-256-125-038-404; 059-571-800-956-52X; 065-460-512-619-452; 066-683-690-752-592; 080-589-148-600-106; 087-138-533-405-771; 087-140-737-648-233; 089-729-272-444-541; 091-116-792-999-794; 095-222-094-651-277; 098-329-079-646-874; 112-735-288-596-032; 114-768-927-961-248; 132-180-223-576-427; 132-186-585-542-192; 135-762-994-419-066; 138-762-735-726-300; 155-385-501-323-897; 156-695-704-869-697; 161-647-220-677-116; 168-149-351-696-563,102

Gantzer; Stephen H. Anderson; E. E. Alberts,"Vegetative filter strips (FS) perform poorly for reducing losses of sediment and nutrients in concentrated flow. Stiff-stemmed grass barriers (B-FS) above the FS may be a companion treatment to improve the FS performance. This study evaluated the effectiveness of warm-season switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) barriers planted above fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) FS in reducing runoff water, sediment, N, and P losses in concentrated flow from an Aeric Vertic Epiaqualf on a 5% slope. Simulated rainfall was applied on plots consisting of a 1.5-m-wide by 8-m-long pollutant source area with an artificially constructed channel to concentrate surface runoff. The source area was bounded downslope by either an 8-m long fescue FS or 0.7 m of active or dormant barrier above a 7.3-m-long fescue FS. The B-FS treatment also reduced sediment loss by 91% while the FS reduced sediment by only 72% (P < 0.01). The B-FS also reduced sediment loss by 90%, whereas FS reduced sediment only 60% when inflow was added to the plots. The B-FS trapped 4.9 times more organic N, 2.3 times more NH 4 -N, and 3.7 times more particulate P than FS at 0.7 m (P < 0.01). Sediment and nutrient trapping increased significantly with FS length. Switchgrass barriers above the FS dispersed and temporarily ponded concentrated runoff, enabling increased sediment deposition.

There is currently no curative treatment available to control wireworms, and preventive treatments are mainly chemical. We therefore need to better understand factors that rule damage for developing agroecological control strategies. In this investigation, we tested the effect of agricultural practices and local landscape on wireworm damage in maize crops. We surveyed wireworm damage in 341 fields under various conditions in western France in 2011 and 2012. We used in particular a random forest algorithm to impute missing values and an automated model selection routine to select the best beta regression model. Our results show that the occurrence of grassland in the rotation increases wireworm damage. Tillage also shows a high influence, though varying with season and year. Wireworm damage is decreased by the presence of hedges or cultivated crops at the field border, whereas it is increased by the presence of grassland at the field border. Overall, our findings provide some insights to develop preventive solutions for the sustainable control of wireworms, as well as a framework for data processing to analyze a wide range of similar situations involving other crops and pests.",35,2,793,802,Agriculture; Agroecology; Tillage; Grassland; Beta regression; Curative treatment; Crop protection; Agroforestry; Scale (social sciences); Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01284300/document https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs13593-014-0279-5.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13593-014-0279-5 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01284300,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-014-0279-5,,10.1007/s13593-014-0279-5,1988522076,,0,003-995-290-828-321; 010-126-263-188-487; 011-433-452-202-125; 013-610-647-331-186; 014-722-119-842-735; 015-611-720-732-777; 019-662-289-090-564; 021-021-879-814-114; 021-276-230-258-509; 025-987-982-793-607; 028-237-504-948-367; 029-269-886-943-061; 029-863-423-297-632; 033-124-054-887-703; 046-766-508-337-383; 046-851-860-385-698; 047-915-844-175-136; 053-882-087-587-342; 057-173-163-207-385; 065-099-112-753-009; 065-652-561-622-304; 066-304-772-058-083; 068-096-946-517-526; 072-802-531-827-848; 076-863-055-982-955; 083-735-425-371-439; 084-387-070-806-39X; 088-400-571-350-393; 092-220-232-726-188; 105-089-012-191-379; 111-577-747-999-870; 124-812-329-736-102; 134-312-556-034-559; 138-363-976-718-24X; 149-250-414-297-242; 150-325-162-873-23X; 158-758-956-255-657,17

Mickelson; James L. Baker; D. P. Tierney; C. J. Peters,"Effectiveness of vegetative buffer strips for herbicide retention from agricultural runoff was evaluated in a two-year natural rainfall study. A source area of 0.41 ha (mainly Canisteo silty clay loam soil), having an average slope of 3%, was fall chisel-plowed, spring disked, and planted to corn. Three herbicides (atrazine, metolachlor, and cyanazine) were applied to the source area in each spring. Six vegetative buffer strips, 1.52 m wide ¥ 20.12 m long, were isolated with metal borders downslope of the source area in a well established bromegrass (Bromus inermis) waterway. These strips provided for three replications of two drainage to buffer area ratio treatments of 15:1 and 30:1. Herbicide retention was dependent on the antecedent moisture conditions of the strips. These retentions ranged from 11 to 100% for atrazine, 16 to 100% for metolachlor, and 8 to 100% for cyanazine. Herbicide retention by the buffer strips for the two treatments were not significantly different for the observed storm events. Herbicide concentrations in solution in outflow from the strips were less than the inflow concentrations for all the three herbicides. Infiltration was the key process for herbicide retention by the buffer strips, although there was some adsorption to in-place soil and/or vegetation. Metolachlor concentrations in sediment increased in outflow for the two treatments; however, the opposite was true for atrazine and cyanazine. Herbicide retention by sediment deposition in the strip represented about 5% of the total herbicide retention by the buffer strips. The buffer strips were found to have high percent sediment retention, ranging from 40 to 100%; thus, the strips would be more effective for retaining strongly adsorbed herbicides.",39,6,2155,2162,Loam; Infiltration (hydrology); Antecedent moisture; Metolachlor; Atrazine; Bromus inermis; Hydrology; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Agronomy,,,,,https://elibrary.asabe.org/abstract.asp?aid=27719 https://works.bepress.com/steven_mickelson/28/ http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/abe_eng_pubs/4/ https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=abe_eng_pubs https://core.ac.uk/display/38933286 https://core.ac.uk/download/38933286.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/2013.27719,,10.13031/2013.27719,2061112163,,0,014-561-967-561-763; 034-748-846-517-673; 051-778-290-958-089; 052-894-240-545-387; 073-564-601-864-691; 076-826-572-086-275; 130-940-780-158-38X; 140-725-847-725-141,117

Anderson and Dr. Ranjith Udawatta.Vita.Ph. D. University of Missouri--Columbia 2009.Agroforestry buffers, a system of land use in which harvestable trees or shrubs are grown among or around crops or on pastureland, have been proposed for improving water quality in watersheds. The objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate saturated hydraulic conductivity (K[subscript sat]) and water retention for soils managed under rotationally-grazed pasture (RG), continuously grazed pasture (CG), grass buffers (GB), and agroforestry buffers (AgB); (ii) to compare differences in computed tomography (CT)-measured macropore ([greater than] 1000-[micrometer] diam.) and coarse mesopore (200- to 1000-[micrometer] diam.) parameters for AgB, GB, RG and CG treatments, and to examine relationships between CTmeasured pore parameters and K[subscript sat] ; (iii) to compare the influence of AgB and GB systems under rotationally stocked (RG) and continuously stocked (CG) pasture systems on water infiltration measured using ponded infiltration and tension infiltration methods; (iv) to evaluate differences in root length density (RLD) and root and soil carbon content within GB, AgB, RG and CG treatments; and (v) to model runoff and sediment losses for grazed pasture watersheds with and without AgB buffers. Pasture and GB areas included red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) and lespedeza (Kummerowia stipulacea Maxim.) planted into fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) while AgB included Eastern cottonwood trees (Populus deltoids Bortr. ex Marsh.) planted into fescue. Soil bulk density was 12.6% higher for the pasture treatments compared to buffer treatments. Soil water content at high soil water potentials (0 and -0.4 kPa) was greater in the buffer treatments relative to pasture treatments for the 0-10 cm soil depth. Soil macroporosity ( [greater than] 1000 [micrometer] diam.) was 5.7, 4.5, and 3.9 times higher, respectively, for the AgB, GB, and RG treatments compared to the CG treatment for the 0-10 cm soil depth. Buffer treatments had greater macroporosity ( [greater than] 1000-[micrometer] diam.), coarse (60- to 1000-[micrometer] diam.) and fine mesoporosity (10 to 60 [micrometer] diam.) but lower microporosity ( [less than] 10 [micrometer] diam.) compared to pasture treatments. The K[subscript sat] for the buffer treatments was 16.7 times higher compared with pasture treatments. The CT-measured soil macroporosity was 13 times higher (0.053 m[superscript 3] m[superscript -3]) for the buffer treatments compared to the pasture treatments (0.004 m[superscript 3] m[superscript -3]) for the surface 0-10 cm soil depth. Buffer treatments had greater CT-measured macroporosity (0.019 m[superscript 3] m[superscript -3]) compared to pasture (0.0045 m[superscript 3] m[superscript -3]) treatments. The CTmeasured pore parameters (except macropore circularity) were positively correlated with K[subscript sat]. Quasi-steady state infiltration rates (qs) and field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) for buffers were about 30 and 40 times higher compared to pasture treatments, respectively. Green-Ampt and Parlange models appeared to fit measured data with r[superscript 2] values ranging from 0.91 to 0.98. The infiltration rate in 2007 for the GB treatment was the highest (221 mm h[superscript -1]) and for the CG treatment was the lowest (3.7 mm h[superscript -1]). Estimated sorptivity (S) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) parameters were higher for buffer areas compared to the stocked pasture areas. Grazing reduced the infiltration rate for the pasture treatments. Buffer treatments had 4.5 times higher RLD as compared to pasture treatments. The AgB treatment had the highest (173.5 cm/100 cm[superscript 3]) and CG had the lowest (10.8 cm/100 cm[superscript 3] ) RLD. Root carbon was about 3% higher for the buffers compared to RG treatment. Soil carbon was about 115% higher for the buffers compared to pasture treatments. This study illustrates that agroforestry and grass buffers maintained higher values for soil hydraulic properties compared to grazed pasture systems. The CTstudy illustrates the benefits of agroforestry and grass buffers for maintaining soil pore parameters critical for soil water transport. Results from the infiltration study conclude that the buffer areas have higher infiltration rates which imply lower runoff compared to pasture areas. The root study implies that establishment of agroforestry and grass buffers on grazed pasture watersheds improves soil carbon accumulation and root parameters which enhance soil physical and chemical properties, thus improving the environmental quality of the landscape. The Agricultural Policy Extender (APEX) model was used to simulate runoff and sediment losses from the AgB watersheds and control (CW) watersheds. The model was calibrated from 2002 to 2005 and was validated from 2005 to 2008. The r[sperscript 2] and NSE values for the calibration and validation period of the runoff varied from 0.52 to 0.78 and 0.51 to 0.74, respectively. The model did not predict sediment loss very well (NSE values were less than 0.19) because of insufficient measured events. The measured runoff was 36% lower for AgB watersheds compared to CW watersheds. The measured sediment loss for the AgB watersheds was about 49% lower compared to CW watersheds. The model was run for long-term scenario analyses from 1999 to 2008. The runoff decreased 24% when the buffer width was doubled. The runoff from the AgB watersheds was 9.8% lower with double stocking densities compared to CW watersheds with double stocking densities. Results of these studies indicate that establishment of agroforestry and grass buffers on grazed pasture watersheds improve soil hydraulic properties, pore parameters, soil carbon sequestration and water quality indices and thus contribute to enhance overall environmental quality.Includes bibliographical reference",,,,,Sediment; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Agroforestry,,,,,https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/handle/10355/9867 https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/10355/9867/1/public.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/62769105.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.32469/10355/9867,,10.32469/10355/9867,2237941892,,0,,1

Butt; Lauri Jauhiainen,"Abstract To study the feasibility of earthworm introduction for increasing the macroporosity and permeability of arable heavy clay, deep-burrowing earthworms ( Lumbricus terrestris L.) were inoculated into a tile drained experimental field in Jokioinen, S-W Finland in autumn 1996. Inoculation with the Earthworm Inoculation Unit technique was at the up-slope end of the field, in the field margins under permanent grass, and inside the four 0.46 ha plots of the field. The experiment was monitored on three occasions. In 1998 the L. terrestris population had persisted in low numbers only in field and plot margins. By 2003, when the field had been under set-aside grass for three years, density had grown in the margins and L. terrestris were also found inside the field at a very low density. The third monitoring was in autumn 2009, after a further four years as set-aside and a subsequent division of the field into no-till and ploughing management, and looked at the effects of management (margins, no-till, ploughing), distance from the inoculation and sub-drainage on L. terrestris abundance. The abundance displayed a clear gradient over the field, declining from 14 ind. and 18 g m −2 at 5–9 m from inoculation, to 1 ind. and 2 g m −2 at 56–60 m distance.

Finn,"Field margins within intensively managed ecosystems are often seen as a last refuge for biodiversity, and are typically targeted with measures within many agri-environment schemes. Grassland accounts for 81 million ha of land within the EU; however, the ecology of field margins associated with permanent grassland has not been well studied.; This study investigated the effects of experimental field margin measures on hymenopteran parasitoid communities over a 5-year period. Hymenopteran parasitoids were chosen because they occupy high trophic levels, feed on a diverse range of plant and invertebrate hosts, and are considered good indicators of arthropod diversity. Establishment methods included: fencing, natural regeneration, and reseeding with a wildflower mixture, at three margin widths.; Field margin establishment method had a significant effect on abundance of parasitoids. Establishment method did not have a significant effect on parasitoid genera diversity, but did affect parasitoid community composition. Margin width had no significant impact on parasitoid communities.; Grazing had a significant negative effect on parasitoid genus richness and community structure. This suggests that structural diversity of vegetation plays an important role in parasitoid community structure.; Plant species richness did not significantly affect parasitoid abundance or genera richness. Noxious species within plots resulted in a significantly greater abundance and diversity of parasitoids and of idiobionts in particular.; Where plant species richness is limited, simple measures such as fencing of narrow field margins may be as effective at increasing parasitoid taxon richness and abundance (indicators of arthropod richness and abundance) as expensive measures such as reseeding and wider margin widths.",7,4,289,307,Biodiversity; Community structure; Ecology; Range (biology); Wildflower; Parasitoid; Species richness; Agroforestry; Trophic level; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/icad.12053,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.12053,,10.1111/icad.12053,2032156375,,0,007-827-850-871-938; 008-225-619-668-580; 009-822-308-687-313; 011-749-985-776-165; 014-958-779-249-778; 018-426-147-707-10X; 020-024-935-817-641; 023-021-561-291-862; 023-103-648-255-011; 026-509-531-770-449; 036-882-579-432-228; 037-547-963-308-123; 038-029-010-387-455; 043-940-041-145-856; 044-351-103-625-865; 047-714-489-102-360; 049-309-154-725-404; 052-517-123-538-571; 054-715-078-148-813; 055-236-476-487-210; 056-244-188-471-763; 056-789-845-462-569; 059-361-082-177-816; 059-502-071-789-055; 060-114-103-966-089; 063-617-276-329-073; 069-654-050-639-272; 071-363-274-178-219; 074-793-529-288-006; 080-120-873-723-637; 081-198-292-463-95X; 082-858-046-996-889; 086-094-963-141-341; 087-776-438-025-769; 093-861-925-204-733; 095-014-169-963-827; 097-691-909-747-128; 107-183-594-896-961; 113-084-844-855-534; 117-077-367-592-718; 117-345-687-903-78X; 120-604-030-739-18X; 131-084-244-740-031; 133-858-248-195-498; 145-523-815-049-35X; 150-260-537-510-335; 151-330-634-368-382; 154-473-168-035-456; 155-691-175-864-748; 160-321-842-724-056; 197-392-866-862-614,9

Three types of margins were divided according to the volume of tall vegetation, i.e. herbaceous, shrubby, and tree lined. Fifty breeding bird species were recorded, with a mean density of 33.2 pairs/km. The dominant species were non-threatened and were characteristic of forests or of the field-forest mosaic. Tree lined margins showed the highest abundance and bird species richness. Shrubby margins supported the second highest, while open habitats ranked last. Abundances in ecological guilds were affected by the margin type, the presence of field roads, and especially the presence of ditches in the margin structure. Redundancy Analysis showed clear differences in bird communities between the discernable types of field margins. Species richness increased in the combinations of various margin types.

L. Luff; Carlo Leifert,"Abstract Ground beetles were sampled in nine crops and four field boundary types on a split conventional/organic farm in northern England in the five years 2005–2009. Multivariate analyses indicated that a combination of crop type, management and boundary type influenced ground beetle species and group activity. Short vegetation boundaries with bare ground had similar activity, mainly of small species, to that in organic arable crops, contrasting with activity in conventional arable and more densely vegetated boundaries. Large, medium-sized, herbivorous and Collembola feeding species all had considerable activity in oilseed rape and activity was generally greatest in conventional arable crops but least in conventional grass. Disturbance and productivity estimations provided basic insights into ground beetle activity. Most small and medium-sized species were found in areas with low productivity but high and low disturbance, respectively. Large and Collembola feeding species were most active in highly productive areas with medium and low disturbance whilst most herbivorous species preferred medium values of both drivers. In crops, species richness was greatest in organic beans and conventional oilseed rape and lowest in conventional grass. There were more species in short vegetation boundaries than in more densely vegetated field edges. There may be potential for the use of productivity and disturbance estimations in the provision of ecosystem services, especially in assessing the conditions required to optimise ground beetle activity for pest control.",165,,60,67,Organic farming; Productivity (ecology); Vegetation; Ecology; Disturbance (ecology); Ground beetle; Environmental science; Species richness; Agroecosystem; Agronomy; Arable land,,,,,https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/190529 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880912004549 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880912004549,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2012.12.009,,10.1016/j.agee.2012.12.009,2052944080,,0,002-669-586-055-41X; 005-206-260-974-756; 005-303-491-148-085; 009-909-414-518-97X; 010-481-775-420-493; 012-136-156-420-967; 013-526-378-431-354; 016-290-311-402-912; 018-827-921-966-336; 022-766-590-869-635; 029-264-530-643-997; 032-807-208-218-884; 033-921-880-855-043; 035-335-736-366-844; 036-259-010-837-779; 038-950-105-220-885; 039-283-365-632-704; 040-889-306-687-168; 043-844-491-270-048; 046-580-717-487-315; 050-985-622-056-969; 056-892-630-404-500; 057-320-496-419-500; 057-720-330-037-206; 057-981-598-792-734; 061-017-051-481-03X; 064-975-099-130-640; 070-162-490-783-176; 070-194-102-378-889; 081-187-254-788-856; 081-876-742-456-651; 086-525-130-009-786; 090-752-142-466-663; 091-265-753-392-171; 092-286-036-576-532; 095-662-270-254-510; 098-035-451-831-547; 101-084-804-544-365; 106-866-820-349-832; 108-396-753-252-799; 114-646-769-502-277; 117-361-487-287-804; 122-339-404-455-420; 125-265-159-043-51X; 130-190-390-087-555; 131-261-344-144-063; 144-700-882-404-647; 148-789-623-443-683; 150-827-413-891-88X; 164-059-355-030-246; 171-881-028-282-497; 181-602-781-774-289; 191-245-265-713-754,46

Secondary functions include reducing runoff volume and velocity and retaining sediments and harmful substances from adjacent fields. Grass cover (sward)-damaging sedimentation in the GWW is commonly reduced by frequent mowing, but in doing so the effectiveness of the waterway relative to the secondary functions is reduced. Our objectives were to (i) evaluate whether the maintenance of a GWW can be reduced if on-site erosion control is effective, (ii) measure the effectiveness of such a GWW, and (iii) analyze the underlying mechanisms. A long-term (1994-2000) landscape experiment was performed in four watersheds, where two had GWWs for which maintenance was largely neglected. An intensive soil conservation system was established on all fields. Runoff and sediment delivery were continuously measured in the two watersheds with GWWs and in their paired watersheds that were similar, but without GWWs. Runoff was reduced by 90 and 10% for the two sets of paired watersheds, respectively. The different efficiencies of the GWWs resulted from different layouts (doubled width and flat-bottomed vs. v-shaped drainageway). The GWWs reduced sediment delivery by 97 and 77%, respectively, but the sward was not damaged by sedimentation. Grain sizes > 50 microm were settled due to gravity in both GWWs. Smaller grain sizes were primarily settled due to infiltration, which increased with a more effective runoff reduction. In general, the results indicated a high potential of GWWs for reducing runoff volume and velocity, sediments, and agrochemicals coming from agricultural watersheds.",32,3,927,936,Soil conservation; Infiltration (hydrology); Plant cover; Grassed waterway; Erosion control; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Drainage; Environmental engineering,,"Agriculture; Biodegradation, Environmental; Conservation of Natural Resources; Filtration; Geologic Sediments/chemistry; Pesticides/isolation & purification; Poaceae; Rain; Water Movements",Pesticides,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research,https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/32/3/927 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/12809293 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2134/jeq2003.9270 https://www.agronomy.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/32/3/927 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12809293,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2003.9270,12809293,10.2134/jeq2003.9270,2027436310,,0,000-392-869-437-299; 002-916-363-298-786; 010-986-832-547-110; 014-082-686-261-694; 024-393-371-460-382; 029-227-515-568-324; 045-514-180-097-787; 052-472-972-493-471; 062-158-704-164-476; 083-431-696-176-966; 093-807-963-624-926; 096-145-122-087-467; 111-288-588-656-115; 117-342-446-985-725; 130-940-780-158-38X; 151-714-568-529-936; 160-087-225-408-274; 170-591-128-283-41X,127

Bryce Cooper; James G. Cooke,"Abstract The processes of nitrate removal from the stream waters of 2 headwater catchments were studied. In study stretches where the stream channels were vegetated with thick mats of grass (Gly‐ceria fluitans), nitrate removal processes were particularly active. In such grassed stream channels, c. 75% of the nitrate removal was attributable to plant uptake and the remainder to denitrifica‐tion. Both of these nitrate removal processes were linearly dependent on nitrate concentration, resulting in an exponential decline of nitrate level from the springs along the stream's length. Regeneration of nitrogen, by plant decay within the stream channel, results in export of dissolved organic nitrogen and paniculate nitrogen from the catchments. The overall impact of vegetated stream channels in modifying nitrogen exports from catchments is discussed.",18,4,441,450,Eutrophication; Nitrate; Glyceria fluitans; Dissolved organic nitrogen; Nouvelle zelande; Hydrology; Environmental science; STREAMS; Nitrogen; Denitrification,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00288330.1984.9516065 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00288330.1984.9516065,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1984.9516065,,10.1080/00288330.1984.9516065,2091578440,,0,012-588-468-002-243; 014-360-662-608-646; 020-004-932-299-545; 041-559-307-895-617; 043-857-772-705-514; 054-544-390-113-144; 060-139-646-563-121; 064-617-377-332-614; 070-348-680-626-45X; 074-973-021-133-191; 076-936-833-080-013; 076-961-973-996-036; 109-376-461-877-242; 115-492-918-423-060; 119-725-206-462-264; 127-528-671-745-38X; 147-163-245-110-222,94

We installed pan traps to sample bees (i) on the grasslands; (ii) on grassland edges behind adjacent hedges (potential barriers) and without hedges; (iii) on grass strips in 100 m distance to the grassland, which were connected or unconnected to the grassland; and (iv) unconnected (isolated) grass strips in 300 m and 750 m distance to test for corridor and isolation effects on abundance and species richness of foraging wild bees. Additionally we provided trap nests for bees, wasps and their parasitoids on the grasslands and the strips. Species abundance and richness declined with increasing isolation from grasslands for foraging solitary bees, trap-nesting bees, wasps and parasitoids, but not for foraging bumblebees. Hedges did not confine movement of foraging bees. We found no mitigating effects of (100 m) corridor strips on any of the observed groups. We conclude that conservation of semi-natural habitats as sources of bee and wasp diversity is important and that grass strips act as sinks rather than corridors when high quality patches are nearby.",144,6,1816,1825,Foraging; Habitat; Ecology; Grassland; Hymenoptera; Biological dispersal; Species richness; Habitat destruction; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632071100108X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2011.03.014,,10.1016/j.biocon.2011.03.014,1996032801,,0,000-890-614-606-582; 001-246-459-283-910; 002-133-948-308-90X; 002-874-438-870-319; 004-370-090-982-806; 006-314-244-124-537; 007-494-766-607-98X; 010-888-549-334-33X; 011-113-313-615-090; 011-968-803-898-621; 012-033-161-699-147; 013-144-739-926-739; 013-210-533-072-945; 017-435-062-399-767; 018-146-325-957-472; 022-321-534-473-933; 022-392-117-877-556; 023-723-497-317-63X; 024-216-425-669-724; 024-678-140-869-569; 030-772-307-005-606; 031-712-522-366-166; 034-333-107-858-752; 034-545-089-756-967; 037-325-128-567-400; 037-649-247-809-59X; 043-023-106-534-265; 043-455-371-359-823; 044-778-335-103-807; 049-091-169-377-597; 050-229-016-868-066; 051-507-795-674-335; 054-328-419-977-493; 055-439-916-692-702; 056-064-713-708-207; 057-420-111-160-322; 057-952-034-105-06X; 062-218-780-389-812; 063-200-626-013-076; 065-346-869-208-139; 066-376-824-715-720; 067-277-473-537-389; 068-452-604-669-157; 071-440-619-654-476; 072-090-852-140-219; 072-547-204-496-863; 073-335-262-644-942; 075-182-328-430-399; 075-666-685-673-883; 078-419-232-375-219; 080-348-794-816-190; 082-749-794-113-073; 086-096-752-108-057; 086-182-699-354-136; 086-268-358-012-610; 089-814-414-976-137; 094-506-716-348-263; 099-188-994-062-936; 100-095-274-356-160; 104-625-941-609-08X; 114-043-557-281-537; 126-023-573-704-955; 128-892-311-920-110; 129-422-118-125-350; 131-508-903-583-735; 144-295-536-484-748; 145-176-906-866-327; 146-977-228-707-912; 156-547-582-169-232; 165-420-840-117-725; 184-899-964-527-087,96

Hubbard; G. L. Newton; John M. Ruter,"A farm-scale study was conducted from 2000 to 2004 to determine the effectiveness of grass-forest vegetated buffers in assimilating nitrogen (N) from overland flow application of swine lagoon effluent. The rationale for the study was that replicated buffer plot studies had shown that vegetated buffers will effectively assimilate N, but it was not known whether or not they would work at a larger scale. The study was conducted on a commercial farm near Tifton, Georgia. Wastewater was pumped from a single-stage anaerobic lagoon to vegetated buffers composed of grass and mature or newly planted pines. The buffers approximated 60 m in length by 90 m in width. The upper 10 m of each buffer was in grass, while the downslope area was in mature or newly planted pines. Six buffers were instrumented for wastewater application and water quality monitoring. Two buffers received wastewater at a 1X rate (600 kg N ha-1 year-1), two at a 3/4X rate (450 kg N ha-1 year-1), and two served as controls. The wastewater was applied to the 10 m grassed portion of the buffers. Transects of shallow groundwater wells starting at the grass-forest interface and running downslope were used to monitor water quality N. The study showed mixed results concerning N assimilation by the buffers. Upslope land use changes by the producer during the study added significant N inputs to one set of buffers, and they were unable to assimilate sufficient N from both these inputs and the wastewater to protect shallow groundwater quality. In contrast, almost all samplings of shallow groundwater under the buffers receiving N only from the overland flow applied swine lagoon effluent showed nitrate (NO3-N) concentrations 20 and 30 m downslope to be lower than 10 mg L-1 (drinking water standard). On these buffers, NO3-N concentrations in shallow groundwater were near background levels five years after wastewater application commenced. The study indicated that the ratio of buffer area width to wastewater application area width on the landscape should be at least 1:1, and that buffers for protection of water quality should be continuous on the landscape. It was concluded from the study that buffers can be used at the farm scale to assimilate N from applied wastewater when they are sufficiently wide relative to waste application area, rate, and other N sources at the farm scale.",50,1,53,64,Biodegradable waste; Effluent; Nitrate; Anaerobic lagoon; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Groundwater; Environmental engineering; Wastewater,,,,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/10721 http://elibrary.asabe.org/abstract.asp??JID=3&AID=22411,http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/2013.22411,,10.13031/2013.22411,2075087715,,0,001-487-853-597-667; 002-916-363-298-786; 015-325-416-202-141; 030-952-205-937-160; 040-507-938-290-621; 055-590-572-243-787; 064-240-859-714-503; 064-656-269-307-94X; 075-695-242-426-755; 085-980-507-337-463; 086-190-138-130-44X; 095-263-397-244-602; 107-914-292-939-854; 108-531-822-357-682; 114-332-933-788-296; 130-940-780-158-38X; 146-884-526-389-710; 175-306-631-667-644; 177-770-652-793-529,3

In the last decade, hedgerow establishment has been encouraged primarily for the prevention of soil erosion, though many farmers view them as reservoirs of invasive weeds and pests. In this study, we compared weed assemblages of several hedgerow types and herbaceous field margins. Ranking that takes into consideration weed abundance was clearly demonstrated: planted hedgerows > herbaceous field margins > natural woody hedgerows. The latter harboured many perennial plant species of less weedy propensity than planted hedgerows, which accommodated a larger number of weedy species. In planted hedgerows close to 50% of plants were weeds, even in their central position, although planted and natural hedgerows sheltered similar weed composition in their central parts. Likewise, most species inventoried in adjacent fields were weeds.

New management protocols for temperate grasslands are needed to reduce the risk of P transport to surface water. The effects of three land-use treatments on soil characteristics related to P runoff were investigated using small watersheds with 8% slope near Booneville, Arkansas, U.S. The land use treatments were (1) haying of bermudagrass overseeded with winter annual forage (ryegrass or rye), (2) rotationally grazed, and (3) rotationally grazed with 12-m-wide tree buffer on the downhill portion of the plot. Plots and trees were established in 2003. Annual spring application of poultry litter (5.6 Mg ha−1) to the hayed or grazed portions of the plots was started in 2004.

Musters; F. van Alebeek; R.H.E.M. Geers; H. Korevaar; A. Visser; G.R. de Snoo,"Taking field margins out of intensive cultivation is a common form of agri-environmental scheme and on-farm nature management. Typically, no nutrients or pesticides are applied in these margins, which may be sown either with a crop or with grasses and native flowering plants. In some cases the margins are mown, while in others they are left alone. Newly established grass margins are less species-rich than field boundaries or road verges with a long history, justifying the expectation that field margins, if properly managed and given time and appropriate seed sources, could develop into relatively species-rich vegetation. We studied the biodiversity of both margins taken out of production and adjacent ditch banks in the years following initial establishment of the margins. To this end we combined the data of three different projects in order to increase the sensitivity of the statistical analyses. The results showed that the plant species richness of the field margins increased in the years following establishment over a period of four years. In addition, shifts in species composition indicated a decrease in soil nitrate concentrations. The species richness of both butterflies and dragonflies may increase. The most striking result was the marked increase in the plant species richness of the adjacent ditch banks in the five years following creation of the margins. Here, too, changes in species composition indicated a decrease in soil nitrate. In the years following establishment of the field margins there was no increase in the cover of agriculturally harmful weeds in these margins. However, the number of harmful nematodes increased. Our results show the short term effect of establishing field margins. Long term effects are still in need for further research",129,1-3,131,139,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2008.08.003,,10.1016/j.agee.2008.08.003,,,0,000-669-594-539-024; 003-460-280-575-85X; 009-608-857-925-41X; 011-508-246-956-659; 014-229-118-471-777; 014-836-735-608-163; 016-421-756-148-512; 020-024-935-817-641; 020-713-595-267-906; 022-101-299-722-48X; 025-307-718-158-485; 025-983-895-963-761; 031-862-039-493-29X; 035-775-229-294-961; 036-164-148-520-238; 040-851-297-121-31X; 042-303-914-852-499; 043-213-251-246-857; 047-946-954-821-823; 050-907-802-597-89X; 052-363-993-930-092; 054-715-078-148-813; 055-083-398-263-398; 056-099-523-856-735; 056-585-869-238-25X; 063-003-550-683-547; 068-452-604-669-157; 069-901-245-663-534; 070-239-213-610-528; 070-314-903-562-073; 074-793-529-288-006; 080-139-567-968-521; 081-820-338-234-026; 101-656-029-176-741; 102-962-233-288-849; 117-345-687-903-78X; 120-237-248-266-299; 124-362-582-173-520; 149-751-397-612-305; 151-368-087-827-60X; 179-268-492-785-894; 185-374-982-166-638; 188-468-956-254-948,18

Thompson,"1. Agricultural intensification has contributed to severe declines in odonate (dragonfly and damselfly) populations. The objective of our study is to benefit current measures for the conservation of odonates by establishing the conditions favourable to Odonata and focusing on ponds within agricultural land. 2. Our landscape-scale study used exuvial counts and habitat measurements from 29 ponds across a catchment in England, over 3 years, to determine key factors affecting odonate abundance and species richness. 3. Ponds dominated by floating and submerged vegetation were the most transparent, supported the highest abundance and species richness of exuviae, and were always fully or partially surrounded by buffer strips. Ponds lacking vegetation were turbid, yielding no exuviae even if they were buffered. English agri-environment schemes (AES) currently support pond and buffer strip creation and management. 4. Abundance of exuviae was higher in recently created ponds compared to older ponds, whereas ponds that had dried out the previous summer had fewer exuviae. 5. Species richness of exuviae decreased with increasing distance to the nearest viable pond, falling by more than 40% for distances over 100 m. 6. We conclude that odonate conservation would be more effective if AES would consider the spatial scale at which ponds are created and the location, type, and quality of ponds targeted for buffer strips.",5,6,422,432,Vegetation; Habitat; Ecology; Dragonfly; Damselfly; Odonata; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Species richness; Abundance (ecology),,,,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/457570 http://publicationslist.org/data/thomas.merckx/ref-47/Raebel%20et%20al%202011_ICD_Identifying%20high-quality%20pond%20habitats%20for%20Odonata%20in%20lowland%20England%20implications%20for%20agri-environment%20schemes.pdf https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1752-4598.2011.00178.x https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/en/object/boreal%3A142441,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-4598.2011.00178.x,,10.1111/j.1752-4598.2011.00178.x,1917116916,,0,000-103-713-547-965; 004-491-262-941-375; 005-483-995-519-67X; 007-289-294-932-086; 008-371-343-064-801; 009-282-548-125-972; 014-297-924-787-009; 014-555-468-568-070; 016-009-199-086-771; 016-421-756-148-512; 017-708-454-247-712; 019-622-915-734-27X; 020-402-955-219-046; 024-707-431-362-75X; 030-285-119-895-818; 031-021-780-594-409; 032-494-612-708-485; 035-194-097-424-158; 035-997-903-243-204; 045-640-805-432-475; 046-030-741-698-909; 055-809-949-277-308; 060-742-625-567-314; 070-627-444-720-307; 072-510-702-098-13X; 082-851-081-486-92X; 084-365-245-206-306; 087-710-687-877-151; 094-721-062-044-392; 096-766-575-734-788; 097-298-518-714-758; 105-655-508-995-139; 107-278-150-978-888; 109-802-423-459-241; 114-258-050-218-641; 115-606-139-771-296; 124-407-129-963-803; 139-415-829-754-564; 141-005-140-982-524; 147-439-017-287-143; 158-198-234-615-259; 164-680-187-824-236; 179-517-966-221-279; 195-618-519-387-640,43

Pywell; W. R. Meek; Lucy Hulmes; S. Hulmes; Katy L. James; Marek Nowakowski; Claire Carvell,"There have been serious global declines in diversity of bumblebees, butterflies and other pollinating insects. The most effective means of increasing abundance and diversity of bumblebees on farmland is to sow simple, low cost mixtures of dicotyledons rich in pollen and nectar, as prescribed under the UK agri-environment schemes. The potential benefits of this management prescription for butterflies are unknown. Similarly, more information is needed on how to manage this habitat to maximise the provision of pollen and nectar resources whilst protecting breeding habitat for butterflies. This study aimed to devise mixtures and cutting management regimes which address these issues. We found significant effects of seed mixture, timing and frequency of cutting, and removal of cut material on vegetation composition, flower resource availability and pollinators (the abundance, species richness and temporal distribution of butterflies and bumblebees, including males and queens, attracted to the mixtures). We recommend that nectar flower mixtures are refined by the inclusion of the best performing species to provide mid- and late-season forage resources (Trifolium spp., Lotus corniculatus and Centaurea nigra), and the removal of competitive grass species. Summer cutting in May or early June, with removal of herbage where possible, should be applied to half the patch to extend the flowering season, and minimise damage to butterfly breeding habitat. This should be accompanied by the typical autumn cut to the whole patch. Even with best management practice, such nectar flower mixtures are only effective for 3–4 years and this should be recognised in policies aimed at enhancing pollinator populations in agricultural landscapes.",15,6,853,864,Pollinator; Forage (honey bee); Nectar source; Nectar; Pollination; Ecology; Pollen; Animal ecology; Species richness; Biology,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/384321 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10841-011-9383-x/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10841-011-9383-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-011-9383-x,,10.1007/s10841-011-9383-x,2069763963,,0,003-460-280-575-85X; 009-361-087-991-944; 010-290-657-368-370; 018-869-298-005-300; 031-862-039-493-29X; 034-980-495-883-757; 043-603-397-145-69X; 044-445-829-636-966; 062-948-664-034-066; 064-643-492-079-06X; 069-311-865-481-90X; 071-245-262-326-969; 071-363-274-178-219; 071-788-913-219-288; 079-068-774-342-74X; 079-492-501-193-26X; 085-507-496-811-84X; 094-506-716-348-263; 106-138-748-871-574; 114-480-653-531-829; 120-524-273-028-868; 144-915-982-059-308; 151-882-271-366-809; 160-354-146-181-044,85

Results showed that sown grass strips were high quality habitats for grasshoppers compared to grasslands. Farming practices influenced grasshopper densities in sown grass strips while landscape context affected more the species richness of grasshoppers. Sown mixture and cutting export option were the main factors driving grasshopper density. Mixtures composed of grasses without legumes were the best, as well as hay export compared to no export. Increased grasshopper species richness occurred in sown grass strips located in landscapes with low grassland field availability and high connectivity. Enhanced use of sown grass strips by grasshoppers can be seen as a direct effect of establishment and management options, but also as an effect of the rarity and instability of other grassland habitats in agricultural landscapes.",159,,105,111,Hay; Agriculture; Habitat; Grassland; Acrididae; Grasshopper; Context (language use); Species richness; Agroforestry; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00714365 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/436882 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880912002435 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167880912002435,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2012.06.017,,10.1016/j.agee.2012.06.017,2095906203,,0,003-251-732-418-644; 006-285-430-699-043; 012-357-805-545-268; 013-088-014-679-212; 016-421-756-148-512; 026-527-744-858-38X; 031-796-403-225-855; 040-253-713-116-916; 043-009-269-441-396; 047-946-954-821-823; 053-710-838-701-96X; 054-715-078-148-813; 055-946-607-021-418; 059-804-606-271-839; 060-679-385-902-62X; 062-218-780-389-812; 068-452-604-669-157; 071-427-724-923-336; 079-615-024-387-738; 080-568-587-872-709; 083-381-011-024-36X; 083-525-115-003-950; 097-092-295-500-651; 101-467-474-763-36X; 102-362-526-374-610; 102-682-387-421-626; 105-065-409-527-284; 137-802-632-043-010; 142-677-383-560-199; 145-523-815-049-35X; 155-691-175-864-748; 161-300-804-429-199; 167-175-414-731-307; 176-314-956-781-732,22

K. Griffiths; C. F. George Thomas,"Summary; ; The distribution of the carabid beetle Nebria brevicollis was monitored in the summer during a period of declining activity associated with aestivation in a hedgerow. After emergence from aestivation, population density, distribution and dispersal of N. brevicollis were studied during autumn 1994 in a mark-recapture experiment. 3560 beetles were marked and 1887 were recaptured in a grid of pitfall traps spanning a hedgerow and extending approximately 32 m either side into two recently harvested cereal fields. Population size, estimated from a Lincoln index, increased slightly with time with a mean population density of approximately 0.9 beetles m−2. Activity-density varied during the experiment and was significantly related to maximum temperature. The population was aggregated within the hedgerow during aestivation and in several spatially stable hot-spots of activity-density within the field during autumn. There was considerable movement within fields but the hedgerow was a significant barrier to dispersal between fields, with potential effects on the metapopulation structure of the species.",137,2,89,97,Aestivation; Population size; Ecology; Metapopulation; Population density; Spatial distribution; Nebria brevicollis; Population; Biological dispersal; Biology,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-7348.2000.tb00040.x https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20013033090,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7348.2000.tb00040.x,,10.1111/j.1744-7348.2000.tb00040.x,1996210929,,0,009-764-623-709-428; 010-888-549-334-33X; 010-945-646-716-071; 011-335-007-918-978; 013-963-655-119-437; 014-809-297-009-430; 015-745-674-744-948; 021-239-653-544-045; 022-070-333-305-083; 029-317-185-823-896; 033-622-591-677-498; 036-171-649-939-905; 036-703-393-537-72X; 037-241-390-682-529; 037-325-128-567-400; 038-100-698-630-781; 043-329-639-022-790; 044-050-646-677-718; 046-117-070-832-020; 046-457-009-481-605; 055-083-398-263-398; 058-105-561-757-413; 058-743-931-737-265; 060-626-812-234-007; 068-692-244-077-897; 072-817-046-222-302; 075-004-045-803-974; 077-294-162-803-894; 080-139-567-968-521; 082-141-530-704-392; 086-653-164-596-188; 087-186-786-234-321; 089-319-960-175-208; 096-974-408-461-061; 109-985-350-846-498; 123-653-571-393-994; 136-976-332-375-885; 137-469-370-566-033; 139-933-757-575-486; 142-547-556-180-595; 175-716-493-242-497; 179-135-692-517-713; 179-288-512-643-091; 194-482-255-430-935,36

Pomeroy; Xing Fang,"On the Canadian Prairies and the northern US Great Plains, snow is an important component of annual precipitation, sometimes constituting over 40% of the total, although there is much annual and regional variability. Much of this snow is transported by wind, causing substantial sublimation losses, which are reduced by obstacles and topographic features on the landscape that reduce snow transport and trap snow. Agroforestry configurations trap snow and reduce the amount and distance of snow movement and, because of this, reduce the amount of moisture lost to sublimation. The planning of agroforestry measures should therefore take into account their effects on snow hydrology. In this study, the effects of shelterbelts on snow quantity and distribution are shown over multiple years, including a number of locations in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Results show that snow transport reached equilibrium in 400 m or less (i.e., that sublimation rates were at their maximum beyond 400 m leeward of a shelterbelt). Also, in a paired landscape inventory, the landscape with shelterbelts had 29% more snow water equivalent (SWE) than the unsheltered landscape. Site-specific meteorological data was used in the Prairie Blowing Snow Model, now a component of the Cold Regions Hydrological Model, to calculate the effects of agroforestry configurations on snow water conservation. Modeled snow distribution agreed well with measured snow at Conquest, Saskatchewan, in the winter of 2009/2010. Using actual weather data for the same location for the period 1996–2011, the model calculated the annual sublimation from 200 m wide fields protected by shelterbelts to be up to 12.5 mm less than similar unsheltered fields.",86,3,335,344,Water conservation; Windbreak; Moisture; Snow; Snow hydrology; Environmental science; Sublimation (phase transition); Blowing snow; Snow field; Atmospheric sciences,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10457-011-9466-4.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/103812565 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-011-9466-4 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-011-9466-4/fulltext.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-011-9466-4,,10.1007/s10457-011-9466-4,1972066109,,0,002-466-962-536-728; 014-982-658-905-919; 019-510-249-119-593; 022-648-804-684-488; 048-792-005-843-526; 053-014-710-807-301; 114-397-354-649-416; 116-163-639-330-522; 117-073-520-190-515; 128-297-520-800-75X; 162-956-431-308-084; 173-260-512-862-638,22

109-621-473-204-594,Enhanced Transpiration by Riparian Buffer Trees in Response to Advection in a Humid Temperate Agricultural Landscape,,2011,journal article,Forest Ecology and Management,03781127,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Virginia Hernandez-Santana; Heidi Asbjornsen; Thomas J. Sauer; Thomas M. Isenhart; Keith E. Schilling; Richard C. Schultz,"Riparian buffers are designed as management practices to increase infiltration and reduce surface runoff and transport of sediment and nonpoint source pollutants from crop fields to adjacent streams. Achieving these ecosystem service goals depends, in part, on their ability to remove water from the soil via transpiration. In these systems, edges between crop fields and trees of the buffer systems can create advection processes, which could influence water use by trees. We conducted a field study in a riparian buffer system established in 1994 under a humid temperate climate, located in the Corn Belt region of the Midwestern U.S. (Iowa). The goals were to estimate stand level transpiration by the riparian buffer, quantify the controls on water use by the buffer system, and determine to what extent advective energy and tree position within the buffer system influence individual tree transpiration rates. We primarily focused on the water use response (determined with the Heat Ratio Method) of one of the dominant species (Acer saccharinum) and a subdominant (Juglans nigra). A few individuals of three additional species (Quercus bicolor, Betula nigra, Platanus occidentalis) were monitored over a shorter time period to assess the generality of responses. Meteorological stations were installed along a transect across the riparian buffer to determine the microclimate conditions. The differences found among individuals were attributed to differences in species sap velocities and sapwood depths, location relative to the forest edge and prevailing winds and canopy exposure and dominance. Sapflow rates for A. saccharinum trees growing at the SE edge (prevailing winds) were 39% greater than SE interior trees and 30% and 69% greater than NW interior and edge trees, respectively. No transpiration enhancement due to edge effect was detected in the subdominant J. nigra. The results were interpreted as indicative of advection effects from the surrounding crops. Further, significant differences were document in sapflow rates between the five study species, suggesting that selection of species is important for enhancing specific riparian buffer functions. However, more information is needed on water use patterns among diverse species growing under different climatic and biophysical conditions to assist policy and management decisions regarding effective buffer design.",261,8,1415,1427,Canopy; Riparian zone; Transpiration; Ecology; Riparian buffer; Buffer zone; Microclimate; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Forest ecology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112711000594 https://works.bepress.com/richard_schultz/12/ https://works.bepress.com/richard_schultz/12/download/ https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/nrem_pubs/176/ https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70035028 http://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND44504906 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1174&context=nrem_pubs https://core.ac.uk/display/38936471 https://core.ac.uk/download/38936471.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2011.01.027,,10.1016/j.foreco.2011.01.027,1973003639,,0,000-933-635-218-121; 002-937-270-631-538; 004-905-391-095-299; 006-013-126-848-359; 006-301-725-524-643; 007-782-284-974-556; 007-868-997-910-082; 008-963-601-245-963; 009-550-464-053-244; 010-016-985-053-464; 014-505-740-285-710; 014-675-797-942-445; 014-869-190-986-412; 015-774-018-873-947; 015-797-434-263-656; 015-853-406-515-960; 016-820-609-156-975; 018-849-605-190-692; 019-660-983-218-24X; 028-802-252-344-012; 032-567-117-266-899; 034-438-015-172-199; 035-252-962-089-458; 036-737-756-097-520; 036-902-840-704-756; 036-972-669-332-991; 042-198-513-831-839; 044-401-317-828-273; 044-648-632-949-459; 044-913-271-610-875; 048-438-815-490-855; 048-614-212-390-003; 053-039-894-599-842; 055-845-490-503-700; 055-850-639-312-512; 056-228-092-536-366; 057-218-444-292-48X; 058-246-587-603-761; 064-239-686-824-334; 067-407-178-194-654; 069-617-966-938-050; 072-782-039-741-14X; 073-304-044-398-243; 084-835-163-576-171; 093-473-218-476-962; 096-486-715-261-497; 096-992-699-821-977; 098-872-995-549-580; 100-557-736-418-383; 101-213-200-736-866; 104-372-109-775-140; 105-776-211-113-888; 106-610-194-124-767; 108-578-084-648-864; 114-338-848-181-040; 115-642-860-718-878; 120-541-822-032-89X; 125-114-523-881-459; 126-961-510-728-424; 127-162-591-317-082; 127-873-912-506-88X; 128-446-648-309-608; 132-453-594-121-799; 134-015-929-541-174; 139-935-842-194-740; 142-178-368-818-650; 142-271-391-381-035; 142-443-085-420-962; 145-247-954-968-606; 149-362-419-662-110; 157-041-797-285-853; 166-206-159-722-288; 171-323-632-774-790; 178-282-643-794-654; 186-757-319-875-934; 190-556-196-451-472; 195-401-611-860-018; 196-532-707-381-19X,32

The midwestern United States is characterized by many kilometers of narrow, naturally occurring forests along streams. However, little is known about the relative effectiveness of these remnant forests compared with these newly established buffers. This study compared the ability of naturally occurring remnant forests with and without adjacent planted grass filters to buffer concentrated flow paths (CFPs) originating in crop fields along first- and second-order streams in three northeast Missouri watersheds. Remnant forests breached by runoff through CFPs were narrower than those that dispersed 100% of the CFPs. Remnant forests with adjacent grass buffers were nearly twice the width as those without grass filters. We also found that CFPs, which developed within remnant forests and at the base of in-field grass waterways, were potential sources of sediments to streams. Methods to mitigate these CFPs warrant further investigation. Our study suggests that although these natural remnant forests provide substantial buffering capacity, both improved management and/or the addition of an adjacent grass filter would improve water quality by reducing sediment loss to streams. Inferences can be used to inform the design and management of similar conservation buffer systems within the region.",46,2,311,322,Erosion; Riparian forest; Water resources; Nonpoint source pollution; Water quality; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; STREAMS; Surface runoff,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103134095.html https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2010.00422.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2010.00422.x/abstract https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103134095 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010JAWRA..46..311K/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2010.00422.x,,10.1111/j.1752-1688.2010.00422.x,2016256893,,0,000-933-635-218-121; 003-148-094-786-550; 004-274-424-425-410; 023-683-277-287-21X; 025-131-472-929-81X; 028-802-252-344-012; 030-682-084-703-597; 033-842-747-228-686; 036-466-585-417-013; 044-401-317-828-273; 044-948-727-495-773; 045-814-903-083-739; 048-513-319-982-524; 053-514-836-557-388; 059-949-847-321-259; 066-360-222-781-695; 067-656-049-341-942; 076-826-572-086-275; 080-812-176-152-098; 082-797-391-654-568; 083-619-701-060-090; 088-236-621-248-724; 101-774-056-400-814; 103-231-338-453-473; 104-207-444-130-180; 108-578-084-648-864; 111-288-588-656-115; 115-642-860-718-878; 127-438-641-898-095; 128-195-997-346-382; 131-964-178-587-619; 158-517-969-155-228; 188-800-463-494-363,34

Cullum; Glenn V. Wilson; K. C. McGregor; J. R. Johnson,"Abstract Grass hedges and no-till cropping systems reduced soil losses on standard erosion plots in ultra-narrow row (20 cm) cotton during a 4-year study (1999–2002). No-till cotton with grass hedges, no-till cotton without grass hedges, conventional-till cotton with grass hedges, and conventional-till cotton without grass hedges produced 4-year average annual soil losses of 1.8, 2.9, 4.0, and 30.8 t ha −1 , respectively, and produced 4-year average runoff amounts of 267, 245, 353, and 585 mm, respectively. The annual ratio of soil loss for no-till ultra-narrow row cotton plots with grass hedges to those without hedges averaged 0.62. The annual ratio of soil loss for conventional-till plots with grass hedges to without hedges was 0.13. Averaged over all plots (with and without grass hedges), no-till plots had 86% less soil loss than conventional-till plots. No-till plots without grass hedges had 90% less soil loss than conventional-till plots without grass hedges. Grass hedges effectively reduced soil loss on erosion plots with similar cropping practices as compared to plots without hedges. Along with the reduced soil losses from no-till system as compared to conventional-till system, the no-till ultra-narrow row cotton system resulted in an average 0.2 t ha −1 yield increase as compared to the conventional-till system. Reduced soil loss and increased crop yield are both positive factors that the user should consider when adopting this cotton system. Other studies of contoured grass hedges on field-sized areas are being conducted to determine their applicability on larger areas with greater concentrations of runoff.",93,1,56,63,Erosion; Crop yield; Fiber crop; Malvaceae; Erosion control; Soil loss; Mathematics; Poaceae; Surface runoff; Agronomy,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167198706000687 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/15677,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2006.03.010,,10.1016/j.still.2006.03.010,2026591845,,0,049-203-816-619-243; 055-873-833-854-552; 086-213-236-252-052; 086-812-760-777-597; 132-949-723-939-343; 145-628-223-693-935; 164-702-330-976-043,30

C. Pankau; Jon E. Schoonover; Karl W. J. Williard; Pamela J. Edwards,"Riparian buffers in agricultural landscapes should be designed to trap pollutants in overland flow by slowing, filtering, and infiltrating surface runoff entering the buffer via sheet flow. However, observational evidence suggests that concentrated flow is prevalent from agricultural fields. Over time sediment can accumulate in riparian buffers forming berms that restrict sheet flow; these berms ultimately back up surface runoff, resulting in an eventual breakthrough that concentrates overland flow. This study examines the occurrence of concentrated flow paths (CFPs) in riparian buffers at both the field and watershed scale. At the field scale, intensive topographic surveys were conducted at ten field sites in southern Illinois. To assess the prevalence of CFPs at the watershed scale, three watersheds in southern Illinois were selected for walking stream surveys along randomly selected 1,000 m reaches. CFPs were identified in all topographic surveys and all walking stream surveys. Among field sites, concentrated flow accounted for 82.5–100% of the drainage leaving the agricultural fields. Sediment berm accumulation was identified at all field sites and was positively correlated with CFP size. At the watershed scale, CFPs were more abundant in agricultural areas compared to forested land. Results from this study indicate that concentrated flow was prevalent across all study sites at both the field and watershed scale. Thus, surface water quality may suffer in areas with poorly functioning buffers, and managers must consider the occurrence of CFPs when designing and maintaining riparian buffers to protect stream water quality.",84,2,191,205,Riparian zone; Erosion; Berm; Nonpoint source pollution; Ecology; Riparian buffer; Water quality; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-011-9457-5/fulltext.html https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-011-9457-5 https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/concentrated-flow-paths-in-riparian-buffer-zones-of-southern-illi https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/theses/212/ http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1255&context=usdafsfacpub https://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/54207 https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1219&context=theses https://www.fs.fed.us/nrs/pubs/jrnl/2012/nrs_2012_pankau_001.pdf https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/54207 https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usdafsfacpub/256/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-011-9457-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-011-9457-5,,10.1007/s10457-011-9457-5,2049779240,,0,003-148-094-786-550; 013-639-110-556-018; 015-514-563-181-208; 028-802-252-344-012; 038-659-320-814-260; 040-007-277-856-198; 042-325-649-272-22X; 044-401-317-828-273; 044-982-906-041-039; 045-790-378-121-78X; 059-381-194-377-394; 061-926-792-575-71X; 063-521-010-406-506; 076-826-572-086-275; 079-196-971-304-319; 082-797-391-654-568; 087-168-688-204-963; 097-054-825-053-530; 098-004-631-148-428; 101-774-056-400-814; 103-231-338-453-473; 109-546-072-677-617; 109-858-282-831-697; 110-331-222-074-203; 111-288-588-656-115; 111-435-647-398-863; 115-642-860-718-878; 115-864-182-852-341; 128-195-997-346-382; 154-978-657-665-321; 158-517-969-155-228; 164-215-466-205-24X; 171-831-215-685-94X; 183-033-307-001-620; 183-143-735-590-924; 191-359-559-824-869,29

Clews; Stephen James Ormerod,"1.; Agriculture, urbanization or forestry in river catchments can influence river organisms through diffuse effects on hydrology and hydrochemistry, or local effects on habitat character, bank erosion and sediment delivery. Riparian buffer zones are sometimes established to mitigate undesirable effects on salmonids, but consequences for organisms such as macroinvertebrates are less well known.; ; 2.; Riparian fencing and tree coppicing were carried out on upland tributaries of the Welsh River Wye (UK) from 1997 onwards with the aim of enhancing conditions for salmonid fish. The present study used routine, agency monitoring data to compare assemblages in three recently managed streams and five adjacent control streams. Data between 1995 and 2004 were used to assess treatment effects through time.; ; 3.; Post-treatment (2000–2004) assemblages were richer in recently managed streams than in controls, mostly due to apparent gains of taxa typical of channel margins and lowland, warmer conditions. However, results were equivocal because invertebrate families typical of lowland, more eutrophic conditions increased in occurrence in all reaches irrespective of treatment, while overall richness declined.; ; 4.; This study illustrates how routine monitoring data can reveal some effects of riparian land-use and management on stream biota. However, improved experimental design, ideally using a before–after control–intervention approach, would have allowed more effective assessment in this case study where confounding trends were so marked. We advocate using such approaches in future restoration studies to allow stronger inference and greater statistical power. The recent general decline in the richness of typical headwater organisms in the Wye system requires investigation.

Westbury; S.G. Potts; S.J. Harris; V.K. Brown,"This study investigates the function of non-cropped field margins in arable farming systems for enhancing the biodiversity value of beetle communities. Three different sown seed mixtures were used to establish field margins, a Countryside Stewardship mix, a fine grass and forbs mix and a tussock grass and forbs mix. The structure of beetle communities in the first full year of establishment was found to show no difference between the tussock grass and Countryside Stewardship margins. However, both differed from the fine grass margins, which supported lower overall abundance and species richness of beetles. This was attributed to small-scale architectural differences between species of fine and tussock grasses, rather than differences in plant composition. Body size distributions of beetles showed distinct similarities between the Countryside Stewardship and tussock margins. A greater abundance of large beetles was found in fine grass margins, although in all cases these body size distributions were attributed to a small number of species or a taxonomically distinct group. All three margin types included beetle species of conservation value. The importance of these results was discussed in the context of the value of these seed mixtures for invertebrate conversation.

110-684-291-574-379,"Effects of newly planted hedges on ground-beetle diversity (Coleoptera, Carabidae) in an agricultural landscape",,1999,journal article,Ecography,09067590; 16000587,Wiley,United Kingdom,Elisabeth Fournier; Michel Loreau,"The diversity of ground-beetle communities (Coleoptera, Carabidae) was studied to assess the short-term impact of new hedges planted in an intensive agro-ecosystem. Hedges represent a new and undisturbed habitat for those polyphagous predators and may provide increased prey availability. Carabids were sampled with pitfall traps in a hedge and an adjacent cultivated field during the whole activity period of these insects to assess the effect of distance from the hedge on species diversity. Fenced pitfall traps were also used to estimate absolute population densities. Several diversity indices were calculated at various sampling levels (total area, distance treatment, trap). Kendall's coefficient of rank correlation between communities at adjacent distances showed that the greatest changes in species relative abundances occurred close to the hedge. Indices of species richness, dominance concentration, equitability and Fisher's a all indicated a significant decrease in species diversity with increasing distance from the hedge. These trends are explained by two complementary factors. First, the number of species decreased significantly with distance from the centre of the hedge. Second, the various species had different spatial patterns of total capture and absolute density. Four groups of species can thus be distinguished: species restricted to the hedge, species preferring the hedge, species preferring the crop, and species unaffected by the hedge.

G. Mueller; Todd Kellerman; Matthew J. Helmers; Eduardo Rienzi,"Spatially nonuniform runoff reduces the water quality performance of constant-width filter strips. A geographic information system (GIS)-based tool was developed and tested that employs terrain analysis to account for spatially nonuniform runoff and produce more effective filter strip designs. The computer program, AgBufferBuilder, runs with ArcGIS versions 10.0 and 10.1 (Esri, Redlands, California) and uses digital elevation models to identify detailed spatial patterns of overland runoff to field margins. The tool then sizes filter dimensions according to those patterns using buffer area ratio relationships. The resulting design is larger along segments where more runoff flows and smaller along segments where runoff is less and delivers a constant level of trapping efficiency around the field margin for sediment and sediment-bound pollutants. The tool also can estimate trapping efficiency of existing filter strips or hypothetical configurations. In a validation test, estimates of sediment trapping efficiency using the tool9s assessment function compared closely to measurements taken on large field plots in central Iowa. Using AgBufferBuilder, designs developed for a sample of fields in the midwestern United States were estimated to trap nearly double the sediment, on average, during a design storm than constant-width configurations having equivalent total filter area. AgBufferBuilder can be used to bolster environmental performance of filter strips where runoff is spatially nonuniform.

J. Schmitt; M. G. Dosskey; K. D. Hoagland,"Filter strips are widely prescribed to reduce contaminants in surface runoff from agricultural fields. This study compared performance of different filter strip designs on several contaminants and evaluated the contributing processes. Different vegetation types and widths were investigated using simulated runoff event on large plots (3 m × 7.5 or 15 m) having fine-textured soil and a 6 to 7% slope. Filter strips 7.5 and 15 m wide downslope greatly reduced concentrations of sediment in runoff (76-93%) and contaminants strongly associated with sediment (total P, 55-79%; permethrin, 27-83% 1(3-phenoxyphenyl) methyl (±)-cis,trans-3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate]). They had less effect on concentrations of primarily dissolved contaminants [atrazine, -5-43% (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine); alachlor, 10-61% [2-chloro-2'6'-diethyl-N-(methoxymethyl) acetanilide]; nitrate, 24-48%; dissolved P, 19-43%; bromide, 13-31%]. Dilution of runoff by rainfall accounted for most of the reduction of concentration of dissolved contaminants. Infiltration (36-82% of runoff volume) substantially reduced the mass of contaminants exiting the filter strips. Doubling filter strip width from 7.5 to 15 m doubled infiltration and dilution, but did not improve sediment settling. Young trees and shrubs planted in the lower one-half of otherwise grass strips had no impact on filter performance. Compared with cultivated sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] grass clearly reduced concentrations of sediment and associated contaminants in runoff, but not volume of runoff and concentration of dissolved contaminants. Settling, infiltration, and dilution processes can explain performance differences among pollutant types and filter strip designs.",28,5,1479,1489,Environmental chemistry; Infiltration (hydrology); Settling; Filter strip; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; Biofilter; Surface runoff; Water pollution; Dilution,,,,,http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/natrespapers/735/ https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/28/5/JEQ0280051479 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq1999.00472425002800050013x https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1742&context=natrespapers https://core.ac.uk/download/189484489.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1999.00472425002800050013x,,10.2134/jeq1999.00472425002800050013x,2050752448,,0,000-420-455-789-45X; 014-561-967-561-763; 034-748-846-517-673; 045-573-628-287-109; 052-894-240-545-387; 070-877-956-179-122; 073-564-601-864-691; 076-826-572-086-275; 082-797-391-654-568; 086-190-138-130-44X; 097-972-089-803-438; 102-307-069-255-349; 103-286-115-762-912; 109-376-461-877-242; 111-299-180-503-936; 113-496-738-919-590; 131-585-819-964-761; 141-101-347-131-583,295

Broughton; Richard F. Shore; Matthew S. Heard; Sam R. Amy; W. R. Meek; John W. Redhead; A. Turk; Richard F. Pywell,"Abstract The decline of farmland biodiversity over much of Europe has been largely attributed to agricultural intensification. Since the 1970s, governments have introduced agri-environment schemes (AES) aimed at mitigating this impact, but information on their success is limited. A five y, farm-scale experiment was conducted to test the efficacy of England's Environmental Stewardship AES in enhancing the species richness and abundance of small mammals (voles Cricetidae , mice Muridae , and shrews Soricidae ) in an intensively-farmed arable landscape. Small mammal communities were sampled in spring and autumn on grassy field margins installed under the Entry Level Scheme (ELS) tier of Environmental Stewardship, where 1% of cropped land was converted to wildlife habitats. Results were compared with those from field margins on a second, experimental treatment (ELS Extra: ELSX) in which 5% of cropped land was taken out of production, and also field margins on a conventionally-farmed control treatment (‘cross compliance’: CC). Species richness and abundance of small mammals showed a significant increase on all treatments in spring and autumn. Many increases were greater on ELS and ELSX field margins compared to the CC controls, but there was little evidence that ELSX was more beneficial than ELS, and there were species-specific differences. Voles were not detected on any treatment in the initial sampling period but bank voles Myodes glareolus rapidly became abundant thereafter, particularly on ELS and ELSX field margins, and field voles Microtus agrestis also colonised. Wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus were present on all treatments in all sampling periods, but spring abundance declined as vole abundance increased. These results suggest that the Entry Level Scheme tier of the English agri-environment scheme is effective in enhancing small mammal communities on arable farmland, with potential benefits for higher trophic levels via their predators.",192,,122,129,Biodiversity; Ecology; Vole; Apodemus; Microtus; Species richness; Arable land; Trophic level; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/20319912 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880914002060 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880914002060 https://core.ac.uk/download/20319912.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2014.04.009,,10.1016/j.agee.2014.04.009,1976175545,,0,000-354-603-611-440; 003-460-280-575-85X; 003-519-773-389-573; 022-101-299-722-48X; 031-862-039-493-29X; 035-051-432-999-701; 036-164-148-520-238; 037-883-795-788-801; 038-618-402-954-434; 038-778-276-441-760; 044-307-871-990-779; 054-676-518-243-912; 056-099-523-856-735; 064-643-064-473-458; 065-346-869-208-139; 066-882-160-758-008; 071-192-821-815-608; 076-240-724-493-462; 090-842-423-313-371; 095-014-169-963-827; 095-877-317-702-391; 103-004-360-139-077; 119-352-383-206-342; 124-319-214-482-940; 125-357-678-676-499; 126-655-235-523-604; 144-700-882-404-647; 148-789-623-443-683; 150-083-888-912-972; 150-325-162-873-23X; 151-923-371-813-918; 155-005-615-444-518; 159-938-497-832-818; 167-728-003-906-501; 169-297-520-424-667; 182-282-925-411-943,59

McMillan,"Recent research indicates that riparian zones have the potential to contribute significant amounts of greenhouse gases (GHG: N2O, CO2, CH4) to the atmosphere. Yet, the short-term spatial and temporal variability in GHG emission in these systems is poorly understood. Using two transects of three static chambers at two North Carolina agricultural riparian zones (one restored, one unrestored), we show that estimates of the average GHG flux at the site scale can vary by one order of magnitude depending on whether the mean or the median is used as a measure of central tendency. Because the median tends to mute the effect of outlier points (hot spots and hot moments), we propose that both must be reported or that other more advanced spatial averaging techniques (e.g., kriging, area-weighted average) should be used to estimate GHG fluxes at the site scale. Results also indicate that short-term temporal variability in GHG fluxes (a few days) under seemingly constant temperature and hydrological conditions can be as large as spatial variability at the site scale, suggesting that the scientific community should rethink sampling protocols for GHG at the soil-atmosphere interface to include repeated measures over short periods of time at select chambers to estimate GHG emissions in the field. Although recent advances in technology provide tools to address these challenges, their cost is often too high for widespread implementation. Until technology improves, sampling design strategies will need to be carefully considered to balance cost, time, and spatial and temporal representativeness of measurements.",187,8,503,503,Riparian zone; Greenhouse effect; Hydrology; Environmental science; Greenhouse gas; Environmental monitoring; Sampling design; Kriging; Sampling (statistics); Atmospheric sciences; Spatial variability,,Agriculture/statistics & numerical data; Carbon Dioxide/analysis; Environmental Monitoring/methods; Gases/analysis; Greenhouse Effect; Methane/analysis; Nitrous Oxide/analysis; North Carolina; Rivers; Soil,Gases; Soil; Carbon Dioxide; Nitrous Oxide; Methane,,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153324053 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26169979 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26169979 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10661-015-4717-x?view=classic https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10661-015-4717-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4717-x,26169979,10.1007/s10661-015-4717-x,2235645759,,0,003-451-422-132-663; 015-008-874-237-705; 016-712-968-505-016; 020-297-978-713-619; 030-487-582-317-644; 031-205-549-990-210; 035-100-373-827-376; 035-778-104-963-002; 036-232-925-427-161; 045-020-182-383-672; 046-292-313-541-673; 055-347-919-455-640; 056-632-986-533-687; 060-139-646-563-121; 073-865-623-324-417; 085-080-272-017-495; 091-875-218-650-907; 110-588-214-484-417; 142-906-126-422-445; 169-993-554-881-216; 176-785-973-569-670,15

Southway; Barbara Smith,"Abstract The impact of two predatory guilds, epigeal and aerial natural enemies, on levels of cereal aphid control in winter wheat was examined on farms with contrasting proportions of grass margins, one of the most popular agri-environment options in England. In year 1, by 14 d after inoculation the aerial natural enemies alone had caused substantial reductions (88%) in numbers of cereal aphids compared to where no natural enemies were present. In contrast, epigeal predators achieved a 31% reduction, although this reached 88% after 28 d. In year 2, both aerial and epigeal natural enemies achieved over 87% control after 14 d. Aerial natural enemies were largely comprised of predatory Diptera and Linyphiidae (Araneae). Levels of control were positively related to the proportion of linear grass margins within 250, 500 and 750 m radii of the study arenas. There was weaker evidence that hedgerows decreased aphid control by epigeal predators.

The afforestation of these riparian zones has the potential to increase carbon (C) storage in agricultural landscapes by creating a new biomass sink for atmospheric CO2. Occurring at the same time, the storage of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in plant biomass, is an important water quality function that may greatly vary with types of riparian vegetation. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare C, N and P storage in aboveground, belowground and detrital biomass for three types of riparian vegetation cover (9-year-old hybrid poplar buffers, herbaceous buffers and natural woodlots) across four agricultural sites and (2) to determine potential vegetation cover effects on soil nutrient supply rate in the riparian zone. Site level comparisons suggest that 9-year-old poplar buffers have stored 9e31 times more biomass C, 4e10 times more biomass N, and 3e7 times more biomass P than adjacent non managed herbaceous buffers, with the largest differences observed on the more fertile sites. The conversion of these herbaceous buffers to poplar buffers could respectively increase C, N and P storage in biomass by 3.2e11.9 t/ha/yr, 32e124 kg/ ha/yr and 3.2e15.6 kg/ha/yr, over 9 years. Soil NO3 and P supply rates during the summer were respectively 57% and 66% lower in poplar buffers than in adjacent herbaceous buffers, potentially reflecting differences in nutrient storage and cycling between the two buffer types. Biomass C ranged 49 e160 t/ha in woodlots, 33e110 t/ha in poplar buffers and 3e4 t/ha in herbaceous buffers. Similar biomass C stocks were found in the most productive poplar buffer and three of the four woodlots studied. Given their large and varied biomass C stocks, conservation of older riparian woodlots is equally important for C balance management in farmland. In addition, the establishment of poplar buffers, in replacement of non managed herbaceous buffers, could rapidly increase biomass C, N and P storage along farm streams, which would be beneficial for water quality protection and global change mitigation. © 2015 The Authors.

Aguiar; K. Rasera; L. M. Parron; António G. Brito; Maria Teresa Ferreira,"Abstract Riparian buffer zones have the potential to capture chemical contaminants and to mitigate detrimental side-effects in aquatic ecosystems derived from excess fertilizers used in agro-food production. No-till farming systems are well known agricultural practices and are widely used in temperate areas. In that regard, different settings and widths of riparian buffer zones (12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 m) with woody vegetation, shrubs or grasses were assessed. The methodology was comprised of the evaluation of a large number of experimental sites and the sampling was conducted after the first rain period and respective fertilizer applications. The results point to the fact that effectiveness is largely controlled by buffer zone width and vegetation type.

Evans; Manuel Plantegenest,"The ecosystem service of insect pest regulation by natural enemies, such as primary parasitoids, may be enhanced by the presence of uncultivated, semi-natural habitats within agro-ecosystems, although quantifying such host–parasitoid interactions is difficult. Here, we use rRNA 16S gene sequencing to assess both the level of parasitism by Aphidiinae primary parasitoids and parasitoid identity on a large sample of aphids collected in cultivated and uncultivated agricultural habitats in Western France. We used these data to construct ecological networks to assess the level of compartmentalization between aphid and parasitoid food webs of cultivated and uncultivated habitats. We evaluated the extent to which uncultivated margins provided a resource for parasitoids shared between pest and nonpest aphids. We compared the observed quantitative ecological network described by our molecular approach to an empirical qualitative network based on aphid–parasitoid interactions from traditional rearing data found in the literature. We found that the molecular network was highly compartmentalized and that parasitoid sharing is relatively rare between aphids, especially between crop and noncrop compartments. Moreover, the few cases of putative shared generalist parasitoids were questionable and could be due to the lack of discrimination of cryptic species or from intraspecific host specialization. Our results suggest that apparent competition mediated by Aphidiinae parasitoids is probably rare in agricultural areas and that the contribution of field margins as a source of these biocontrol agents is much more limited than expected. Further large-scale (spatial and temporal) studies on other crops and noncrop habitats are needed to confirm this.",23,15,3900,3911,Biological pest control; Intraspecific competition; Ecology; Aphid; Aphidiinae; Parasitism; Parasitoid; Ecological network; Generalist and specialist species; Biology,16S rRNA; Aphidiinae parasitoids; agroecosystems; apparent competition; food webs; host-parasitoid communities,"Agriculture; Animals; Aphids/parasitology; Competitive Behavior; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Food Chain; France; Hymenoptera; Molecular Sequence Data",,Agence Nationale de la Recherche; Agence Nationale de la Recherche; Conseil Rï¿½gional de Bretagne,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01228834 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612360 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.12701 https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/pub_details2.aspx?pub_id=218604 https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.12701 http://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/pub_details2.aspx?pub_id=218604,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.12701,24612360,10.1111/mec.12701,2137466260,,0,000-359-395-764-700; 000-944-383-330-11X; 001-319-177-005-933; 001-888-651-184-239; 004-408-282-086-003; 004-951-469-878-072; 007-644-796-937-550; 008-301-310-295-925; 010-636-697-985-643; 011-131-884-656-311; 012-609-223-194-996; 014-345-199-493-879; 016-128-882-684-25X; 016-171-133-452-105; 018-454-568-600-691; 019-088-014-447-161; 019-123-430-272-496; 024-742-090-721-040; 025-347-342-323-919; 026-204-829-930-217; 027-766-470-667-686; 032-073-120-881-796; 032-452-486-736-649; 033-582-856-465-252; 034-975-921-711-426; 037-003-998-372-39X; 039-563-915-799-848; 040-245-282-949-990; 040-920-412-427-40X; 041-715-755-351-519; 042-383-174-704-37X; 042-515-612-320-424; 044-052-265-413-654; 047-367-958-846-378; 051-625-778-057-834; 052-399-152-529-557; 052-846-340-107-96X; 056-195-997-407-325; 069-463-174-254-014; 073-313-669-445-585; 074-014-682-778-727; 075-181-569-110-885; 077-532-222-012-842; 082-283-967-400-619; 082-751-881-093-43X; 083-981-160-907-114; 084-184-429-079-521; 091-310-351-165-89X; 093-629-356-753-217; 095-466-051-844-686; 096-336-980-279-299; 100-205-703-102-922; 101-216-165-553-477; 103-918-521-843-50X; 113-084-297-013-521; 116-320-449-624-526; 117-144-821-570-066; 118-895-430-756-14X; 123-803-340-996-633; 128-943-141-042-649; 131-480-068-338-127; 136-833-209-468-463; 137-368-046-571-428; 138-604-554-457-435; 148-413-052-915-580; 150-276-820-464-414; 156-872-951-876-83X; 157-331-964-716-469,50

112-757-349-871-171,Economic evaluation of on‐farm conservation practices in the great lakes region of North America,,1999,journal article,Environmetrics,11804009; 1099095x,Wiley,United States,D. Peter Stonehouse,"Agriculture has long been regarded as a major contributor to wildlife habitat despoliation, soil degradation, and downstream watercourse pollution. It would be possible to largely eliminate natural resource degeneration through judicious application of on-farm conservation practices. Farmers have little economic incentive to conserve because, according to previous research, most conservation techniques have been demonstrated to be unprofitable. The empirical research into three alternative types of conservation practices for this study confirms that two (conservation crops and riparian buffer strips) provide for net costs to farmers, and that the third (conservation soil tillage) is not profitable under all circumstances. At the same time, the research shows that two out of the three sets of practices, namely riparian buffer strips and conservation tillage, can be economically beneficial to society as a whole. This raises the question of whether and to what extent society, as economic gainers, should offer compensation to farmers as economic losers. This study furthermore establishes that not all conservation practices that result in reduced soil erosion will lead to decreased sediment and phosphorus loadings into watercourses; that not all reduced sediment and phosphorus loadings lead to improved water quality; and that, even where an improvement to water quality in chemical, physical, biological and aesthetic terms can be obtained, the costs to society of achieving improvement may exceed the economic benefits. Such outcomes can readily promote disagreements between environmentalists and ecologists on the one hand and socio-economists on the other.

Logsdon; Mark D. Tomer; Michael R. Burkart,"Substantial questions remain about the time required for groundwater nitrate to be reduced below 10 mg L �1 following establishment of vegetated riparian buffers. The objective of this study was to document changes in groundwater nitrate–nitrogen (NO3–N) concentrations that occurred within a few years of planting a riparian buffer. In 2000 and 2001 a buffer was planted adjacent to a first-order stream in the deep loess region of western Iowa with strips of walnut and cottonwood trees, alfalfa and brome grass, and switch grass. Non-parametric statistics showed significant declines in NO3–N concentrations in shallow groundwater following buffer establishment, especially mid 2003 and later. The dissolved oxygen generally was N 5m g L �1 beneath the buffer, and neither NO3–N nor DO changed significantly under a non-buffered control area. These short-term changes in groundwater NO3–N provide evidence that vegetated riparian buffers may yield local water-quality benefits within a few years of planting. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

McCracken,"There is growing evidence that insect pollinators are declining globally and agricultural intensification has been identified as a major cause of this decline. To determine how pollinators utilise different habitats within an intensive grassland landscape, bumblebees and butterflies were monitored across a range of agricultural and semi-natural habitats using standardised transect walks. Few pollinators were recorded in intensively managed arable and grassland fields indicating that such habitats provided poor foraging resources. Hedgerows also yielded few pollinators reflecting the lack of pollen and nectar bearing plant species within hedgerows in this landscape. The highest density of pollinators, and richest pollinator assemblages, were recorded in open scrub, road verges and riparian buffer strips. This was most likely the result of such habitats supporting a diverse array of flowering plant species which in turn provided foraging opportunities for pollinators. These prime pollinator habitats should be managed to ensure that they maintain rich botanical assemblages and thus to ensure a continuous supply of nectar and pollen throughout the season.",26,1,25,28,Pollinator; Nectar; Foraging; Habitat; Ecology; Grassland; Riparian buffer; Flowering plant; Pollen; Biology,,,,,https://pure.sruc.ac.uk/en/publications/safe-guarding-pollinator-populations-in-an-intensive-grassland-la,https://pure.sruc.ac.uk/en/publications/safe-guarding-pollinator-populations-in-an-intensive-grassland-la,,,2184767239,,0,002-133-948-308-90X; 034-564-771-274-518; 037-649-247-809-59X; 062-417-263-153-926; 086-626-249-909-151; 092-256-195-118-777; 095-014-169-963-827; 100-351-107-256-955,0

Scheid; Matthias Schaefer; Teja Tscharntke; Carsten Thies,"Summary; 1.  The structural complexity of agricultural landscapes influences the local biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Hence, developing effective biodiversity management requires a better understanding of the relative importance of local and landscape changes, especially for functionally important organisms such as hoverflies benefiting from flowering plants.; ; 2.  We examined hoverfly (Diptera: Syrphidae) communities in broad and narrow sown flower strips, in naturally developed grassy strips and in wheat fields (as a control). We also investigated the effects of these four habitat types on syrphid occurrence in the adjacent wheat fields.; ; 3.  The relative influence of local vs. landscape effects was tested by selecting study sites along a gradient of structural complexity from simple landscapes (∼100% arable land) to complex landscapes (up to 70% semi-natural habitats such as fallows, field margins, hedges and grassland). Landscape complexity was assessed within landscape sectors of 0·5–4·0 km radius around strips.; ; 4.  Syrphid density and in particular, the density of aphidophagous species, was higher in narrow and broad sown flower strips compared to grassy strips and wheat–wheat boundary controls at the milk-ripening stage of the wheat. In addition, species richness of aphidophagous syrphids within wheat fields adjacent to broad sown flower strips was higher at the wheat peak-ripening stage. This indicates a spillover between habitats and a positive effect of these sown flower strips on potential biocontrol of cereal aphids. Flower densities and syrphid diversity and density, respectively, were closely related.; ; 5.  Species richness and abundance in the sown flower strips increased as the proportion of arable land in the surrounding landscape increased, suggesting that within structurally simple landscapes (at 0·5–1 km radius around the sites) syrphid flies concentrated on the most rewarding resources within the sown flower strips. Sown flower strips were more effective at increasing syrphid species richness and abundance in simple landscapes, presumably because the creation of flower resources made the greatest difference in such homogeneous, intensively managed arable landscapes.; ; 6.  Synthesis and applications. Agri-environment schemes should take the surrounding landscape characteristics into account when considering using sown flower strips to enhance syrphid density and diversity, and their biocontrol function, in arable landscapes. Creating locally such flower strips is more effective in simple landscapes containing a high proportion of arable land, while in complex landscapes, keeping the overall diversity is important.",46,5,1106,1114,Biodiversity; Ecology; Population density; Grassland; Hoverfly; Species richness; Species diversity; Arable land; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01685.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01685.x https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093298822 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01685.x/abstract https://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND44267099 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20093298822.html https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01685.x https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/766417 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01685.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01685.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01685.x,2112090623,,0,000-421-021-678-271; 004-916-984-876-81X; 008-225-619-668-580; 008-821-738-651-977; 010-945-646-716-071; 011-508-246-956-659; 011-672-108-275-761; 012-267-243-122-028; 013-367-327-282-701; 013-539-528-365-106; 015-796-697-992-282; 020-822-904-372-092; 021-456-573-673-200; 022-392-117-877-556; 022-771-502-946-159; 025-117-138-466-353; 027-405-522-971-388; 029-579-901-365-591; 030-240-600-484-24X; 033-118-437-839-732; 035-691-308-793-277; 038-714-740-525-771; 042-749-789-102-563; 045-924-425-733-406; 048-575-981-800-661; 050-985-622-056-969; 052-272-715-378-177; 053-505-331-627-489; 054-274-474-416-858; 056-101-024-270-22X; 056-822-231-800-190; 062-036-445-726-722; 062-218-780-389-812; 062-554-425-020-511; 068-730-938-041-13X; 070-194-102-378-889; 070-573-740-499-634; 072-817-046-222-302; 075-182-328-430-399; 080-035-418-642-978; 080-094-470-063-850; 082-117-114-903-173; 086-402-015-642-906; 090-682-458-827-532; 093-255-909-243-759; 096-920-887-442-138; 098-312-271-690-700; 099-545-753-107-454; 101-226-492-644-199; 103-348-929-033-891; 105-301-641-863-030; 113-738-969-445-037; 115-537-551-650-895; 123-831-368-241-900; 127-699-601-161-529; 133-272-860-021-373; 135-162-787-756-896; 148-203-562-421-657; 148-510-873-134-137; 152-041-007-966-282; 155-983-720-842-240; 159-540-954-848-947; 161-072-580-272-396; 166-248-084-772-47X; 168-891-232-106-045; 184-899-964-527-087; 189-171-337-953-001; 198-970-927-454-349,167

Wäckers; Felix J.J.A. Bianchi,"Non-crop habitats provide important resources for natural enemies. Many natural enemies hibernate in non-crop habitats, from which they may colonise arable fields in the spring. Spring colonisation ensures annual repopulation of the crop with natural enemies, allowing them to keep pace with the development of pest populations. The availability of non-crop habitats can, therefore, be crucial to successful conservation biological control. We quantified the density of overwintering natural enemies near organic Brussels sprout crops in five different non-crop habitats (short grassy field margin, herbaceous field margin, herbaceous field margin under a tree line, ditch and forest). Soil and litter samples of non-crop habitats were taken at two sites. One site was located in an open agricultural landscape, the other in a landscape dominated by mixed forest. Insects belonging to Staphylinidae, Araneae, Carabidae, Coccinellidae and Dermaptera were the most abundant. Mean densities of predatory arthropods were higher in the open agricultural landscape (290 predators m−2) than in the forested landscape (137 predators m−2). Herbaceous habitat types supported the highest densities of overwintering predators (up to 400 predators m−2), whereas densities in the forest were lowest (10 predators m−2). These results indicate that herbaceous non-crop habitats are important refugia for predators and may play a vital role in conservation biological control.",54,4,529,535,Biodiversity; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Overwintering; Beneficial insects; Animal ecology; Herbaceous plant; Pest control; Agroforestry; Biology,,,,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/540485 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10526-008-9206-5/fulltext.html https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093238686 https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/28208 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10526-008-9206-5 http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/374555 https://edepot.wur.nl/22447 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10526-008-9206-5.pdf https://paperity.org/p/24476754/hibernation-of-predatory-arthropods-in-semi-natural-habitats https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/29254400.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-008-9206-5,,10.1007/s10526-008-9206-5,2070441605,,0,011-508-246-956-659; 012-466-311-051-172; 013-270-209-241-22X; 013-526-378-431-354; 015-578-334-267-852; 016-823-705-101-257; 017-002-878-840-590; 019-234-857-538-507; 022-070-333-305-083; 029-264-530-643-997; 047-367-958-846-378; 053-024-791-968-164; 055-083-398-263-398; 056-892-630-404-500; 065-845-292-318-056; 069-379-822-515-162; 077-532-222-012-842; 087-186-786-234-321; 087-506-904-720-671; 115-507-657-132-984; 116-248-931-468-679; 122-528-143-728-138; 141-759-936-693-745; 145-653-851-729-665; 171-958-011-858-00X; 176-100-710-487-88X,82

Delettre; Philippe Morant; Françoise Burel,"Dramatic changes have occurred in agricultural landscapes of western Europe since the 1950s. Their effects on biodiversity have been documented at local scales in terms of agricultural practices and management of uncultivated elements, more than at the landscape level. The highest diversity of agricultural landscape structure found in Brittany (France) is characterised by hedgerows surrounding arable fields and permanent grasslands. Some areas did not change much over a few decades, while others were totally transformed by agricultural intensification, field enlargement and removal of hedges. The present paper aimed at examining if this landscape context affected carabid beetles communities in hedgerows. In 11 sites of 1 km 2 each, land use diversity and heterogeneity, hedgerow connectivity and landscape openness were measured. Carabid beetles sampled in hedgerows were identified to species, and grouped in functional units. Multivariate analyses were used to relate the spatial distribution of insects to different parameters of landscape structure. The results show a significant relationship between landscape structure and carabid communities. Forest species were more abundant in dense hedgerow networks with a relatively high ratio of permanent grasslands. Landscape opening induced a shift in species composition; the relative abundance of large species decreased while small, mobile and more ubiquitous species were favoured. Two trajectories of landscape change were identified, which led to different responses in communities, the increase in maize for milk production opening the landscape far more than cereal crops associated with industrial pig or poultry production. Changes were most important in the latter case. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Feber; H. Smith; David W. Macdonald,"1. The abundance and species richness of butterflies on expanded-width uncropped arable field edges, which were subject to 10 contrasting, experimental management regimes, were measured using transects in 1989, 1990 and 1991. The effects of the management regimes on a number of botanical variables, likely to be of importance to butterflies, were measured. 2. On the experimental field edges, butterfly abundance and species richness fluctuated between years and peaked at different times each year. 3. Butterfly abundance and species richness differed between experimental treatments. Plots which were either cut in the spring and autumn, or not cut at all, attracted more individuals and species of butterfly than did plots cut in the summer. Sowing with a grass and wild flower seed mixture increased butterfly abundance. Butterfly abundance declined on swards sprayed once annually with herbicide. 4. Mowing, sowing and spraying had significant effects on mean flower abundance, on the annual and perennial components flowering in the sward, and on the abundance of commonly used nectar sources and larval host-plants. 5. Stepwise multiple regression analyses on butterfly and plant data showed that the abundance of adults of most butterfly species was most closely associated with the abundance of flowers of key nectar source species. 6. The results are discussed in relation to resource provision for larval and adult butterfly stages.

The main objectives of this study were to establish the contribution of narrow riparian habitat strips to plant biodiversity in farming landscape and to document whether they could be reservoir of weeds detrimental to agriculture. Twenty-nine sections (>400 m) of riparian habitats adjacent to cropfields were inventoried in summer 1996 and spring 1997, and these were grouped into five vegetation types: (1) herbaceous strips dominated by grasses and devoid of woody species, (2) herbaceous strips dominated by forbs also devoid of woody species, (3) strips with small ( 10 m). A total of 280 (228 herbaceous and 52 woody) plant species were recorded. Overall habitats with trees contained a larger number of herb and woody species than other riparian habitats. However, this was not reflected in the species richness per unit area (quadrats) which meant that habitats with trees were more heterogeneous than other habitat types. Species composition differed considerably among the various riparian habitats when considering forest spring ephemerals, ferns, forbs in general, grasses and woody vegetation. Substantially more native wetland species (obligate and facultative) were recorded adjacent to watercourses than near fields. More weedy and in particular, introduced species, were found in quadrats sampled near cropfields. Although no plant species of special conservation value were located in the riparian habitats, they should deserve special protection in intensive agricultural areas because they harbour a suite of wetland plants (and animals) not found in other farmland habitats. This appears to be especially desirable for those habitats with a well-developed woody vegetation.",94,1,73,87,Riparian zone; Woody plant; Biodiversity; Forb; Vegetation; Introduced species; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Species richness,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880902000142,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-8809(02)00014-2,,10.1016/s0167-8809(02)00014-2,2064995277,,0,000-040-937-274-69X; 003-054-551-205-858; 004-807-568-531-692; 007-361-282-044-640; 010-083-294-693-008; 012-335-108-074-344; 013-960-910-763-50X; 014-322-432-919-02X; 015-863-314-524-72X; 015-983-230-964-804; 020-360-071-779-440; 020-408-098-790-113; 021-187-528-186-865; 021-933-813-475-043; 026-825-605-796-532; 029-105-025-347-654; 031-712-522-366-166; 033-965-464-922-934; 035-187-836-476-838; 036-722-726-289-60X; 038-659-320-814-260; 039-208-787-164-04X; 043-062-864-287-955; 046-529-848-837-393; 047-546-677-833-03X; 047-800-573-929-302; 051-197-969-663-775; 053-632-634-794-921; 055-777-094-247-213; 056-853-622-256-040; 058-218-489-015-546; 060-474-216-383-073; 063-003-550-683-547; 068-143-605-669-192; 068-933-096-514-243; 082-856-470-932-156; 083-292-483-412-825; 083-665-162-525-30X; 084-744-111-694-770; 088-470-568-990-908; 091-707-812-404-482; 093-484-061-728-036; 096-074-282-606-638; 104-230-077-662-702; 105-658-519-498-107; 108-007-092-968-56X; 108-604-669-561-218; 111-977-258-540-965; 112-148-110-351-322; 128-157-492-794-65X; 134-475-232-519-759; 137-827-292-132-666; 138-300-583-506-58X; 145-199-506-693-553; 150-494-637-604-381; 152-908-202-983-300; 154-750-119-428-838; 155-555-776-794-70X; 156-624-196-949-616; 158-345-384-701-811; 170-230-483-322-002; 174-769-391-601-877; 176-481-005-284-747,62

Udawatta; Stephen H. Anderson,"Enhancement of root development helps to improve soil physical properties, carbon sequestration, and water quality of streams. The objective of this study was to evaluate differences in root length density (RLD) and root and soil carbon content within grass buffer (GB), agroforestry buffer (AgB), rotationally grazed pasture (RG) and continuously grazed pasture (CG) treatments. Pasture and GB areas included red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) and lespedeza (Kummerowia stipulacea Maxim.) planted into fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) while AgB included Eastern cottonwood trees (Populus deltoids Bortr. ex Marsh.) planted into fescue. One-meter deep soil cores were collected from each treatment in August 2007 and 2008 with a soil probe. Three soil cores were sampled at six replicate sampling positions. Soil cores were collected in plastic tubes inserted inside the metal soil probe. Soils were segregated by horizons, and roots were separated into three diameter classes (0–1, 1–2, >2 mm) by soil horizon. Root length was determined using a flatbed scanner assisted with computer software. Buffer treatments (167 cm/100 cm3) had 4.5 times higher RLD as compared to pasture treatments (37.3 cm/100 cm3). The AgB treatment had the highest (173.5 cm/100 cm3) RLD and CG pasture had the lowest (10.8 cm/100 cm3) value. Root carbon was about 3% higher for the buffers compared to RG treatment. Soil carbon was about 115% higher for the buffers compared to pasture treatments. Results from this study imply that establishment of agroforestry and GB on grazed pasture watersheds improve soil carbon accumulation and root parameters which enhance soil physical and chemical properties thus improving the environmental quality of the landscape.",80,1,85,96,Soil classification; Soil horizon; Soil water; Festuca arundinacea; Pasture; Kummerowia stipulacea; Alfisol; Environmental science; Soil carbon; Agroforestry,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-010-9312-0/fulltext.html https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/790400 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103292175.html https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103292175 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10457-010-9312-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-010-9312-0,,10.1007/s10457-010-9312-0,2070417904,,0,004-312-190-242-017; 004-771-960-697-150; 004-913-406-899-063; 005-489-558-984-378; 006-665-243-997-672; 009-037-937-458-237; 011-084-469-305-195; 014-199-556-712-943; 017-759-042-122-884; 022-449-873-473-500; 026-545-955-800-312; 027-189-723-256-547; 028-291-930-527-554; 029-594-914-686-04X; 029-811-038-300-984; 033-643-094-520-556; 034-236-366-917-732; 036-664-186-194-585; 040-179-045-641-930; 042-763-420-741-542; 043-056-074-783-443; 045-654-926-139-408; 049-996-017-477-827; 054-619-304-992-861; 057-155-441-521-798; 059-970-253-584-904; 060-492-740-476-988; 061-769-894-252-253; 062-143-711-138-127; 065-609-212-691-21X; 067-965-142-160-459; 075-047-231-918-142; 075-984-704-458-892; 077-156-315-626-222; 080-211-534-827-144; 082-684-953-855-337; 086-353-557-236-218; 086-372-600-969-77X; 088-017-310-971-747; 089-976-173-308-438; 093-536-634-301-382; 095-198-700-641-515; 095-442-963-985-661; 095-819-935-363-598; 096-518-290-911-83X; 099-557-323-847-418; 101-012-916-569-644; 108-449-865-708-881; 108-938-515-566-470; 109-762-336-700-435; 116-497-595-378-726; 123-334-480-318-27X; 127-785-284-544-120; 129-156-349-985-324; 134-629-798-975-947; 138-163-095-166-16X; 142-222-273-208-839; 150-117-449-077-365; 161-490-085-163-215; 163-829-609-921-025; 168-211-026-916-07X; 171-367-584-331-825; 173-909-008-294-073; 174-139-838-509-57X; 174-726-204-237-847; 178-580-904-343-305; 199-630-143-857-938,35

Stockan; Simon J. Langan; Mark R. Young,"Buffer strips alongside watercourses are a widely accepted method of reducing nutrient and sediment run-off from agricultural land thereby improving water quality. Little attention, however, has been paid to the ecological status of these areas despite the fact that riparian habitats in good condition can provide multiple benefits. We investigated vegetation patterns and plant-environment relationships within three categories of riparian margins in northeast Scotland. The margins were categorized as unbuffered, buffered, or reference (target), the latter representing the best sites available within the catchments. Vascular plant and soil data were collected from 41 sites along the tributaries of two rivers during 2008 and 2009. Ellenberg indicator values revealed trends of decreasing light availability ( < 0.05) and decreasing pH ( < 0.01) from unbuffered sites to buffered sites to reference sites. Multivariate analysis showed that soil parameters and channel morphology, together with canopy cover and bryophyte abundance, were discriminatory in separating species assemblages. The presence of a tree canopy layer appears to be the key instigator of change in soil conditions and corresponding plant species assemblages. An understanding of the underlying processes is important if vegetation characteristics are to be used effectively as indicators of riparian and water quality and to aid the restoration of riparian habitats.",41,2,364,372,Riparian zone; Indicator value; Vegetation; Habitat; Ecology; Water quality; Environmental science; Tree canopy; Buffer strip; Abundance (ecology),,Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources/methods; Plant Development; Plants/classification; Scotland; Time Factors,,The Scottish Government Rural and Environment Research and Analysis Directorate,https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2134/jeq2010.0518 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22370398 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22370398/ https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/pdfs/41/2/364 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/22370398 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2134/jeq2010.0518,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2010.0518,22370398,10.2134/jeq2010.0518,1966966716,,0,001-631-192-686-120; 003-837-175-999-48X; 014-005-967-253-86X; 015-256-006-013-114; 020-443-031-361-49X; 022-890-434-087-998; 026-509-531-770-449; 027-890-402-247-143; 028-917-029-117-685; 029-264-530-643-997; 031-517-027-046-399; 034-392-803-659-319; 035-093-656-083-327; 041-242-474-179-014; 043-900-591-870-482; 047-341-007-247-294; 049-348-473-502-031; 049-446-733-721-951; 052-649-478-130-801; 056-572-672-082-930; 058-950-840-663-346; 067-981-175-659-248; 070-129-859-863-682; 071-472-555-561-698; 076-377-649-956-283; 077-795-065-837-764; 078-656-261-879-626; 089-666-783-993-328; 096-743-675-311-342; 098-207-763-384-799; 102-772-940-406-544; 119-071-499-980-291; 122-159-545-592-770; 123-195-638-496-459; 126-051-201-417-566; 142-547-277-931-181; 142-939-430-049-615; 154-426-260-853-871; 176-664-883-657-81X; 180-744-781-135-863; 193-079-181-489-806; 197-011-426-660-363; 197-675-399-723-999,14

Miller; David J. Lewis; Michael Lennox; Maria das Graças C. Pereira; Kenneth W. Tate; Patricia A. Conrad; Edward R. Atwill,"Climatic factors and on-farm management practices were evaluated for their association with the concentrations (cyst/liter) and instantaneous loads (cysts/second) of Giardia duodenalis in storm-based runoff from dairy lots and other high-cattle-use areas on five coastal California farms over two storm seasons. Direct fluorescent antibody analysis was used to quantitate cysts in 350 storm runoff samples. G. duodenalis was detected on all five dairy farms, with fluxes of 1 to 14,000 cysts/liter observed in 16% of samples. Cysts were detected in 41% of runoff samples collected near cattle less than 2 months old, compared to 10% of runoff samples collected near cattle over 6 months old. Furthermore, the concentrations and instantaneous loads of cysts were >65 and >79 times greater, respectively, in runoff from sites housing young calves than in sites housing other age classes of animals. Factors associated with environmental loading of G. duodenalis included cattle age, cattle stocking number, and precipitation but not lot area, land slope, or cattle density. Vegetated buffer strips were found to significantly reduce waterborne cysts in storm runoff: each additional meter of vegetated buffer placed below high-cattle-use areas was associated with reductions in the concentration and instantaneous load of cysts by factors of 0.86 and 0.79 (0.07 and 0.10 log10/m), respectively. Straw mulch, seed application, scraping of manure, and cattle exclusion did not significantly affect the concentration or load of G. duodenalis cysts. The study findings suggest that vegetated buffer strips, especially when placed near dairy calf areas, should help reduce the environmental loading of these fecal protozoa discharging from dairy farms.",73,21,6972,6979,Storm; Animal science; Stocking; Ecology; Dairy cattle; Giardia; Cattle Diseases; Manure; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Surface runoff,,Agriculture/methods; Animals; California; Cattle; Cattle Diseases/microbiology; Climate; Dairying/methods; Feces/microbiology; Giardia/growth & development; Humans; Public Health; Quality Control; Rain; Risk Factors; Seasons; Soil Microbiology; Water Microbiology; Water Pollutants/toxicity,Water Pollutants,CSR NIH HHS (R21 RG000142) United States; CSR NIH HHS (U09 RG000142) United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17873066 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2074936 https://ucdavis.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/climate-and-on-farm-risk-factors-associated-with-giardia-duodenal https://aem.asm.org/content/aem/73/21/6972.full.pdf http://aem.asm.org/content/73/21/6972.full https://aem.asm.org/content/73/21/6972 http://www.marinrcd.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UCCE_AEMTomales_Giardia-duodenalis_2007.11.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/aem.00100-07,17873066,10.1128/aem.00100-07,2170449053,PMC2074936,0,000-507-453-793-713; 001-499-653-430-625; 002-150-511-763-98X; 003-987-711-192-684; 004-528-269-351-059; 009-682-439-544-150; 019-743-783-190-979; 021-824-107-956-621; 023-163-603-577-492; 026-703-138-365-235; 031-504-330-791-153; 037-068-878-542-929; 038-635-613-899-556; 038-675-377-092-297; 040-489-534-652-693; 041-734-577-789-422; 043-821-012-981-028; 046-807-294-441-289; 051-814-821-041-364; 058-433-543-136-843; 058-745-494-117-365; 060-562-627-410-849; 071-064-051-195-409; 081-291-230-402-445; 084-466-516-936-566; 085-598-890-890-554; 091-955-325-303-96X; 092-222-795-775-61X; 092-616-317-176-630; 094-296-209-910-01X; 107-902-822-893-382; 114-004-448-756-044; 130-194-021-400-153; 140-402-720-483-193; 177-517-070-183-860; 180-107-122-045-678; 182-447-544-042-307; 186-564-812-165-812,37

Conover; Eric T. Linder,"Avian communities can benefit from reconstructed herbaceous, strip habitats among agriculture; however, any benefits may be limited by width-dependent factors such as edge effects. We used 2 years of strip-transect surveys to evaluate avian density, richness, and conservation value between non-, narrow (mean width 5 8.2 m), and wide (mean width 5 40.7 m) field borders on intensive row-cropped field margins in the agriculture-dominated Mississippi Alluvial Valley. Wide field borders supported two times more birds (7.0 birds/0.2 ha) than narrow borders (3.6 birds/ 0.2 ha), which supported six times more birds than no border (0.6 birds/0.2 ha). Mean bird species richness was over five times greater in bordered (0.80-1.10 species/0.2 ha) than non-bordered margins (0.14 species/0.2 ha), but was largely uninfluenced by border width. We documented more bird use of agricultural fields and wooded fencerows adjacent to bordered than non-bordered margins. Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and Dickcissels (Spiza americana) had the strongest positive response to field border presence and width. Wide borders attracted high densities (2.0 birds/0.2 ha) of Dickcissels, an edge-sensitive species, suggesting the conservation potential of herbaceous vegetation patches ,50 m of wooded edges for grassland birds.

115-634-765-197-007,Spatial autocorrelation in honeybee foraging activity reveals optimal focus scale for predicting agro-environmental scheme efficiency,,2012,journal article,Ecological Modelling,03043800; 18727026,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Mickaël Henry; Marie Fröchen; Julie Maillet-Mezeray; Elisabeth Breyne; Fabrice Allier; Jean-François Odoux; Axel Decourtye,"Abstract A substantial honeybee decline is being observed worldwide. Agricultural intensification and loss of wild floral resources rank among the main factors contributing to this decline. Landscape enhancement of floral resources has been proposed as an agro-environmental scheme intended to provide honeybees with compensatory food sources in intensive agrosystems. Floral scheme efficiency has rarely been evaluated with respect to landscape context. In this study, we developed and validated a modeling tool to delineate the landscape areas likely to be associated with higher efficiency of floral enhancement schemes. In particular, the proximity of some landscape elements used by honeybees, either as foraging habitat or as visual landmark for orientation, may partly determine floral scheme efficiency. We investigated this issue using resource selection functions (RSFs), i.e. models that aim to predict the occurrence of foraging honeybees at floral patches as a function of the presence of keystone landscape elements in their proximity. However, deciding which landscape elements are effectively in the proximity or not is mostly a matter of subjectivity. The novelty of our approach resides in its use of a distance-weighting function to explicitly account for the spatial location of surrounding landscape elements. In that respect, a distance function should be scaled on movement patterns of foraging organisms. Herein, we inferred movement patterns from the autocorrelative properties of honeybee foraging activity. This modeling approach was developed on Phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia) field margin strips, a typical “honeybee-friendly” floral scheme. A foraging survey conducted on 170 Phacelia plots (2 m × 2 m) from 17 Phacelia strips, all positioned within the foraging range of an experimental apiary, revealed that (i) the floral scheme efficiency is positively influenced by the presence of linear landscape elements such as hedgerows and forest edges, but negatively affected by the presence of alternative floral resources, and that (ii) weighting the relative importance of those landscape elements by incorporating a distance function into models considerably improved their predictive power. This modeling tool has the potential to help land managers optimizing their financial investment by avoiding low-efficiency landscape areas, or favoring high-efficiency ones, at the time of planning floral enhancement schemes.",225,,103,114,Spatial analysis; Foraging; Resource (biology); Habitat; Ecology; Phacelia tanacetifolia; Phacelia; Context (language use); Scale (map); Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380011005448 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecomod/v225y2012icp103-114.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.11.015,,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.11.015,2051630109,,0,000-630-648-290-28X; 004-795-863-113-922; 008-225-619-668-580; 009-361-087-991-944; 010-225-312-935-498; 011-113-313-615-090; 011-418-694-824-781; 012-267-243-122-028; 018-442-796-237-224; 020-257-178-016-86X; 021-032-467-070-896; 022-321-534-473-933; 027-001-115-615-588; 031-007-699-396-56X; 032-502-062-020-869; 032-555-988-750-59X; 033-753-016-098-051; 034-333-107-858-752; 037-649-247-809-59X; 040-572-453-396-234; 041-600-530-288-483; 051-038-371-024-727; 054-328-419-977-493; 054-757-028-284-265; 056-099-523-856-735; 060-190-757-297-843; 061-676-114-857-225; 063-809-373-703-852; 066-580-174-554-918; 070-511-664-279-985; 074-162-652-768-805; 076-307-235-228-944; 081-588-490-733-096; 081-887-221-003-909; 082-594-769-377-348; 083-170-367-313-074; 083-890-181-161-186; 085-507-496-811-84X; 085-590-323-362-839; 088-921-085-034-823; 095-522-959-685-498; 103-916-155-858-365; 107-188-835-457-613; 120-524-273-028-868; 145-127-779-375-427; 145-886-795-701-55X; 154-978-657-665-321; 157-188-990-173-112; 178-204-705-823-673; 184-899-964-527-087; 195-618-519-387-640,33

Investigations began as soon as rape seedlings emerged and lasted for five weeks. Slug damage to rape plants 1 m from the grass strips was significantly higher than at greater distances from the strips. Deroceras reticulatum was the most abundant slug species recorded in both grass strips and adjacent rape fields. Arion lusitanicus and Arion fasciatus were much less abundant than D. reticulatum. In one field, D. reticulatum declined steadily with increasing distance from the grass strips and therefore appeared to have caused the majority of severe damage to rape plants close to the strips. This finding was surprising because until now severe slug damage in oilseed rape beside semi-natural habitats has been observed only where A. lusitanicus was abundant.",64,4,461,466,Deroceras reticulatum; Arion lusitanicus; Slug; Arion fasciatus; Botany; Biology,,,,,https://boris.unibe.ch/115622/ https://academic.oup.com/mollus/article/64/4/461/981299 http://mollus.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/4/461.full.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/212372354.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mollus/64.4.461,,10.1093/mollus/64.4.461,2146060979,,0,007-007-938-839-461; 028-413-834-942-793; 031-104-721-708-756; 047-711-433-977-172; 051-103-549-479-234; 077-211-077-089-554; 079-665-929-214-570; 087-185-351-771-625; 087-186-786-234-321; 096-516-522-376-989; 120-106-070-548-722; 127-772-139-968-952; 154-414-925-286-966,17

Therefore, it is important to understand the role of hedgerows in runoff and sediment processes. In this study, 36 field runoff simulation experiments were conducted in the red soil region of China to determine flow hydraulics and soil loss processes under 12 different hedgerow conditions. Specifically, two types of hedgerow widths (two-row and three-row) were planted for each of three species of vegetation (Bahia grass (Paspalum notatum), Vetiver (Vetiveria nigritana) and Daylily (Hemerocallis fulva)), and these plots were tested both before and after the removal of the grass stems. Grass stems played an important role in decreasing the flow velocity and filtering sediment. For the three selected vegetation types, the final flow velocities (V3) were ranked in the following order: Bahia grass (0.12 m/s)  30%) than the two-row hedges (decrease ratio",148,,97,105,Vegetation; Hemerocallis fulva; Daylily; Paspalum notatum; Sediment; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Red soil; Agronomy; Flow (psychology),,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167198714002840,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2014.12.009,,10.1016/j.still.2014.12.009,2022812903,,0,000-987-201-023-021; 003-232-594-172-08X; 007-500-821-929-120; 013-876-886-875-533; 018-956-547-227-04X; 023-969-777-620-975; 024-804-067-920-990; 025-296-906-047-191; 029-172-069-971-512; 033-890-182-096-159; 037-378-159-708-535; 042-417-252-147-728; 044-750-571-884-583; 045-511-501-160-748; 046-892-304-956-18X; 049-252-519-382-412; 049-953-430-519-744; 050-261-198-479-060; 051-511-348-914-781; 052-748-425-792-522; 057-131-240-501-938; 058-182-081-440-299; 059-381-194-377-394; 069-301-142-194-65X; 070-544-365-764-471; 072-164-353-760-56X; 079-415-753-237-59X; 080-894-085-139-156; 086-278-743-531-248; 088-714-563-342-774; 089-905-230-122-341; 092-498-166-624-699; 095-099-061-549-857; 096-023-267-413-774; 098-228-556-964-873; 098-855-377-399-971; 105-484-476-935-241; 108-423-824-994-134; 109-953-506-304-374; 122-953-498-931-79X; 130-284-618-355-681; 134-147-903-361-356; 135-138-272-402-482; 163-482-465-575-353; 166-648-088-163-172; 168-193-278-954-64X; 170-710-514-965-16X; 190-651-241-686-226; 193-256-129-811-532; 197-229-717-839-410; 197-430-645-554-460; 198-829-407-898-269,37

J. Krutz; Scott A. Senseman; Kevin J. McInnes; Dennis W. Hoffman; Dennis P. Tierney,"Previous studies have indicated that dissolved-phase metolachlor [2-chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-(methoxy-1-methylethyl) acetamide] transported in surface runoff is retained by vegetative filter strips to a greater degree than either metolachlor oxanilic acid 12-[(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl) (2-methoxy-1-methylethyl)amino]-2-oxo-acetic acid] (OA) or metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid [2-[(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl) (2-methoxy-1-methylethyl-1)amino]-2-oxoethanesul-fonic acid] (ESA), two primary metabolites of metolachlor. Adsorption-desorption of ESA and OA in vegetated filter strip soil (VFSS) has not been evaluated, yet these data are required to assess the mobility of these compounds in VFSS. The objective of this experiment was to compare metolachlor, ESA, and OA adsorption and desorption parameters between VFSS and cultivated soil (CS). Adsorption and desorption isotherms were determined using the batch equilibrium procedure. With the exception of a 1.7-fold increase in organic carbon content in the VFSS, the evaluated chemical and physical properties of the soils were similar. Sorption coefficients for metolachlor were 88% higher in VFSS than in CS. In contrast, sorption coefficients for ESA and OA were not different between soils. Relative to metolachlor, sorption coefficients for ESA and OA were at least 79% lower in both soils. Metolachlor desorption coefficients were 59% higher in the VFSS than in the CS. Desorption coefficients for ESA and OA were not different between soils. Relative to metolachlor, desorption coefficients for ESA and OA were at least 66% lower in both soils. These data indicate that the mobility of ESA and OA will be greater than metolachlor in both soils. However, higher organic carbon content in VFSS relative to CS may limit the subsequent transport of metolachlor from the vegetated filter strip.",33,3,939,945,Environmental chemistry; Adsorption; Total organic carbon; Soil water; Desorption; Chemistry; Metolachlor; Filter strip; Ethanesulfonic acid; Sorption,,Acetamides/analysis; Adsorption; Carbon/chemistry; Filtration; Herbicides/analysis; Kinetics; Plants; Soil Pollutants/analysis; Solubility,Acetamides; Herbicides; Soil Pollutants; Carbon; metolachlor,,https://www.agronomy.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/33/3/0939 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2134/jeq2004.0939 https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/64022000/Publications/Krutz/Krutzetal.2004a.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15224930,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2004.0939,15224930,10.2134/jeq2004.0939,2006659225,,0,000-632-369-179-641; 005-046-617-641-306; 008-014-245-985-660; 008-169-271-513-110; 011-595-430-409-872; 011-668-475-983-688; 011-759-706-449-786; 013-653-385-493-985; 018-844-270-331-939; 019-441-740-247-409; 024-114-825-402-271; 024-618-280-817-643; 025-131-472-929-81X; 025-167-489-777-474; 027-305-363-358-472; 029-227-515-568-324; 033-999-279-950-218; 034-195-159-242-383; 036-673-850-253-745; 040-594-372-324-05X; 050-475-431-512-845; 052-894-240-545-387; 053-266-494-689-099; 055-442-435-256-00X; 075-027-223-325-971; 079-340-147-769-242; 083-803-932-037-55X; 084-832-446-427-308; 094-049-137-663-313; 103-148-967-328-600; 103-286-115-762-912; 106-008-596-264-779; 107-200-356-531-213; 111-288-588-656-115; 111-770-657-246-810; 116-978-036-093-73X; 125-964-863-167-615; 130-429-179-151-365; 131-618-740-818-698; 133-363-147-232-814; 138-106-636-448-370; 140-291-848-621-795; 168-502-640-537-635; 169-120-654-024-227; 177-713-612-499-367; 178-140-173-536-98X; 183-809-836-623-56X,39

Ribic; David W. Sample,"Abstract We investigated the association of grassland birds with field- and landscape-level habitat variables in south-central Wisconsin during 1985–1987. Landscape-level variables were measured and digitized at 200, 400 and 800 m from the perimeter of 38 200 m × 100 m strip transects. A mixture of field and landscape variables was associated with the density of savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) and grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum). Only landscape variables were associated with the density of bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna) and all birds that were grassland species of management concern. Field size was not an important predictor of bird density. Cover-type diversity of the surrounding area was commonly selected in the models for three species and all birds that were grassland species of management concern. Higher bird densities in the transects were associated with landscapes where the cover types were less diverse.

Buddle; Sean Higgins; Ann L. Rypstra,"Abstract Generalist predators, such as spiders, play an important role as natural enemies in agroecosystems and, given the annual disturbance of most field crops, these predators typically re-colonize fields from adjacent habitats such as hedgerows or riparian forests. To test whether the biota of these source habitats differed, we collected ground-dwelling spiders (Araneae) from thin ( 50 m) riparian forests and hedgerows (<15 m wide) located next to soybean or corn fields in south-west Ohio. Pitfall traps collected spiders at the stream edge, the interior of forests or hedgerows and the agricultural edge. Rarefaction analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination tested how spider diversity and community structure, respectively, differed between hedgerows and riparian forests and by trap location. Wide riparian forests harbored a higher diversity of spiders than thin riparian forests and hedgerows contained the lowest spider diversity.

Everyone liked hedged landscapes for aesthetic, visual and wildlife reasons. They were important for the way they break up the landscape; provide signs of the changing seasons; their sense of mystery and intimacy; their connections with the past and childhood memories. They are also seen as part of England’s history and national identity. Such cultural identity was absent in the Canadian data. ; ; However, some groups also held a rational or objective view which was dominant over this subjective or emotional view and which affects where they draw the boundaries to their systems of interest. Farmers were most concerned with their farms (and the hedgerows they owned) as a business, while experts dealt mainly with the ecological aspects of hedgerows.; ; There was found to be little awareness of others groups views with different groups seeing the same action in very different ways. Even where there was contact between farmers and experts, there could be a lack of trust. ; ; Finally, it is noted that policy and practice towards hedgerows have ignored many of these relationships and that the approach used here offers opportunities to examine the different systems of interest.",,,,,Grounded theory; Geography; Action (philosophy); National identity; Diversity (politics); Childhood memory; Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory; Cultural identity; Social psychology; Landscape ecology; Environmental ethics,,,,,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.301884 http://oro.open.ac.uk/30150/1/Thesis_final_version_for_pdf.pdf http://oro.open.ac.uk/30150/,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.301884,,,1570546012,,0,000-482-274-551-278; 003-787-172-869-185; 004-005-374-517-935; 004-066-742-144-589; 006-317-246-044-307; 008-332-609-503-209; 008-989-399-003-447; 009-064-884-569-067; 009-748-379-423-160; 011-626-003-760-544; 014-796-492-834-84X; 015-013-726-939-074; 016-849-534-096-945; 016-944-193-681-825; 018-139-059-822-632; 024-639-250-608-763; 026-294-639-653-96X; 029-227-555-777-358; 030-702-410-083-844; 031-617-166-530-461; 031-683-602-759-955; 032-611-885-117-365; 032-706-927-928-142; 035-349-484-782-223; 039-420-737-419-364; 044-722-313-510-441; 044-835-065-952-101; 045-687-996-719-193; 046-778-560-951-661; 047-949-455-932-004; 048-126-212-661-325; 050-800-231-215-260; 052-089-028-282-135; 052-631-168-057-877; 054-957-218-746-041; 055-718-162-254-002; 056-145-312-470-386; 060-292-189-246-868; 061-093-685-366-37X; 061-781-977-099-225; 062-161-199-722-314; 062-641-101-397-502; 062-819-790-819-509; 068-338-940-513-574; 068-717-345-070-369; 073-416-616-182-189; 074-401-137-779-564; 079-268-656-589-609; 087-547-393-848-585; 088-934-637-295-013; 090-150-662-898-410; 093-255-909-243-759; 096-577-315-543-94X; 098-512-598-575-209; 099-962-913-938-095; 100-750-756-549-668; 102-654-057-589-444; 103-148-974-864-567; 105-894-501-129-797; 106-564-185-785-286; 107-818-790-347-544; 108-171-195-263-241; 116-400-197-325-860; 116-780-635-748-116; 123-216-253-586-314; 123-326-994-818-255; 126-952-687-817-313; 128-033-881-987-944; 130-293-828-310-486; 130-635-768-195-97X; 133-729-708-841-171; 137-348-409-746-883; 150-494-637-604-381; 151-373-242-368-025; 152-299-725-476-147; 155-894-330-176-241; 158-778-930-876-795; 158-807-850-939-178; 161-434-649-148-71X; 161-882-711-492-247; 166-225-562-284-365; 168-394-204-709-730; 170-626-374-241-677; 172-572-166-912-802; 174-998-195-814-372; 178-313-836-299-982; 180-150-519-711-927; 198-945-822-926-173; 199-099-283-796-694; 199-510-047-635-351,4

R. G. Mclachlan; S. D. Wratten,"Abstract The density and species composition of ground‐dwelling spiders were assessed using suction sampling from August 1994 to July 1995 at various distances from a field edge into a single grazed pasture, and from March 1996 to March 1997 in the same and three additional grazed pastures and adjacent fenced shelterbelts on the Canterbury Plains, New Zealand. Spider density declined rapidly with distance from the shelterbelt (mean 241 m–2) into the pasture (means 72.5 m–2 at 2.5 m, and 10.3 m–2 at 5 m). Mean spider densities in the four pastures were 53.0 m‐2 while in the shelterbelts they reached 316 m‐2. The fauna in both habitats was dominated by the European linyphiid, Tenuiphantes tenuis (Blackwall).

Helmers; Heidi Asbjornsen; Randall K. Kolka; Mark D. Tomer; Richard M. Cruse,"Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from agricultural landscapes have been identified as primary sources of excess nutrients in aquatic systems. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of prairie filter strips (PFS) in removing nutrients from cropland runoff in 12 small watersheds in central Iowa. Four treatments with PFS of different spatial coverage and distribution (No-PFS, 10% PFS, 10% PFS with strips, and 20% PFS with strips) were arranged in a balanced incomplete block design across four blocks in 2007. A no-tillage two-year corn (Zea mays L.) –soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) rotation was grown in row-cropped areas beginning in 2007. Runoff was monitored by H flumes, and runoff water samples were collected during the growing seasons to determine concentrations of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) through 2011. Overall, the presence of PFS reduced mean annual NO3-N, TN, and TP concentrations by 35%, 73%, and 82%, respectively, and reduced annual NO3-N, TN, and TP losses by 67%, 84%, and 90%, respectively. However, the amount and distribution of PFS had no significant impact on runoff and nutrient yields. The findings suggest that utilization of PFS at the footslope position of annual row crop systems provides an effective approach to reducing nutrient loss in runoff from small agricultural watersheds.",69,1,54,64,Filter (aquarium); Growing season; Nutrient; Aquatic ecosystem; Row crop; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Phosphorus; Nitrogen; Agronomy,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/38933390 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/abe_eng_pubs/596/ https://works.bepress.com/matthew_helmers/92/ https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1881&context=abe_eng_pubs https://www.jswconline.org/content/69/1/54 https://www.srs.fs.fed.us/pubs/46921 https://www.fs.fed.us/nrs/pubs/jrnl/2014/nrs_2014_zhou-x_001.pdf https://srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/46921 https://www.jswconline.org/lookup/doi/10.2489/jswc.69.1.54 https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/46921 https://core.ac.uk/download/38933390.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.69.1.54,,10.2489/jswc.69.1.54,2132108269,,0,002-430-400-638-330; 002-937-270-631-538; 003-148-094-786-550; 005-046-617-641-306; 006-715-296-348-046; 007-375-632-321-925; 018-103-292-961-116; 019-057-578-554-139; 025-714-041-289-368; 028-802-252-344-012; 030-682-084-703-597; 032-034-540-734-416; 036-788-465-020-398; 045-878-014-461-966; 050-040-531-606-168; 051-438-305-703-476; 055-192-571-710-917; 062-103-832-699-020; 066-727-776-146-130; 070-043-160-900-85X; 076-826-572-086-275; 078-870-777-882-17X; 086-154-086-081-122; 087-680-309-241-290; 088-017-310-971-747; 092-525-270-344-68X; 092-819-620-241-167; 100-294-657-477-930; 101-436-533-216-728; 110-163-690-092-234; 123-324-136-415-020; 126-961-510-728-424; 146-606-352-041-123; 164-778-477-702-099; 196-381-785-440-137,62

Little is known about activity-density and assemblage composition of carabid beetles within sown wildflower areas (SWA) compared with conventional grassy field margins and adjoining arable fields. 2 In 10 landscapes, two pairs of winter wheat fields with adjoining SWA and grassy field margin were studied. We compared activity-density, species richness, ecological traits and assemblage composition of carabids among 20 winter wheat fields, 10 adjoining grassy field margins and 10 adjoining SWA. 3 Beetle activity-density was higher in wheat fields compared with adjoining semi-natural habitats regarding total carabids, macropterous, polyphagous- carnivorous and euryoecious open habitat beetles. Although total species rich- ness (analysis of variance) did not significantly differ among habitat types, we found significantly higher species numbers in SWA than in wheat fields adjoining SWA and grassy margins when the number of recorded species was standardized to the number of individuals (rarefaction). Carabid assemblages in wheat fields differed from assemblages in adjoining SWA and grassy margins. 4 The results of the present study emphasize the important contribution of semi-natural habitats to diversify the spring carabid fauna in agroecosystems.

Fuller; Dan E. Chamberlain; N.H.K Burton; S. Gough,"Within agricultural landscapes many species of birds depend on hedgerows and woodland, but few studies have examined their relative importance as habitats for breeding birds. Breeding bird communities in hedgerows and woodland in lowland England and Wales were compared in terms of species richness and similarity of species composition. The preference of individual species for hedgerows and woodland was also assessed. The data were drawn from 33 farmland and 35 woodland Common Birds Census plots for 3 years: 1990, 1993 and 1996. Woodland plots were significantly richer in species than farmland plots. Species number on farmland plots increased linearly with the cover of farm woodland and non-linearly with density of total hedgerow. Species number increased with density of non-roadside hedgerows, but not with density of roadside hedgerows. Although the farmland and woodland plots supported distinctive bird communities, there was considerable overlap between them in species composition. The similarity between the species composition on individual farms and that theoretically possible for woodland increased significantly with the cover of farm woodland, hedgerow density and the total amount of woody habitat present within the farmland plot. Canonical correspondence analysis and preference indices indicated that seven species could be regarded as hedgerow specialists: Dunnock Prunella modularis, Whitethroat Sylvia communis, Lesser Whitethroat S. curruca, Linnet Carduelis cannabina, Goldfinch C. carduelis, Greenfinch C. chloris and Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella. Species showing clear preferences for woodland were: Tawny Owl Strix aluco, Marsh Tit Parus palustris, Coal Tit P. ater, Goldcrest Regulus regulus, Spotted Flycatcher Muscicapa striata, Treecreeper Certhia familiaris, Nuthatch Sitta europaea, Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major, Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita and Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla. The habitat needs of the hedgerow specialists show considerable variation and do not always coincide with the hedgerow structures that support the greatest numbers of bird species and highest densities of birds. Management strategies that maintain a diversity of hedgerow structures are, therefore, desirable. Hedgerow and woodland bird communities are essentially complementary and habitat creation initiatives in lowland agricultural landscapes should not be excessively weighted towards one habitat or the other.",84,1,79,92,Ecology; Woodland; Geography; Woodpecker; Treecreeper; Nuthatch; Carduelis; Dendrocopos major; Sitta europaea; Species richness,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880900001948,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-8809(00)00194-8,,10.1016/s0167-8809(00)00194-8,2084327837,,0,000-140-507-815-44X; 002-234-862-186-238; 008-818-755-662-005; 010-813-905-432-344; 012-786-800-731-307; 016-173-589-114-015; 020-107-919-310-166; 023-310-699-181-261; 029-634-852-427-088; 030-388-683-032-986; 031-706-636-786-651; 032-245-730-539-873; 038-938-722-350-317; 039-750-171-330-660; 043-181-971-444-92X; 047-629-763-761-275; 051-956-256-659-017; 058-809-241-738-876; 063-834-917-778-276; 071-601-656-233-384; 072-012-275-204-353; 073-095-171-851-962; 075-474-380-039-308; 079-261-909-912-581; 082-979-495-287-720; 091-415-969-356-605; 109-794-201-429-576; 110-552-589-386-667; 143-749-787-569-284; 144-496-244-396-544; 146-589-148-444-417,76

Hamon; Jean-Claude Marie; Michael S. Corson; Philippe Merot,"Hedgerow is one of the most important rural landscapes in the world, especially in Europe. Knowledge about the hydrological role of hedgerows is useful in many fields of study, such as hydrological modelling and rural landscape management. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a hedgerow on rainfall distribution, soil-water potential gradient, lateral water transfer and water balance. A hillslope with a hedgerow perpendicular to the slope was monitored. To evaluate hedgerow rainfall interception, rainfall was measured (hourly, daily, and by rainfall event) both next to and up to 16 m upslope and 12 m downslope perpendicularly away from the hedgerow. The strongest correlation between rainfall next to the hedgerow and rainfall at more distant points was obtained using data measured per rainfall event. The average percentage of rainfall intercepted equalled 28% for the leafed period and 12% for the leafless period. The impact of the hedgerow on spatial rainfall distribution was related to distance from the hedgerow and rainfall amount. Annual distribution of soil-water potential showed that the hedgerow influenced it up to 9 m upslope and 6 m downslope, the area in which most of the hedgerow's roots were observed. The soil was driest at the end of summer, which delayed soil rewetting during autumn in areas surrounding the hedgerow. Annual groundwater dynamics exhibited three distinct periods due to temporal rainfall distribution and, especially at the end of summer, root-water uptake. In addition, the total potential gradient showed that unsaturated flow was directed towards the hedgerow in summer and autumn. These results indicate that at the local scale hedgerows influences (1) spatial rainfall distribution, (2) soil rewetting, and (3) groundwater recharge, often at distances well beyond the hedgerow's drip line. Consequently, the processes involved in soil-water dynamics around hedgerows should be integrated into relevant hydrological models, especially for catchments with a dense hedgerow network.",22,24,4723,4735,Hydrological modelling; Soil water; Groundwater recharge; Water potential; Hydrology; Environmental science; Water table; Interception; Water balance; Hydrology (agriculture),,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.7081 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008HyPr...22.4723G/abstract https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/427849 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01460891,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7081,,10.1002/hyp.7081,2093924171,,0,000-030-009-645-380; 003-049-089-342-759; 003-391-661-011-410; 007-149-642-585-638; 010-578-199-579-316; 015-988-302-344-181; 016-651-806-548-439; 023-530-930-101-311; 025-296-906-047-191; 027-183-769-733-081; 027-508-322-472-615; 027-948-167-594-24X; 031-371-779-422-482; 031-616-203-019-263; 032-124-344-064-944; 035-621-094-786-173; 036-466-585-417-013; 038-249-246-575-713; 039-187-623-690-051; 039-717-634-771-012; 042-109-862-383-299; 044-936-183-176-484; 046-858-036-681-925; 047-175-308-437-162; 051-948-668-815-530; 057-015-286-235-390; 059-059-326-871-971; 062-590-691-329-894; 065-287-761-831-861; 083-149-726-254-365; 085-526-051-539-277; 094-474-879-444-037; 101-504-801-125-323; 104-404-527-699-287; 106-577-195-165-411; 115-354-687-170-450; 119-707-807-050-266; 121-342-906-721-400; 123-823-859-397-010; 124-228-518-685-882; 125-564-609-352-214; 126-507-210-991-407; 126-973-969-969-908; 130-109-751-983-048; 131-484-409-108-898; 140-466-876-403-682; 154-383-209-000-147; 156-624-196-949-616; 160-494-015-421-129; 161-182-820-450-575; 163-554-538-545-279; 167-898-313-243-880; 168-193-278-954-64X; 169-707-009-361-549; 181-306-809-476-587; 181-521-803-511-646; 182-900-736-824-779; 183-478-831-627-672; 185-528-250-340-53X; 189-080-398-097-428; 197-410-197-111-616; 198-774-640-872-545; 199-216-234-147-970,37

The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has emerged as a central issue in ecological sciences, but the impact of regarding hedgerow function as a potential source of biological control agents against agricultural pests remains poorly understood. In this paper, we assessed effects of the arthropod community in a neighbouring hedge on the distribution of the pest psylla, Cacopsylla pyri, in a pear orchard over three consecutive years (1999-2001). We measured the diversity of the arthropod community in the hedge and in the orchard at increasing distances from the hedge using Shannon index diversity. Other indices and statistics such the Hellinger and L1 distances were used to measure dissimilarities between spatial and temporal population distributions patterns. Our results showed in particular a decreasing diversity gradient as distance from the hedge increased and a convergence between predator populations in the orchard and the hedgerow during psylla proliferation. The beneficial arthropod exchanges occurring between the mixed hedgerow and the pear orchard during the pest proliferation period suggested that field border management could be used in an integrated pest management strategy aimed at reducing insecticide use.",37,2,75,83,Integrated pest management; Biodiversity; Ecology; Geography; PEST analysis; PEAR; Psylla; Orchard; Diversity index; Hedge,,,,,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=4266970 https://www.persee.fr/doc/ecmed_0153-8756_2011_num_37_2_1340,http://dx.doi.org/10.3406/ecmed.2011.1340,,10.3406/ecmed.2011.1340,322028552,,0,,1

Lerch; Keith W. Goyne; Harold E. Garrett,"Multiple species vegetative buffer strips (VBSs) have been recommended as a cost-effective approach to mitigate agrochemical transport in surface runoff derived from agronomic operations, while at the same time offering a broader range of long-term ecological and environmental benefits. However, the effect of VBS designs and species composition on reducing herbicide and veterinary antibiotic transport has not been well documented. An experiment consisting of three VBS designs and one continuous cultivated fallow control replicated in triplicate was conducted to assess effectiveness in reducing herbicide and antibiotic transport for claypan soils. The three VBS designs include (i) tall fescue, (ii) tall fescue with a switchgrass hedge barrier, and (iii) native vegetation (largely eastern gamagrass). Rainfall simulation was used to create uniform antecedent soil moisture content in the plots and to generate runoff. Our results suggested that all VBS significantly reduced the transport of dissolved and sediment-bound atrazine, metolachlor, and glyphosate in surface runoff by 58 to 72%. Four to 8 m of any tested VBS reduced dissolved sulfamethazine transport in the surface runoff by more than 70%. The tall fescue VBS was overall most effective at reducing dissolved tylosin and enrofloxacin transport in the runoff (>75%). The developed exponential regression models can be used to predict expected field-scale results and provide design criteria for effective field implementation of grass buffers. Our study has demonstrated that an optimized VBS design may achieve desired agrochemical reductions and minimize acreage removed from crop production.",40,3,791,799,Soil water; Metolachlor; Atrazine; Claypan; Glyphosate; Antibiotic transport; Environmental science; Veterinary medicine; Buffer strip; Surface runoff,,"Agriculture; Anti-Bacterial Agents/analysis; Biodegradation, Environmental; Environmental Pollution/prevention & control; Herbicides/analysis; Missouri; Models, Biological; Poaceae/growth & development; Regression Analysis; Soil Pollutants/analysis; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis","Anti-Bacterial Agents; Herbicides; Soil Pollutants; Water Pollutants, Chemical",U.S. Department of Agriculture,https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2010.0141 http://extension.missouri.edu/sare/documents/HerbicidesVeterinaryAntibiotics2012.pdf https://www.ars.usda.gov/sp2UserFiles/Place/36221500/cswq-0462-lin.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21546664 http://www.ars.usda.gov/sp2UserFiles/Place/36221500/cswq-0462-lin.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2010.0141,21546664,10.2134/jeq2010.0141,1986603684,,0,000-289-922-088-88X; 000-910-934-988-431; 003-426-515-376-697; 004-121-674-753-524; 010-937-125-100-781; 015-632-636-023-188; 017-397-083-522-184; 019-622-915-734-27X; 021-655-763-861-159; 024-575-904-332-090; 024-998-467-249-663; 030-682-084-703-597; 033-890-182-096-159; 040-200-945-556-057; 042-230-387-909-769; 049-259-412-291-969; 054-047-602-559-678; 054-526-183-942-91X; 055-743-080-717-004; 057-714-072-954-341; 060-359-271-469-167; 066-103-039-036-278; 070-250-108-369-602; 071-851-252-694-645; 082-288-017-131-032; 084-698-813-585-136; 097-842-842-667-70X; 105-004-879-644-099; 109-390-701-387-260; 121-517-163-561-953; 133-077-461-345-617; 133-363-147-232-814; 135-924-067-533-238; 138-752-648-302-05X; 142-092-889-852-638; 181-090-792-931-175,43

Denitrification in riparian buffer strips is thought to be the major process -with nitrate uptake by plant growth- that reduces nitrate input in surface water. We investigated the Denitrifier Enzyme Activity (DEA) to test how the buffer strip management modifies the denitrification process. The experimental site is composed of a crop field and a 11 m wide grassed buffer strip at the border between the crop field and a tributary to the Attert river, South-East Belgium. Soil samples from the crop field and the buffer strip have been submitted to different imposed conditions combining glucose, nitrate and water saturation to investigate how antecedent water regime, nitrate and carbon content affect denitrification. The work included DEA measurements on undisturbed soil cores freshly sampled. Experiments on undisturbed soil cores identify the buffer strip as more effective in denitrification (p < 0.001) than the cropped field. However, experiments on samples conditioned under imposed carbon and/or nitrate contents emphasised the importance of micro-topography.",,,,,Nonpoint source pollution; Nitrate; Riparian buffer; Water quality; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Soil test; Denitrification; Surface water; Environmental engineering,,,,,http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/bitstream/2268/94111/1/DenitrificationMArieCorsTychpntheme03_04.pdf https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/94111,http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/bitstream/2268/94111/1/DenitrificationMArieCorsTychpntheme03_04.pdf,,,2161318923,,0,007-288-893-953-570; 010-799-017-288-18X,0

Laubel; Brian Kronvang; A. B. Hald; C. Jensen,"Bank erosion was measured at 91 stream banks located in 15 Danish rural 1st and 2nd order streams over a 2-year period. Our aims were firstly to examine factors controlling spatial variation in bank erosion, secondly to estimate sediment and phosphorus (P) loss via bank erosion. The overall mean bank erosion rate was 11 mm year−1. Bank erosion rate over the 2-year period was significantly related to a number of site-specific characteristics, including bank angle, bank vegetation cover, overhanging bank and estimated stream power. An empirical model for bank erosion based on these descriptive variables yielded a 55% explanation of the observed spatial variation in bank erosion rate. Bank erosion was higher at the lower 50-cm bank section (20 mm year−1) than at the upper bank (6 mm year−1). Cattle fencing in grazed areas and buffer zones with riparian woodland lowered bank erosion rates. We found that total P content of bank material was high (0·64 g P kg−1) and at the same level as found in agricultural topsoil along the streams. The overall annual catchment loss of bank-derived clay–silt sediment and total P to streams amounted to 58–72 kg sediment ha−1 and 0·23–0·28 kg P ha−1, respectively. In comparison, the mean annual suspended sediment (SS) and total P losses from 14 similar sized Danish agricultural catchments were 122 kg SS ha−1 and 0·58 kg P ha−1 over the 2-year study period. Thus, bank erosion seems to be a major contributor of suspended sediment and P in this type of small channelized lowland stream.

Lizotte; Scott S. Knight; Martin A. Locke; Ronald L. Bingner,"Watershed-scale management efforts to improve conservation of water resources in agricultural watersheds depend upon the effectiveness of integrated multiple agricultural best management practices (BMPs). To more comprehensively assess the effectiveness of combined BMPs on water quality requires large-scale, long-term (>10 year) studies measuring key water quality parameters. One such suite of critical water quality parameters includes water clarity, total suspended solids (TSS), and total dissolved solids (TDS). To address this, Beasley Lake, a 25 ha (62 ac) oxbow lake located in a 915 ha (2,261 ac) watershed of intensive row crop agricultural activity, was studied. The lake was sediment impaired when monitoring was initiated in 1995 and was a candidate to assess the effectiveness of watershed-wide BMPs on lake water clarity (as Secchi depth), TSS concentrations, and TDS. A variety of BMPs within row crop fields, at field edges throughout the watershed, and enrollment of 112 ha (277 ac) into the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) between 1997 to 2006 focused on reducing soil erosion and concomitant sediment runoff. Selected parameters were measured approximately biweekly from 1996 to 2009. During this 14-year period, changes in row crop management and BMP implementations and alterations were observed and recorded in con- junction with targeted water quality parameters. While annual improvement in water quality occurred, distinct seasonal effects were noticeable. Observed changes in water clarity and TSS concentrations were greatest during spring and least in winter in association with increased BMPs, vegetated buffer strips west of the lake, and CRP north of the lake. Observed decreases in TDS concentrations were greatest during summer and fall in association with implemented CRP north of the lake. Reductions in spring TSS by >60% often directly increased spring water clarity by >100%. Results of this study indicate clear improvement in lake water quality with watershed-wide implementation of integrated multiple agricultural BMPs, and these improvements, manifested most strongly during spring, will assist to promote a healthy, sus- tainable lake ecosystem.",69,2,160,170,Total dissolved solids; Conservation agriculture; Watershed; Water resources; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science; Lake ecosystem; Buffer strip; Total suspended solids,,,,,https://www.jswconline.org/content/69/2/160.refs https://www.jswconline.org/content/69/2/160 https://www.jswconline.org/content/jswc/69/2/160.full.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.69.2.160,,10.2489/jswc.69.2.160,2124249704,,0,004-559-694-821-340; 006-380-597-316-505; 007-436-720-385-992; 007-790-562-507-65X; 008-120-672-306-879; 013-412-311-575-892; 013-943-215-025-48X; 015-918-647-709-568; 017-220-687-390-238; 020-919-363-740-980; 022-324-218-883-192; 022-441-748-412-622; 028-185-883-355-120; 030-682-084-703-597; 032-365-774-313-688; 035-363-182-923-44X; 036-115-352-954-286; 038-534-054-403-311; 041-196-524-629-972; 050-483-418-446-10X; 055-068-326-054-030; 056-817-181-693-297; 059-283-083-806-230; 073-466-436-859-274; 085-350-602-480-245; 086-368-078-083-965; 086-999-181-942-474; 098-288-295-728-93X; 112-956-606-481-708; 116-434-350-458-500; 139-498-603-333-130; 144-279-645-115-466; 149-753-631-985-687; 153-342-753-204-373; 169-607-559-923-667; 171-642-238-016-295; 184-584-294-595-294; 192-109-014-802-680; 193-077-157-775-184,16

Coyne; R. A. Gilfillen; Robert L. Blevins,"Adding carbon-rich materials to fields, like manure, may enhance denitrification. Grass filters which are used to trap surface runoff from these fields, may also provide a carbon-rich environment that favors water infiltration and denitrification. Nitrous oxide (N{sub 2}O) may be evolved in these settings. It is a radiatively important trace gas and intermediate in the denitrification pathway and several other microbial processes. We measured N{sub 2}O flux, after simulated rain, using a soil cover technique in poultry-manured plots and grass filters receiving their runoff. Intact soil cores were used to relate the N{sub 2}O flux to the denitrification potential of the plots. Nitrous oxide fluxes were smaller in grass filters than in manured plots, even though more denitrifying bacteria were present. The average N{sub 2}O flux in the three most dynamic erosion plots was 755 {mu}g N{sub 2}O-N m{sup -2}h{sup -1}, which was 39% of the maximal denitrification rate measured in acetylene-blocked, NO{sub 3}{sup -}-amended soil cores.

Márquez; Víctor J. García; Cynthia A. Cambardella; Richard C. Schultz; Thomas M. Isenhart,"A new theoretical and experimental framework that permits an accurate determination of aggregate-size stability distribution is presented. The size-stability distribution in addition to estimating aggregate-size distribution distinguishes between amounts of stable and unstable macroaggregates (>250 μm). The determination of aggregate-size stability distribution involves the assumptions that soil aggregates can be categorized in terms of their size and water stability (slaking resistance). Experimentally this procedure involves the slaked and capillary-wetted pretreatmeats; and a subsequent slaking treatment of aggregates >250 μm in size. We also propose the stable aggregates index (SAT) and the stable macroaggregates index (SMal) for studying soil stability based on aggregate resistance to staking. These indices account for the total weighted average of stable aggregates and the total weighted average of stable macroaggregates, respectively. Both the SAI and the SMaI indices were shown to be sensitive to the effects of vegetation on soil stability under different riparian buffer communities. The SAI and the SMaI indices were higher in surface soils under cool-season grass than any of the other treatments. These soils samples are well aggregated with SAI = 74% and SMal = 56% followed by SAI = 55% and SMaI = 37% under existing riparian forest, SAI = 40% and SMaI = 21% under 7-yr switchgrass and SAI = 36% and SMal = 18% under cropped system.",68,3,725,735,Loam; Soil structure; Riparian forest; Soil science; Soil water; SmaI; Mathematics; Stability (probability); Aggregate (composite); Mollisol,,,,,https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/sssaj/abstracts/68/3/725 https://works.bepress.com/richard_schultz/29/download/ https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2136/sssaj2004.7250 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1178&context=nrem_pubs https://works.bepress.com/richard_schultz/29/ https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SSASJ..68..725M/abstract https://core.ac.uk/display/38936629 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/nrem_pubs/178/ https://core.ac.uk/download/38936629.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2004.7250,,10.2136/sssaj2004.7250,2061744850,,0,014-026-509-704-03X; 014-345-758-321-652; 016-835-768-298-85X; 031-231-388-927-403; 033-763-281-823-268; 045-828-189-511-368; 046-043-670-657-650; 051-217-616-458-480; 054-292-788-964-67X; 056-169-066-366-677; 056-214-180-223-83X; 064-656-493-555-374; 080-788-326-614-204; 101-012-916-569-644; 104-055-337-412-975; 127-785-284-544-120; 130-784-279-171-773; 133-003-771-599-522; 138-982-129-144-858; 153-693-783-633-771,137

Eybert; P. Constant; Jean-Claude Lefeuvre,"The effects of a land consolidation project were studied in an agricultural landscape in Brittany on the foraging habitats, breeding parameters and factors causing breeding failure of the linnet Acanthis cannabina L. The study covered five breeding seasons before land consolidation and another five afterwards. The project involved the disappearance of more than 50% of the hedgerows, and about 30% of the meadows and fallow lands were replaced by cultivation.; ; Before land consolidation, breeding success was mainly affected by density-dependent factors, whereas afterwards density-independent factors such as weather or disease played an important role.; ; The preferred feeding sites remained the same during the whole study period; fallow lands, rape fields and meadows were selected positively but cereal and potato fields were avoided. This characteristic became more apparent after land consolidation, because it involved a reduction in the feeding areas of the linnet.; ; Numbers of eggs per clutch, hatchlings and fledglings were unaffected but fledging and breeding success of the first brood increased significantly during this period. Predation, which was the main cause of egg loss and nestling mortality, decreased significantly after land consolidation, through loss of hedges used as movement corridors by some specialist predators. The increase in the distance between breeding site and foraging area probably reduced the time spent by adults on their nests, leaving nestlings unprotected.",74,3,195,202,Brood; Agriculture; Foraging; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Land consolidation; Population; Fledge; Biology,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006320795000308 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006320795000308,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-3207(95)00030-8,,10.1016/0006-3207(95)00030-8,2085009338,,0,014-419-926-825-753; 014-752-194-949-097; 015-787-419-698-804; 023-343-562-467-77X; 024-087-506-435-059; 026-590-504-052-311; 027-578-589-369-047; 029-904-475-177-008; 034-586-373-885-10X; 041-613-481-292-816; 042-344-738-534-328; 047-000-620-546-182; 047-629-763-761-275; 053-613-714-373-971; 056-476-847-664-597; 072-224-176-896-782; 072-992-416-725-854; 075-552-117-981-903; 078-326-083-386-180; 117-119-858-150-626; 118-882-035-108-801; 125-783-335-875-543; 125-956-370-229-291; 149-710-858-184-630; 176-863-752-876-897; 192-171-445-302-263,27

After hand sorting the larger arthropods, the small ones were extracted with a modified MacFadyen apparatus.; ; The abundance of arthropods in the arable fields was significantly lower than in the adjacent semi-natural habitats. Highest abundances and species diversities were found in a sown wildflower strip, a hedge, a permanent meadow and a meadow under the cherry trees of the organic farm. With a total of 90 arthropod species in the semi-natural habitats, five times more species were found than in the arable fields.

Facey; Marc S. Botham; Matthew S. Heard; Richard F. Pywell; Joanna T. Staley,"1. Hedgerows provide an important habitat for wildlife including invertebrates, representing a large proportion of semi-natural habitat patches in the modern agricultural landscapes of the UK and Europe. Around 40% of hedgerow length in England is managed under agri-environment scheme (AES) options, which specify less frequent cutting and advise cutting in winter.; 2. Hedgerow management can alter habitat structure and quality, potentially influencing invertebrate community structure. We assessed the impacts of management treatments on moth communities and their parasitoids. Two treatments (‘cutting frequency’: once every 1, 2, or 3 years, and ‘cutting time’: autumn vs. winter) were applied to a long-running hedgerow experiment, mimicking AES prescriptions. Moth larvae were collected from the hedgerows, identified and reared to determine parasitism. Hedgerow structure and foliar quality were quantified and related to changes in moth abundance, diversity, species richness, and parasitism.; 3. Hedgerow management did not significantly affect overall abundance of moth larvae, but did affect the abundance of certain feeding guilds and trophic interactions with parasitoids. Concealed moth larvae (mining, tentiform, and case bearing) were more abundant on hedgerows cut infrequently (every 2 or 3 years vs. annually). Parasitism rates were higher on hedgerows cut less often, when these were cut in autumn. There was a strong trend towards greater moth species richness and diversity on winter cut hedgerows.; 4. Agri-environment scheme management can thus have complex effects on invertebrate communities. The abundance of some moths may be positively affected by AES hedgerow management and this can have knock-on effects on parasitoid abundance.",7,6,543,552,Community structure; Invertebrate; Habitat; Ecology; Parasitism; Wildlife; Species richness; Agronomy; Trophic level; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,"Natural Environment Research Council; Natural Environment Research Council; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/icad.12077 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sarah_Facey/publication/262150929_Moth_communities_and_agri-environment_schemes_Examining_the_effects_of_hedgerow_cutting_regime_on_diversity_abundance_and_parasitism/links/554bf5350cf29f836c98f437.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/20539040.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.12077,,10.1111/icad.12077,2039994160,,0,000-103-713-547-965; 004-285-360-733-433; 004-851-850-013-053; 006-086-255-921-425; 006-314-244-124-537; 009-263-421-936-141; 013-146-093-850-278; 014-474-574-603-445; 016-421-756-148-512; 017-390-505-331-643; 020-024-935-817-641; 022-321-534-473-933; 022-438-869-235-426; 034-662-603-831-951; 035-766-091-810-403; 035-841-616-763-329; 038-771-978-452-091; 042-303-914-852-499; 048-865-564-414-124; 052-951-584-268-481; 053-002-848-047-394; 054-190-974-057-937; 055-083-398-263-398; 055-946-607-021-418; 057-283-401-649-275; 061-266-379-556-653; 066-233-762-211-691; 074-786-761-207-084; 075-813-896-905-215; 078-318-665-214-047; 082-871-615-425-848; 088-470-568-990-908; 095-742-241-188-104; 097-095-789-567-42X; 100-280-981-956-979; 102-366-533-082-155; 102-694-489-949-18X; 109-937-587-021-762; 113-711-894-515-431; 120-993-169-075-447; 126-812-080-751-085; 128-580-521-335-849; 132-445-253-556-970; 133-858-248-195-498; 138-845-934-876-76X; 167-169-560-672-690; 169-441-328-542-499; 176-160-239-279-783; 187-107-567-108-154; 191-836-055-870-481; 196-107-021-207-181,16

Villalba; Robert L. Blevins,"Land application of poultry wastes in Kentucky will increase as the broiler industry grows. If poultry manure stimulates N 2 O loss from soil it will reduce the fertilizer N value of this waste. In contrast, stimulated N 2 O loss in grass filter strips receiving the runoff from manured fields could help reduce contamination of surface water by NO 3 - . Our objectives were to determine (i) if poultry manure stimulated N 2 O loss in soil after rainfall and (ii) if there was an edge-of-field effect on N 2 O loss in grass filters intercepting runoff from amended soil. Soil covers were used to measure N 2 O loss from a well-drained, poultry manure-amended, silt loam soil immediately after simulated rainfall and were also used to measure N 2 O loss from grass filters intercepting their surface runoff. Nitrous oxide loss from manure-amended soil was greater than from unamended controls and ranged from 5 to 13 mg N 2 O-N m -2 h -1 . The maximum N 2 O loss was equivalent to 3.2 kg N 2 O-N ha -1 d -1 . Nitrous oxide loss from grass filters intercepting runoff ranged from 0.1 to 1.4 mg N 2 O-N m -2 h -1 and was significantly greater than portions of the grass filters that did not intercept runoff. Nitrous oxide loss from poultry manure-amended soils was greater than N 2 O loss typically measured from waste-amended agricultural soils.

Besnard; Jean Secondi,"Hay meadows and hedgerows have been declining for decades in Western Europe. Conservation policies promote their protection but agri-environmental measures for both can be implemented in the same area, possibly generating loss of efficiency. We recorded grassland passerine abundance in 99 sampling plots distributed in hay meadow habitat. Sampling plots were located across a gradient of hedgerow density in a floodplain system. As expected, abundance and species richness increased with grassland area. More importantly, hedgerow density was negatively related to both response variables when grassland area was controlled for. This result is important for habitat management. Subsidizing agri-environmental measures for hedgerows and grassland is of interest for biodiversity, but incompatibility between measures may occur at the parcel scale if one landscape component (hedges) splits another component (meadows) down to the suitability threshold for grassland species. To optimize the payoffs of subsidies, it can be effective and efficient to manage agri-environmental schemes at the landscape scale.",189,,21,27,Biodiversity; Floodplain; Habitat; Fragmentation (computing); Geography; Grassland; Lowland semi-natural grassland; Species richness; Agroforestry; Abundance (ecology),,,,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5324076 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880914001339 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880914001339,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2014.03.014,,10.1016/j.agee.2014.03.014,2037564404,,0,003-510-625-031-181; 004-319-749-247-532; 011-287-863-694-168; 011-616-152-556-150; 011-764-481-977-911; 016-421-756-148-512; 019-925-489-194-685; 020-085-309-984-708; 022-989-871-663-009; 024-701-098-390-660; 025-080-908-649-206; 026-044-630-843-87X; 026-811-290-453-561; 029-469-527-514-165; 030-647-324-594-171; 031-131-769-758-182; 031-592-787-048-258; 035-290-646-705-893; 035-600-593-568-784; 036-719-713-207-241; 042-523-280-232-89X; 044-623-321-549-254; 047-771-878-783-607; 049-557-478-030-177; 051-685-596-945-405; 051-865-427-302-095; 052-350-677-816-754; 053-610-588-827-085; 053-809-496-122-043; 055-032-125-212-747; 056-099-523-856-735; 073-414-667-013-028; 073-798-803-161-275; 081-079-241-577-568; 086-853-909-463-07X; 105-784-720-626-585; 120-514-812-606-235; 125-911-616-777-361; 134-019-355-927-817; 134-875-712-461-130; 136-051-903-791-205; 144-063-749-131-775; 144-956-293-832-714; 147-876-967-620-283; 153-068-280-635-43X; 154-208-298-751-832; 156-624-196-949-616; 156-916-822-646-642; 159-938-497-832-818; 169-677-859-853-22X; 179-402-327-063-059; 187-050-769-304-212; 195-618-519-387-640,21

Feber; Philip Riordan; Martin C. Townsend; Nigel A.D. Bourn; Mark S. Parsons; David W. Macdonald,"How best to optimize the biodiversity gain from agri-environment schemes (AES) has recently been identified as a key policy-relevant question. Here, the effects of two features of lowland agricultural landscapes on the abundance and diversity of larger moths are contrasted. Although both features bring about positive effects, hedgerow trees have a larger impact than 6 m wide grassy field margins. Whilst AES payments are given to create and maintain grass margins, no financial reward is currently offered for the retention of hedgerow trees. Furthermore, it was only in areas where the amount of land under AES was experimentally increased, by targeting farmers, that the presence of hedgerow trees resulted in a substantially higher abundance (+60%) and diversity (+38%) of moths. Thus, by using larger moths as bio-indicators of landscape-scale quality, it is demonstrated that improvements to the cost-effectiveness of AES could be achieved, firstly, by providing more appropriate financial rewards to farmers for different landscape features, and secondly, through landscape-scale targeting of farmers to encourage participation in AES. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Greenwood; Jon S. Harding; Dev K. Niyogi; Angus R. McIntosh,"Summary 1. Riparian management has been embraced by water and land managers globally to offset the deleterious effects of intensive agricultural land use on aquatic ecosystems. However, the documented responses of stream communities to riparian management have been variable, particularly in highly degraded systems. 2. We used boosted regression trees and structural equation models to assess the effects of riparian condition and stream size on the invertebrate communities of 64 agricultural waterways on the Canterbury Plains, New Zealand. We hypothesized that small streams would be more degraded than larger waterways but would show a greater increase in the abundance of pollution-sensitive aquatic invertebrates in response to riparian management. We also predicted that land-use legacies of poor in-stream habitat would reduce the effectiveness of current riparian management. The two strongest determinants of community structure were primarily in-stream habitat, where sedimentation and low water velocity had negative impacts on stream communities, and stream size, with smaller waterways generally more impacted than large waterways. Not surprisingly, with >150 years of agriculture and patchy riparian management on the plains, current management has not greatly improved in-stream habitat and thus had little effect on the abundance of sensitive aquatic insect (EPT) taxa. 3. Managed streams did, however, have more pollution-sensitive communities in general. This was largely mediated by decreased stream temperature, narrower ⁄ deeper channels and greater organic matter resources in streams with riparian planting and restricted stock access. Thus, if water velocity and sedimentation issues can be mitigated, then riparian management should become more effective. 4. Synthesis and applications. Within the context of a degraded agricultural landscape, we identified factors limiting the effectiveness of riparian management for stream invertebrate communities. Riparian management should primarily target and protect small streams and those without degraded in-stream habitat. Intensive management, such as in-stream habitat or channel morphology modification, may be needed to address historical factors (e.g. low velocity and sedimentation), which otherwise may continue to limit community recovery.",49,1,213,222,Land degradation; Riparian zone; Aquatic ecosystem; Habitat; Ecology; Environmental science; Land use; Agricultural land; Restoration ecology; Landscape ecology,,,,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02092.x%4010.1111/%28ISSN%291365-2656.FRESHWATER http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02092.x/abstract https://scholarsmine.mst.edu/biosci_facwork/223/ https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02092.x https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02092.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02092.x%4010.1111/%28ISSN%291365-2435.FRESHWATER https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02092.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02092.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02092.x,2112225879,,0,000-302-332-875-297; 001-119-833-238-908; 001-699-479-136-901; 002-239-487-029-857; 004-197-813-891-486; 006-743-390-664-481; 008-276-010-849-381; 010-670-305-123-42X; 013-367-327-282-701; 015-031-207-682-544; 015-256-006-013-114; 018-200-676-614-484; 021-207-457-184-365; 022-479-744-247-184; 022-989-733-515-50X; 024-125-558-121-048; 026-988-011-549-709; 030-718-641-328-198; 033-766-715-903-569; 034-124-984-251-636; 037-060-401-034-007; 041-814-374-999-489; 046-368-918-746-231; 047-825-554-899-487; 052-306-657-152-534; 052-583-140-294-949; 067-367-059-017-184; 069-248-024-101-416; 070-001-765-983-621; 086-685-350-382-999; 095-483-804-128-84X; 096-196-209-039-855; 096-992-699-821-977; 110-273-471-720-293; 121-178-085-490-606; 125-859-662-791-556; 126-051-201-417-566; 128-107-067-690-029; 147-317-912-994-359; 149-520-541-575-986; 154-204-104-510-021; 189-738-474-429-219,52

For all land uses most of the root biomass was within the 0–20 cm depth range. Total coarse root biomass, to a 60 cm depth, ranged from 8.8-73.7 t/ha in woodlots, 0.6-1.3 t/ha in herbaceous buffers, and 9.2-27.3 t/ha in poplars. Total fine root biomass ranged from 2.68-8.64 t/ha in woodlots, 2.60-3.29 t/ha in herbaceous buffers, and 1.86-2.62 t/ha in poplars. Total root biomass was similar or higher in poplar buffers compared to a 27 year-old grey birch forest. This indicates that poplar buffers accelerated riparian soil colonisation by roots compared to natural secondary succession. Generally, fine root biomass in the surface soil (0–20 cm) was lower in poplar than in herbaceous buffers; the reverse was observed at greater depth. Highest coarse root biomass in the 40–60 cm depth range was observed in a poplar buffer, highlighting the deep rooted nature of poplars. On average, total soil C stocks (0–60 cm) were greater in woodlots than in riparian buffers. On most sites, soil C stocks tended to be lower in poplar buffers compared to adjacent herbaceous buffers, especially in surface soil, probably because of lower fine root biomass in poplar buffers. Across all sites and land uses, highest soil C stocks at the different soil depths were found in the soil layers of woodlots that also had the greatest fine root biomass. Strong positive linear relationships between fine root biomass and soil C stocks in the 0–20 cm depth range (R; 2 = 0.79, p < 0.001), and in the whole soil profile (0–60 cm) (R; 2 = 0.65, p < 0.01), highlight the central role of fine root biomass in maintaining or increasing soil C stocks.",2,1,539,539,Riparian zone; Growing season; Soil horizon; Secondary succession; Biomass; Herbaceous plant; Environmental science; Soil carbon; Afforestation; Botany; Agronomy,Afforestation; Agriculture; Agroforestry; Coarse roots; Fine roots; Land use; Vertical distribution,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-1801-2-539 https://paperity.org/p/35111723/root-biomass-and-soil-carbon-distribution-in-hybrid-poplar-riparian-buffers-herbaceous https://core.ac.uk/display/81616568 http://www.springerplus.com/content/pdf/2193-1801-2-539.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24255839/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3825063/ https://springerplus.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/2193-1801-2-539 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F2193-1801-2-539.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/MED/24255839,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2193-1801-2-539,24255839,10.1186/2193-1801-2-539,2123579715,PMC3825063,0,000-933-635-218-121; 001-305-907-783-327; 001-798-029-408-352; 002-848-247-970-406; 002-906-059-248-902; 002-937-270-631-538; 005-222-102-566-554; 011-039-983-900-576; 013-219-581-451-545; 013-222-574-071-605; 017-699-636-561-196; 019-161-085-135-50X; 023-518-218-868-082; 025-751-077-629-320; 026-544-151-892-560; 026-547-241-118-45X; 027-198-925-201-768; 029-786-344-973-990; 032-538-020-373-150; 032-811-819-118-788; 035-700-233-495-76X; 037-681-075-428-749; 038-659-320-814-260; 043-581-644-882-941; 043-629-429-159-697; 045-638-711-190-580; 046-822-994-663-953; 046-880-307-214-925; 055-186-770-481-319; 056-448-774-024-709; 058-931-650-286-179; 060-141-498-715-228; 061-049-610-938-689; 063-963-834-687-484; 073-964-591-349-866; 077-129-148-016-65X; 084-449-369-648-999; 085-416-058-763-960; 089-311-079-759-973; 089-714-128-921-145; 091-775-007-622-713; 095-646-738-104-578; 101-012-916-569-644; 101-708-903-831-178; 103-398-831-024-992; 116-605-114-400-271; 124-766-514-685-103; 125-053-561-086-476; 127-023-971-312-961; 127-785-284-544-120; 128-187-888-119-092; 131-798-210-271-569; 132-336-506-518-348; 132-774-366-611-830; 144-106-354-797-123; 144-469-501-661-481; 148-460-004-368-465; 155-683-331-775-019; 161-917-786-725-591; 181-444-175-324-471; 192-206-873-161-767; 196-381-785-440-137,20

Smiley; F. Douglas Shields; Scott S. Knight,"Conservation practices are regularly implemented within agricultural watersheds throughout the United States without evaluating their ecological impacts. Impact assessments documenting how habitat and aquatic biota within streams respond to these practices are needed for evaluating the effects of conservation practices. Numerous sampling protocols have been developed for monitoring streams. However, protocols designed for monitoring studies are not appropriate for impact assessments. We developed guiding principles for designing impact assessments of ecological responses to conservation practices. The guiding principles are as fol- lows: (1) develop the hypothesis first, (2) use replicated experimental designs having controls and treatments, (3) assess the habitat and biological characteristics with quantitative and repeatable sampling methods, (4) use multiple sampling techniques for collecting aquatic organisms, and (5) standardize sampling efforts for aquatic organisms. The guiding principles were applied in designing a study intended to evaluate the influence of herba- ceous riparian buffers on channelized headwater streams in central Ohio. Our example highlights that the application of our recommendations will result in impact assessments that are hypothesis-driven and incorpo- rate quantitative methods for the measurement of abiotic and biotic attributes.

However, these schemes require evaluation to estimate their efficiency, for further consolidation and improvement. The establishment of grassy strips along watercourses represents a measure of cross-compliance introduced in France in 2005. In this study, we analyzed the benefits of these new landscape elements for biodiversity, by (i) exploring the plant community composition of grassy strips in relation to their landscape context, (ii) analyzing the faunal communities of three major functional groups (i.e., small mammals, syrphids, and carabid beetles) present in grassy strips of agroecosystems, (iii) comparing the faunal biodiversity to that observed in other habitats of agroecosystems, such as fields and hedgerows, and (iv) investigating the relationships between faunal community indices and grassy strip properties. The results of our study showed that the plant community of grassy strips is mainly influenced by semi-natural habitats that are present within a landscape context, i.e., at a scale >500 m. We found that grassy strips do not necessarily present areas of particularly high animal biodiversity compared to other habitats (i.e., fields and hedgerows). However, the properties of these strips (i.e., length, width and plant biodiversity) influence the structure of faunal communities. Two years after the establishment of grassy strips, their role as ecotones between previous field margins (mostly hedgerows in our study site) is illustrated through the response of the fauna. Hence, grassy strips, being more stable than cultivated fields, contribute to a new refuge within the agroecosystem landscape.",166,,15,27,Fauna; Biodiversity; Habitat; Ecology; Ecotone; Geography; Beneficial insects; European union; Plant community; Agroforestry; Agroecosystem,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880912002642 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880912002642,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2012.07.004,,10.1016/j.agee.2012.07.004,2089712263,,0,000-240-239-990-548; 000-706-796-635-17X; 004-022-348-071-073; 006-308-525-460-894; 007-871-326-224-951; 008-225-619-668-580; 008-777-165-646-699; 011-162-095-263-090; 011-672-108-275-761; 011-789-039-750-846; 012-247-538-497-064; 012-357-805-545-268; 013-096-083-292-716; 020-610-220-757-448; 021-456-573-673-200; 023-251-810-309-271; 023-360-149-157-668; 024-744-163-026-022; 027-540-280-426-898; 030-388-440-825-295; 030-453-266-652-445; 031-114-644-626-51X; 034-366-554-328-48X; 036-511-884-406-410; 037-002-778-558-737; 038-618-402-954-434; 039-931-152-932-802; 040-863-991-027-524; 041-469-176-773-812; 042-749-789-102-563; 044-531-648-558-840; 045-806-064-594-473; 046-500-604-745-231; 049-847-857-286-223; 050-224-806-567-10X; 050-229-016-868-066; 051-197-969-663-775; 054-715-078-148-813; 055-054-076-410-76X; 055-083-398-263-398; 056-979-258-730-423; 057-332-914-601-179; 058-011-278-535-092; 061-967-232-577-128; 063-426-464-521-853; 065-985-181-262-074; 070-194-102-378-889; 072-090-852-140-219; 072-170-722-254-058; 073-359-404-037-66X; 074-068-982-114-504; 074-793-529-288-006; 075-336-397-615-388; 075-409-586-145-383; 077-396-195-490-895; 078-960-284-587-139; 080-348-794-816-190; 080-506-366-738-457; 092-228-898-297-400; 095-877-317-702-391; 099-188-994-062-936; 111-085-619-662-631; 111-628-243-264-528; 113-225-847-396-026; 114-646-769-502-277; 119-352-383-206-342; 125-357-678-676-499; 126-903-252-358-903; 127-747-168-852-33X; 130-202-097-914-836; 135-630-136-231-708; 135-883-559-011-411; 141-273-200-926-50X; 144-700-882-404-647; 145-176-906-866-327; 148-789-623-443-683; 150-325-162-873-23X; 153-953-890-806-330; 155-691-175-864-748; 159-118-144-919-455; 169-066-269-448-571; 169-297-520-424-667; 184-257-981-904-628; 186-366-535-751-970; 186-739-979-596-835; 187-603-367-498-373; 188-468-956-254-948; 196-882-208-161-504,25

In the year before the experiment, in 1991, the apple aphids Dysaphis plantaginea (Pass.) and Aphis pomi (DeGeer) and aphidophagous predators were homogenously distributed in the orchard. In April 1992, weed strips were sown between tree rows and along the border parallel to the first and the last row of trees in one part (the other part served as control). In both parts of the orchard, randomly chosen trees were controlled visually in weekly intervals in 1992 and 1993. During flowering of weeds more aphidophagous predators were observed on the apple trees within the strip-sown area than in the control area. The most abundant and permanent aphidophagous predators were spiders, predaceous Heteroptera, Coccinellidae, and Chrysopidae. Both species of aphids were significantly less abundant in the area with weed strips than in the control area during the vegetation period. The effects of the weed strips on aphidophagous predators, and those of predators on aphids, are discussed.",75,1,43,49,Biological pest control; Predation; Weed; Chrysopidae; Homoptera; Aphis pomi; Orchard; Coccinellidae; Botany; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1995.tb01908.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1995.tb01908.x,,10.1111/j.1570-7458.1995.tb01908.x,1974455970,,0,006-265-437-533-574; 006-866-033-504-842; 009-434-480-017-042; 018-174-584-116-166; 021-199-110-991-742; 021-211-807-085-845; 025-446-079-138-022; 031-963-717-245-045; 072-817-046-222-302; 075-974-000-740-225; 114-630-686-106-424; 136-384-326-903-160; 163-610-168-562-867,121

The main reason for the lack of success of AES is considered to be their low ecological quality and insufficient area. Understanding the effects of different management strategies on the ecological quality of AES is therefore important. Here, we investigate the relationship between breeding bird density and species richness and the age of sown field margins, a widely used type of AES, in southwestern Switzerland. Territories of breeding birds were mapped on 67 field margins between 2004 and 2011. Territory densities (for eight species) and species richness were analysed in relation to age of the field margin. A general negative correlation between size of the field margin and territory density indicated that territory density was higher when the birds could forage in adjacent cultivated land. Territory densities and species richness increased up to an age of 4–6 years after sowing, depending on the species, and declined thereafter. The results suggest that the co-occurrence of newly sown margins and margins over 3 years old will have a positive effect on breeding bird densities and species diversity.",155,4,779,791,Forage (honey bee); Field (geography); Sowing; Ecology; Geography; Set-aside; Negative correlation; Cultivated land; Species richness; Species diversity,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ibi.12072/full https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ibi.12072,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.12072,,10.1111/ibi.12072,2035200474,,0,001-760-813-322-022; 002-845-097-888-509; 004-010-787-386-28X; 004-359-808-503-708; 005-170-676-904-856; 006-545-720-817-552; 007-416-181-403-689; 014-630-972-063-626; 015-532-756-399-78X; 015-691-707-399-917; 016-421-756-148-512; 017-786-901-727-296; 018-028-975-115-624; 018-352-146-661-534; 020-167-621-399-502; 020-652-008-679-636; 022-667-644-785-266; 023-103-648-255-011; 025-173-978-983-077; 026-527-744-858-38X; 031-188-996-161-21X; 031-206-874-111-261; 031-592-787-048-258; 037-002-778-558-737; 044-307-871-990-779; 045-088-035-767-327; 049-771-162-087-705; 059-649-458-440-049; 064-454-510-982-621; 068-452-604-669-157; 070-314-903-562-073; 070-582-747-582-275; 073-356-085-087-083; 075-813-896-905-215; 077-277-772-557-227; 085-668-122-415-751; 086-098-672-045-008; 093-835-124-539-323; 095-014-169-963-827; 097-362-331-074-408; 102-954-311-394-795; 107-532-685-702-969; 108-606-742-009-569; 109-759-036-269-420; 131-060-331-668-772; 145-728-200-767-581; 150-356-700-290-587; 161-300-804-429-199; 167-175-414-731-307; 169-754-255-995-936; 170-860-112-949-62X; 178-411-469-458-660; 194-734-770-739-898; 197-392-866-862-614,14

Displacement and speed of Pterostichus melanarius, Carabus auratus and Poecilus spp. were higher in the crops than in the grassy strips, except for the speed of C. auratus. Among the four species C. auratus, P. melanarius, Pterostichus niger, and Poecilus spp., C. auratus revealed the highest displacement and speed, whereas no significant differences were found between the other three species. P. melanarius showed higher displacement and speed in wheat than in red-clover or pumpkin. Speed and displacement of P. melanarius differed between spring and autumn generations in wheat or red-clover. When they were released at a junction of arable crop and field strips, C. auratus moved indifferently to either arable field or field margins/strips, whereas P. melanarius moved directly to crop centres. At the field margin, Poecilus spp. preferred to move along a grassy strip, while it moved irrespective from the grassy strips in a central site. C. nemoralis and P. niger preferred to move within the grassy strips. Our studies reveal that grassy strips do not affect the dispersal of typical arable field species; however, the species demanding grass vegetation can only overcome the barriers of arable fields either by grassy strips alone or by grassy strips with an adjacent hedge.",18,3,457,467,Organic farming; Biodiversity; Crop; Vegetation; Ecology; Poecilus; Carabus auratus; Animal ecology; Agroforestry; Agronomy; Arable land; Biology,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10841-014-9657-1 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10841-014-9657-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-014-9657-1,,10.1007/s10841-014-9657-1,1967980667,,0,005-108-075-665-872; 006-209-416-467-452; 008-819-122-488-603; 009-289-978-013-534; 010-888-549-334-33X; 013-963-655-119-437; 015-461-257-290-872; 019-657-415-295-733; 019-658-253-028-863; 020-331-636-713-391; 022-070-333-305-083; 026-969-752-606-914; 030-049-284-492-639; 030-652-847-337-20X; 041-705-614-633-513; 046-738-561-138-895; 047-711-433-977-172; 053-235-277-663-130; 058-105-561-757-413; 060-382-423-252-027; 063-420-855-837-663; 069-622-233-079-646; 077-277-772-557-227; 078-212-331-185-682; 078-720-513-189-167; 085-036-128-487-259; 087-186-786-234-321; 091-329-166-565-795; 092-286-036-576-532; 093-255-909-243-759; 097-350-855-406-92X; 099-188-994-062-936; 102-709-792-103-67X; 104-041-676-491-551; 106-595-024-453-59X; 108-617-736-483-655; 108-803-067-952-141; 109-407-548-674-770; 118-626-208-662-593; 134-077-810-366-536; 137-306-932-028-186; 140-515-077-339-088; 142-547-556-180-595; 155-470-146-363-603; 172-907-036-981-609; 185-440-624-510-69X; 191-245-265-713-754; 194-956-994-017-046,15

Cable,"Abstract Shelterbelts on the Great Plains have changed the landscape of the region. A common belief exists that this change has added aesthetic value to the landscape; however, this has not been scientifically documented. This study assessed the scenic beauty of shelterbelts. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine the relationship among shelterbelts, other landscape characteristics, and scenic beauty, (2) determine differences in scenic beauty judgments based on background characteristics of the observers, and (3) determine if scenic beauty judgments remained the same over two separate viewings of the same scenes by the same observers. One hundred and eighty students viewed 60 slides of plains landscapes with and without shelterbelts. Twenty-four viewers saw the slides twice. Viewers were asked to rate the slides for scenic beauty on a scale of 0 (low) to 9 (high). They also answered demographic and background characteristic questions. The scenic beauty scores were scaled to form Scenic Beauty Estimates. Simple correlation and multiple regression were used to analyze the data. Findings show that shelterbelts contribute to scenic beauty in the plains landscape, viewers' background characteristics do not affect scenic beauty ratings, and scenic beauty evaluations remain consistent over a repeat viewing.",32,1,63,69,Aesthetics; Windbreak; Geography; Beauty; Aesthetic value; Simple correlation,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016920469400171X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0169-2046(94)00171-x,,10.1016/0169-2046(94)00171-x,2054448194,,0,009-339-732-643-379; 010-580-572-028-663; 018-585-408-343-868; 020-452-334-946-780; 023-276-737-476-508; 024-349-630-562-669; 029-780-439-522-482; 033-074-361-863-557; 036-347-384-107-500; 045-194-178-485-035; 045-891-184-020-211; 048-184-176-726-894; 054-294-085-803-510; 055-657-896-816-08X; 064-157-508-014-006; 081-599-307-585-122; 084-054-822-048-195; 086-587-418-264-210; 091-406-170-126-572; 125-628-857-290-235; 151-583-760-533-209; 194-649-494-036-793,54

Gilley; Dean E. Eisenhauer; Paul J. Jasa; Alan L. Boldt,"The benefits of grass barriers or hedges for reducing offsite transport of non-point-source water pollutants from croplands are well recognized, but their ancillary benefits on soil properties have received less attention. We studied the 15-yr cumulative effects of narrow and perennial switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) barriers on soil organic C (SOC), total N, particulate organic matter (POM), and associated soil structural properties as compared with the cropped area on an Aksarben silty clay loam (fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Argiudoll) with 5.4% slope in eastern Nebraska. Five switchgrass barriers were established in 1998 at ∼38-m intervals parallel to the crop rows in a field under a conventional tillage and no-till grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]–corn (Zea mays L.) rotation. Compared with the cropped area, switchgrass barriers accumulated about 0.85 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ of SOC and 80 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ of total soil N at the 0 to 15 cm soil depth. Switchgrass barriers also increased coarse POM by 60%. Mean weight diameter of water-stable aggregates increased by 70% at 0 to 15 cm and by 40% at 15 to 60 cm, indicating that switchgrass barriers improved soil aggregation at deeper depths. Large (4.75–8 mm) macroaggregates under switchgrass barriers contained 30% more SOC than those under the cropped area. Switchgrass-induced changes in SOC concentration were positively associated with aggregate stability (r = 0.89***) and porosity (r = 0.47*). Overall, switchgrass barriers integrated with intensively managed agroecosystems can increase the SOC pool and improve soil structural properties.",106,6,2185,2192,Loam; Crop; Perennial plant; Sorghum; Panicum virgatum; Conventional tillage; Environmental science; Soil carbon; Agroecosystem; Agronomy,,,,,https://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/61131 https://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND600061131 https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/biosysengfacpub/429/ https://core.ac.uk/display/33148441 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2134/agronj14.0227 https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1431&context=biosysengfacpub https://core.ac.uk/download/33148441.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj14.0227,,10.2134/agronj14.0227,2015024019,,0,002-967-588-995-064; 003-232-594-172-08X; 012-133-504-974-402; 014-026-509-704-03X; 033-105-404-540-563; 033-890-182-096-159; 041-833-491-485-587; 050-379-187-721-820; 057-131-240-501-938; 063-690-150-316-403; 070-884-069-806-084; 074-088-259-080-980; 087-688-941-970-522; 096-970-668-761-353; 101-012-916-569-644; 108-743-392-147-523; 117-604-826-432-468; 127-785-284-544-120; 141-616-290-765-640; 180-524-585-737-168; 192-341-972-259-42X,19

Wratten; Michael H. Bowie; Janice M. Hickman; Alison M. Evans; J. Richard Sedcole; Jason M. Tylianakis,"Field boundaries play an important role as refuges, food sources and corridors for invertebrates and vertebrates, and increasing farmland fragmentation impacts on these functions. However, hedgerows and other structures can also impede dispersal by flying insects. The current work uses the pollen of Phacelia tanacetifolia in hover fly guts as a marker to assess hover fly movement in farm landscapes. In the United Kingdom and New Zealand, Phacelia pollen was found in the guts of Ephisyrphus balteatus and Metasyrphus corollae (United Kingdom) and Melanostoma fasciatum (New Zealand) at distances up to 200 m from the source, when there were no barriers between the flowers and the traps used to catch the flies. The rate of decline over distance in the proportion of flies containing pollen was similar for the two countries. The extent to which four replicated field boundary types impeded hover fly movement was tested using post-and-wire fences, lines of poplars (Populus spp.) with gaps, dense poplars and controls (no potential barriers). Phacelia was planted on one side of each boundary, and along the centre of the control plots. The relative presence of the pollen in flies on both sides of the barriers showed that both types of poplar boundary restricted the movement of the flies, but the fence had no effect. In a separate experiment, gravid females of M. fasciatum were captured at a greater height on a shade-cloth fence than were non-gravid females and males. The implications of this work include the functioning and persistence of metapopulations and the influence of field boundaries on population recovery of beneficial invertebrates following pesticide-induced mortality. If field boundaries contribute to a temporal asynchrony between pest and natural enemy populations, this needs to be considered along with the well-established roles of boundaries as refugia for, and sources of, beneficial arthropods.",134,4,605,611,Habitat; Ecology; Metapopulation; Phacelia tanacetifolia; Phacelia; Melanostoma fasciatum; Pollen; Population; Biological dispersal; Biology,,"Agriculture; Animals; Diptera; Female; Flight, Animal; Flowers; Magnoliopsida; Male; Movement; Pollen; Population Dynamics; Pregnancy; Reproduction",,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003Oecol.134..605W/abstract https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00442-002-1128-9 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12647134/ https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20033043034 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12647134 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-002-1128-9/fulltext.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-002-1128-9,12647134,10.1007/s00442-002-1128-9,2082940274,,0,000-999-762-967-231; 001-837-644-580-145; 006-314-244-124-537; 006-520-018-288-928; 008-608-775-518-291; 008-821-738-651-977; 009-646-332-019-745; 010-888-549-334-33X; 013-394-770-638-112; 013-539-528-365-106; 016-469-617-882-795; 019-658-253-028-863; 020-387-952-708-095; 023-835-862-117-81X; 026-735-761-517-671; 034-739-142-297-866; 037-801-316-449-334; 043-329-639-022-790; 044-341-011-136-23X; 047-130-476-878-70X; 056-892-630-404-500; 057-085-379-637-480; 057-597-475-456-662; 064-113-911-892-525; 066-807-757-722-083; 068-258-337-754-12X; 069-037-640-447-867; 071-263-947-951-344; 075-427-727-587-804; 076-540-943-950-859; 077-628-705-282-51X; 083-215-275-291-118; 086-402-015-642-906; 090-321-355-554-734; 090-682-458-827-532; 095-522-959-685-498; 099-929-944-949-999; 114-314-936-177-491; 132-980-742-169-431; 139-200-896-129-808; 140-931-811-862-053; 144-828-533-015-080; 188-441-039-602-933,146

Evans; L. Wes Burger; C. S. Oedekoven; Mark D. Smith; Samuel K. Riffell; James A. Martin; Stephen T. Buckland,"We coordinated a large-scale evaluation of northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) population response to establishment of 9-m to 37-m linear patches (buffers) of native herbaceous vegetation along row- crop field margins as part of the Conservation Reserve Program practice Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds (CP33). We compared northern bobwhite covey densities on 1,088 paired row-crop fields with and without native herbaceous buffers in 13 states during autumn, 2006-2008. We used a 2-stage random effects modeling approach that incorporates the effective area as an offset in generalized linear mixed models to assess regional relationships among autumn bobwhite covey densities and covariates of field type (i.e., fields with vs. without native herbaceous buffers), ecological region, year, survey week, and contracted vegetative cover (i.e., planting native grasses and forbs vs. establishing through natural regeneration). Covey density was correlated with year and interaction effects of field type and ecological region. The year effect suggested annual variation in covey densities, whereas the field type by ecological region interaction suggested covey response to buffers was dependent on spatial location, likely reflecting differences in buffer establishment, succession, and characteristics of the surrounding landscape among regions. Mean fitted covey density on fields across all survey sites was 0.047 (� 0.008 bootstrap standard error (BSE)) and 0.031 coveys/ha (� 0.003 BSE) on row-crop fields with and without herbaceous buffers, respectively. Covey density was greater on fields with buffers relative to matched, comparison fields without buffers in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (241%; P < 0.001) and both the eastern (123%; P < 0.001) and western (60%; P ¼ 0.01) portions of the Southeastern Coastal Plain region. Covey density was an order of magnitude greater in the central Texas region compared to other regions, but exhibited a small response to native herbaceous buffers, as did density of coveys in the Eastern Tallgrass Prairie and Central Hardwoods regions. Disproportionate response to buffers in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley and Southeastern Coastal Plain suggests native herbaceous habitats might be limiting during autumn in these regions, whereas lack of response in the Eastern Tallgrass Prairie, Central Hardwoods, and central Texas regions suggests that herbaceous habitat either was not limiting or buffers failed to provide adequate requirements for bobwhites during autumn. Selection of other habitats to meet security and thermoregulatory needs might have resulted in lack of response in these regions. Native herbaceous cover provided by buffers can provide critical habitat in row-crop agricultural systems in some regions, and can contribute to regional population recovery objectives of the Northern Bobwhite Conservation Initiative (NBCI). However, range-wide NBCI recovery objectives will best be met through multiple conservation practices in row-crop agricultural systems. 2013 The Wildlife Society.",77,4,716,725,Ecological succession; Forb; Conservation Reserve Program; Vegetation; Coastal plain; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Population; Herbaceous plant,,,,,https://www.cavs.msstate.edu/publications/docs/2013/02/12440Evansetal2013_CP33_coveys.pdf http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jwmg.502/abstract https://core.ac.uk/display/147220324 http://www.cavs.msstate.edu/publications/docs/2013/02/12440Evansetal2013_CP33_coveys.pdf https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jwmg.502 https://www.hpc.msstate.edu/publications/docs/2013/02/12440Evansetal2013_CP33_coveys.pdf https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jwmg.502/full https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jwmg.502,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.502,,10.1002/jwmg.502,2095964561,,0,000-281-554-875-962; 003-514-811-453-642; 005-106-242-640-56X; 007-345-255-242-473; 013-203-517-678-44X; 013-585-067-394-816; 019-561-810-281-087; 022-667-644-785-266; 034-308-643-508-970; 034-350-057-263-068; 034-456-136-124-424; 040-618-665-169-421; 044-378-055-160-070; 045-981-229-754-729; 046-353-350-401-617; 051-216-091-755-428; 056-041-050-320-014; 056-675-361-356-182; 060-606-378-139-892; 063-358-398-095-304; 068-567-084-277-634; 070-832-258-465-579; 072-745-845-642-67X; 078-312-557-460-956; 079-261-909-912-581; 086-208-994-884-984; 093-843-626-385-678; 094-906-771-985-436; 095-455-937-190-024; 096-572-548-038-300; 099-584-901-453-896; 106-173-595-941-095; 109-448-917-217-200; 119-334-550-015-609; 126-185-032-110-179; 133-199-519-838-349; 134-581-455-767-919; 149-200-651-727-319; 168-764-325-234-423; 179-048-991-295-983; 195-618-519-387-640,25
128-222-836-109-002,AVIAN NEST DENSITY AND SUCCESS IN GRASSED WATERWAYS IN IOWA ROWCROP FIELDS,,1994,,,,,,Georgia G. Bryan; Louis B. Best,"The U.S. Soil Conservation Service (USSCS) has promoted grassed waterways since 1947 to minimize soil erosion (Temple 1983). Grassed waterways are natural or constructed channels that have been shaped to transport water at nonerosive velocities from agricultural fields. When properly designed and maintained, grassed waterways do not have standing water. Geographic location and erosion potential determine the grass species planted in the channel, but generally, cool-season grasses are used because of their quick establishment and even, dense growth (USSCS 1975). Waterways also were promoted for their benefits to wildlife (USSCS 1972). High densities of nesting birds have been found in linear agricultural habitats such as fencerows, roadside ditches, and terraces (e.g., Dow 1969, Basore et al. 1986). This response also may occur in waterways. Because many fencerows have been removed (Vance 1976), grassed waterways may become more important wildlife habitat in agricultural areas. High nest density, however, is not necessarily synonymous with high reproductive output (Gates and Gysel 1978). Disturbance from farming practices can decrease nesting success below the level necessary to sustain populations (Rodenhouse and Best 1983, Frawley 1989). Development of management guidelines for grassed waterways is important, especially with the passage of the 1985 and 1990 farm bills. Both bills required landowners to implement a conservation plan if they were to continue farming annually tilled crops on highly erodible land. Conservation tillage, terracing, and grassed waterways could be used to meet this requirement (U.S. Dep. Agric. 1986). Our objectives were to (1) determine the species and nesting densities of birds in grassed waterways, (2) document nesting success in grassed waterways, and (3) assess the influence of waterway structure and vegetation on nest density and success.",,,,,Soil conservation; Erosion; Tillage; Vegetation; Nest; Habitat; Conservation Plan; Wildlife; Environmental science; Agroforestry; Forestry,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/3783083.pdf,https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/3783083.pdf,,,2517826417,,0,001-074-375-407-762; 003-969-255-277-49X; 006-160-602-569-108; 023-723-563-125-522; 025-928-926-460-066; 039-659-322-655-52X; 044-551-205-203-731; 047-000-620-546-182; 059-988-470-375-194; 073-679-047-201-179; 075-649-156-910-746; 076-773-289-720-027; 079-666-057-795-455; 085-060-541-856-759; 086-624-644-945-989; 093-843-626-385-678; 101-181-727-684-317; 107-818-341-854-639; 110-050-807-675-927; 124-876-829-420-596; 126-880-082-484-421; 131-056-779-330-399; 136-396-731-521-906; 141-820-975-724-030; 143-146-474-539-735; 149-594-572-892-345; 179-674-764-408-659,34

The species richness and abundance of heteropteran bugs in twenty 1- to 4-year-old wildflower areas and winter wheat fields were compared, and the effects of succession in the wildflower areas investigated. Vegetation and environmental parameters (plant species richness, vegetation structure, flower abundance, field size, surrounding landscape) and their effects on bug species were explored. Total species richness and abundance of bugs were significantly lower in wheat fields than in wildflower areas but did not differ in the wildflower areas of different ages. The numbers of zoophagous bugs in the wildflower areas were positively correlated with the age of the wildflower areas. Correspondence analysis showed that the bug species composition in the winter wheat fields was very similar but strongly separated from that in the wildflower areas. The species composition of bugs in the wildflower areas became increasingly dissimilar with advancing successional age. In a partial canonical correspondence analysis, the bug assemblage was significantly associated with the number of perennial plant species, the number of annual plant species and vegetation structure, which accounted for 13.4%, 12.6% and 7.2% of the variance, respectively. As wildflower areas clearly increased heteropteran diversity on arable land and bug species composition changed with increasing successional stage, the establishment of a mosaic of wildflower areas of different age is recommended as it enables the survival of heteropteran bugs with different life history traits.",103,1,61,70,Canonical correspondence analysis; Biodiversity; Ecological succession; Annual plant; Vegetation; Ecology; Wildflower; Species richness; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,http://www.eje.cz/artkey/eje-200601-0011_Effect_of_early_succession_in_wildflower_areas_on_bug_assemblages_Insecta_Heteroptera.php,http://dx.doi.org/10.14411/eje.2006.011,,10.14411/eje.2006.011,2105956409,,0,000-421-021-678-271; 001-043-709-656-485; 010-945-646-716-071; 011-493-172-373-290; 012-267-243-122-028; 015-293-390-356-199; 018-028-975-115-624; 019-774-373-196-018; 019-814-413-119-935; 022-475-958-188-636; 024-200-324-047-284; 027-601-881-483-122; 029-264-530-643-997; 029-324-991-196-140; 029-386-831-957-40X; 031-579-378-413-334; 035-294-680-593-133; 040-484-989-798-629; 041-768-237-199-317; 046-295-168-494-842; 049-088-413-362-630; 050-985-622-056-969; 053-832-610-795-117; 056-789-845-462-569; 056-917-605-782-890; 061-255-779-212-020; 063-112-903-921-487; 064-524-534-627-895; 064-528-210-517-110; 064-565-475-821-305; 067-648-083-799-017; 072-208-659-152-26X; 073-537-957-075-948; 074-657-096-997-491; 074-786-761-207-084; 075-182-328-430-399; 077-476-100-883-97X; 101-797-752-209-310; 102-495-977-538-353; 105-437-366-614-250; 106-466-422-683-648; 107-187-253-905-266; 112-242-610-920-545; 115-507-657-132-984; 117-345-687-903-78X; 118-304-349-828-794; 127-623-411-272-825; 127-760-625-158-658; 133-265-034-481-700; 138-845-934-876-76X; 141-831-429-401-588; 142-024-470-292-163; 151-431-337-222-216; 170-023-743-611-600; 183-317-106-800-666; 183-619-364-234-250; 188-841-690-986-57X; 193-338-755-951-750; 194-045-219-104-360; 198-940-857-887-87X,25
129-271-467-499-857,Nutrient Interception by a Riparian Forest Buffer Strip from Adjacent Orchard near Reservoir: Two Case Studies in Taiwan,,2008,,,,,,Zueng-Sang Chen; Chang-Fu Hsieh; Jen-Chyi Liu; Chung-Ming Lin,"Summary Two case studies, including Techi reservoir located at Taichung county, central Taiwan, and Feitsui reservoir located at Taipei county, northern Taiwan, were selected to study the effect of nutrient interception by a riparian forest buffer strip receiving the adjacent orchard region by applying the high and low quantity of chemical fertilizers, respectively. The widths of riparian forest buffer strip are at least 50 meters in these two case study sites. The composition, spatial variability and seasonal changes of cations and anions in soil solution collecting from orchard, interface and riparian buffer zones were analyzed to control the water quality in two water reservoirs. The results indicated that the soil nutrients in the orchard near Techi reservoir, especially for the ions of phosphate, K, Ca, Mg, and ammonium-N, can be significantly intercepted by a forest buffer strip within 30 meters. Owing to no any application of chemical fertilizers in the orchard near Feitsui reservoir since 1987, the nutrient concentration of different ions in soil solution is very low. This low concentration of ions in soil solution released from orchard region near Feitsui reservoir can be intercepted in the interface area between the orchard region and forest buffer strip. The results also indicate that the width of riparian buffer strip needs at least 10 meters to intercept the soluble nutrients under this very low input of chemical fertilizers. We make sure that enough width, at least 30 meters of riparian buffer strips for these two case studies, can be regarded as a nutrient sink to intercept the soil nutrients soluble from orchard region and keep good water quality in the reservoirs.",,,,,Nutrient; Sink (geography); Riparian forest; Riparian buffer; Orchard; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Interception,,,,,http://210.69.150.18:8080/bitstream/345210000/2855/1/publication_no134_10.pdf,http://210.69.150.18:8080/bitstream/345210000/2855/1/publication_no134_10.pdf,,,2261913268,,0,004-842-348-026-444; 013-186-225-354-847; 015-514-563-181-208; 021-187-528-186-865; 043-732-521-013-282; 045-051-399-949-632; 061-964-645-875-912; 069-743-203-039-775; 080-589-148-600-106; 083-258-693-486-102; 087-138-533-405-771; 096-940-340-038-375; 104-993-597-055-071; 107-136-033-727-592; 111-435-647-398-863; 137-894-043-621-258; 141-101-347-131-583; 150-539-908-471-485,0

Production and resource competition,,2005,journal article,Agroforestry Systems,01674366; 15729680,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Netherlands,W. A. J. M. De Costa; P. Surenthran,"Incorporation of tree hedges along contours has been proposed as a means of reducing soil erosion and increasing soil fertility of tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntz) plantations on sloping terrain in high-rainfall zones of Sri Lanka. Tea yields in these hedgerow intercrops are determined by the balance between the positive (i.e., increased soil fertility) and negative (i.e., resource competition) effects of hedgerows. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to determine: (a) the net effect of six different hedgerow species (Calliandra calothyrsus Meissner, Senna [Cassia] spectabilis (DC.) H. Irwin and Barneby, Euphatorium innulifolium (R.M. King and H. Rob.) H.B.K., Flemingia congesta Aiton F., Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) (Kunth.) Walp. and Tithonia diversifolia (Hemsl.) A. Gray) on long-term tea yields; (b) the effect of incorporating hedgerow prunings as mulch; and (c) the relationship between hedgerow characteristics (i.e., biomass production, canopy and root growth) and tea yield variation. Tea yields, measured over one complete pruning cycle from October 1998 to September 2001, showed reductions relative to a sole tea crop under all hedgerow species except Euphatorium. The yield reductions ranged from 22 to 40%. Tea yields under Euphatorium showed increases up to 23% relative to the sole crop control. Addition of hedgerow prunings as mulch increased tea yields in all hedgerow intercrops. The yield increases ranged from 11 to 20%, with the highest being under Euphatorium. Tea yields showed a negative relationship (R2=0.38) with the pruned biomass of hedgerows. Limitation of environmental resources (e.g., water and light) and hedgerow characters which intensified resource competition (i.e., greater canopy lateral spread and height and greater root length densities, especially in the top soil layer) were responsible for observed tea yield reductions in hedgerow intercrops.",63,3,199,209,Canopy; Mulch; Calliandra calothyrsus; Multipurpose tree; Gliricidia sepium; Intercropping; Camellia sinensis; Mathematics; Soil fertility; Agronomy,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-005-1090-8 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-005-1090-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-005-1090-8,,10.1007/s10457-005-1090-8,2011920188,,0,004-581-546-277-751; 006-391-745-204-227; 007-168-018-560-246; 019-521-193-829-310; 022-628-370-485-482; 027-521-117-984-941; 036-464-861-246-347; 037-532-115-759-51X; 042-207-042-604-454; 042-300-917-801-271; 045-247-838-307-047; 045-905-213-685-568; 058-903-477-264-727; 065-183-309-843-130; 065-457-576-857-719; 072-305-535-055-462; 088-913-514-752-007; 095-819-935-363-598; 125-396-589-332-143; 129-156-349-985-324; 148-996-118-437-401; 190-989-258-483-60X; 192-473-502-646-745; 193-027-699-364-261,26

Pywell; William R. Meek; R.G. Loxton; Marek Nowakowski; Claire Carvell; Ben A. Woodcock,"This study contrasted the effects of the most widely implemented, low cost restoration prescriptions promoted by the English AES with more demanding and costly options on plant and invertebrate community composition, and their functional traits. In all cases these prescriptions were compared to intensive crop management. The plant community regenerating from the seed bank was species-poor, highly dynamic and had a high proportion of undesirable crop weeds. Sowing a low-cost, simple mix of tall grasses resulted in a stable community dominated by competitive grasses. Creation of these habitats resulted in negligible shifts in the functional composition of the associated invertebrate community. Sowing a diverse mix of wildflowers resulted in a stable, perennial vegetation community with both legumes and regulating hemi-parasitic plants that supported significantly more pollinator and herbivore species, as well as higher abundances of beneficial arthropod predators. There were no measured synergies when a mix of tall grass and wildflower habitats were created adjacent to each other on the same margin. The results confirm the value of ecological restoration as a potentially useful means of enhancing ecosystem function within intensive farmland systems",140,1-2,62,67,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2010.11.012,,10.1016/j.agee.2010.11.012,,,0,002-948-324-537-293; 003-460-280-575-85X; 006-977-156-947-290; 008-225-619-668-580; 013-660-687-814-516; 016-421-756-148-512; 023-441-454-753-268; 026-459-668-136-913; 026-570-998-544-034; 030-453-266-652-445; 031-862-039-493-29X; 034-144-504-354-555; 034-333-107-858-752; 034-980-495-883-757; 036-192-238-397-024; 047-946-954-821-823; 050-907-802-597-89X; 063-663-054-349-80X; 067-912-727-549-225; 069-901-245-663-534; 071-192-821-815-608; 079-333-606-008-114; 088-084-600-968-335; 093-147-406-768-547; 093-814-735-661-608; 107-260-782-744-398; 117-345-687-903-78X; 125-995-631-935-63X; 132-775-784-488-585; 149-796-121-127-05X; 156-542-248-199-177,40

G. Lacas; Nadia Carluer; Marc Voltz,"Abstract Grass buffer strips limit the transfer of pesticides from cultivated fields to rivers. These solutions are generally efficient at reducing polluted surface flows, mainly by infiltration of the soil, raising the question of the fate of the infiltrated pollutants. An environmental evaluation was conducted on the efficiency of a grass strip receiving diuron-contaminated water from an uphill vineyard in France. During two runoff events, the following measurements were taken: surface inflow and outflow with Venturi flumes, vertical percolated flow below the root layer (0–50 cm), and variations in water and solute content of the root layer. One runoff event occurred under natural rainfall conditions, while the other runoff event was artificially provoked with water doped by diuron and bromide. For the natural runoff event, representative of medium intensity events, 94% of the diuron was retained in the root layer, whereas 2% left the grass strip by surface runoff and 4% left the grass strip in the water percolating under the root zone. For the artificial event, representative of intense runoff events, more than half of the incoming diuron was retained by the grass strip, whereas 24% and 18% of it were transferred by surface runoff and percolation, respectively. These results showed that the capacity of the root layer to retain diuron was highly significant despite a large percolation flux. However, for large runoff events, surface and subsurface losses can still be considerable, up to 40% of the pesticide load entering the strip.",22,4,580,592,Infiltration (hydrology); DNS root zone; Inflow; Vineyard; Hydrology; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Pollutant; Outflow,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1002016012600435 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1002016012600435,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1002-0160(12)60043-5,,10.1016/s1002-0160(12)60043-5,2035807414,,0,002-650-706-842-54X; 006-677-293-260-300; 007-985-273-091-256; 009-742-460-635-737; 010-729-699-684-898; 016-084-115-518-996; 016-986-501-772-549; 021-655-763-861-159; 024-953-196-350-874; 030-388-233-138-126; 042-230-387-909-769; 043-320-672-388-224; 044-401-317-828-273; 051-352-624-252-855; 051-851-638-777-86X; 052-894-240-545-387; 054-857-994-017-150; 055-777-345-712-483; 057-703-038-933-033; 062-646-485-663-090; 064-662-281-730-944; 065-427-966-967-115; 078-834-235-066-428; 082-425-030-497-387; 083-971-752-530-892; 086-496-072-727-834; 094-049-137-663-313; 144-806-415-704-267; 151-942-861-567-530; 178-140-173-536-98X; 181-090-792-931-175; 196-445-208-354-247,12

Andersson; Ola Olsson; Henrik G. Smith,"Pollinator populations have suffered severe declines in many industrialised countries due to reduced floral and nesting resources, brought on by agricultural intensification. One potential method of mitigating these effects is creating flower strips. Most previous studies have shown higher pollinator abundances in flower strips, but none have been able to demonstrate increased pollinator abundances at larger spatial scales, in the surrounding agricultural landscapes. We assessed local and landscape-wide effects of flower strips on pollinator abundances, using 18 carefully selected study landscapes in southern Sweden, distributed along independent gradients of landscape heterogeneity and farming intensity. We found that flower strips were more attractive than field borders in general to bumblebees, whereas hoverflies were only attracted to flower strips from nearby field borders. Solitary bees declined with increasing distance from flower strips, but only in complex landscapes. As one of the first studies investigating effects of flower strips on pollinators across the wider landscape, we found increased abundance of bumblebees, but not solitary bees, in field borders outside the flower strips in floristically enhanced landscapes as compared with control landscapes. However, we found that higher quality and/or larger total area of flower strips within a farm was important for both bumblebees and solitary bees. Hoverfly abundance was enhanced on farms with flower strips in simple landscapes. Our results demonstrate that flower strips with rewarding plants do not only attract pollinators locally, but in addition have the potential to increase pollinator abundances across entire landscapes, and particularly in landscapes dominated by farmland.",184,184,51,58,Pollinator; Distance decay; Ecology; Geography; Hoverfly; Agricultural landscapes; Agricultural intensification; Species richness; Abundance (ecology),,,,Marianne & Marcus Wallenberg Foundation; Swedish Research Council Formas; Biodiversity and Ecosystem services in a Changing Climate,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153296239 https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-d5e1c0a7-ca25-32a7-9aec-89b7fdca0977 https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lup/publication/e924415b-977d-49d4-b399-db0c7bad543c http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/en/publications/sown-flower-strips-in-southern-sweden-increase-abundances-of-wild-bees-and-hoverflies-in-the-wider-landscape(e924415b-977d-49d4-b399-db0c7bad543c)/export.html https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/e924415b-977d-49d4-b399-db0c7bad543c https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5361116 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320715000026 https://core.ac.uk/display/83687994,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2014.12.027,,10.1016/j.biocon.2014.12.027,2090903895,,0,001-327-205-642-420; 002-834-351-241-185; 004-703-632-577-796; 007-200-824-851-635; 007-429-738-896-728; 010-225-312-935-498; 011-658-232-414-967; 011-935-563-407-588; 012-357-805-545-268; 013-018-485-818-596; 013-144-739-926-739; 013-350-345-301-696; 015-412-660-027-58X; 015-433-009-233-539; 017-435-062-399-767; 018-442-796-237-224; 018-455-907-705-514; 019-261-764-977-002; 020-625-435-249-055; 022-392-117-877-556; 034-980-495-883-757; 035-691-308-793-277; 036-224-006-435-531; 037-733-558-467-103; 039-622-275-777-057; 040-411-161-740-008; 040-659-014-265-146; 047-993-395-949-418; 049-136-936-899-799; 049-567-584-028-555; 056-585-869-238-25X; 057-420-111-160-322; 062-554-425-020-511; 066-269-723-697-371; 070-573-740-499-634; 076-307-235-228-944; 085-507-496-811-84X; 085-687-962-600-03X; 098-312-271-690-700; 107-002-181-939-884; 113-225-847-396-026; 113-464-996-560-182; 115-606-139-771-296; 124-319-214-482-940; 124-919-254-161-446; 137-849-519-365-833; 145-523-815-049-35X; 150-325-162-873-23X; 161-589-110-148-114; 163-801-893-269-809; 165-420-840-117-725; 168-312-770-361-773; 172-555-092-221-552,67

Montgomery,"Agricultural intensification in Northern Ireland has brought about large-scale changes to the landscape with a detrimental effect on biodiversity. Between 1996 and 1998, we surveyed a stratified random sample of 1 km squares for bats using a spot-sample technique and time expansion bat detector to establish linear and area habitat associations. Bats strongly selected water bodies with bankside vegetation, treelines, and deciduous and mixed woodland edge, avoiding open areas such as upland/unimproved grassland and improved grassland. Of three sympatric pipistrelle species (Pipistrellus pipistrellus, P. pygmaeus and P. nathusii), two were shown to forage in different habitats; P. pipistrellus being more of a ‘generalist’, foraging in a wider variety of habitats than P. pygmaeus, a ‘specialist’ which foraged in a smaller range of habitats. Nyctalus leisleri selected parkland/amenity grassland, deciduous woodland edge and rivers/canals and avoided improved grassland, hedgerows, whilst Myotis spp. selected deciduous woodland centre, lake/reservoir margins and rivers/canals. Reduction in area and quality of inland water, deciduous woodlands and field boundaries in Northern Ireland may impact on bat populations. Habitat management should focus on improving those habitats which are selected by bats, including the maintenance and enhancement of connecting linear habitats. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Poole; David C. Bradley; Rosie Diane Salazar; David W. Macdonald,"Abstract Freshwater ecosystems deliver services that are crucial to human existence and well-being, yet, globally, their degradation has outpaced remedial management. Rivers can be subjected to a range of anthropogenic pressures and agricultural land use is one major cause of water pollution and habitat degradation in European rivers. The Water Framework Directive is a major legislative driver for good ecological status in Europe's rivers and in the UK; this has led to attempts to reduce the negative effects of agriculture on rivers through agri-environment schemes (AES). AES are funded from tax revenue and it is important that they are optimized to deliver measurable ecological improvements. The purpose of this paper is to assess the ecological effectiveness of AES in a lowland English river basin. We examined the effect of distance from river in optimizing AES for the biological heath and conservation value of rivers. We used aquatic macroinvertebrates as indicators of river health and conservation value, to assess the effects of AES likely to improve river health (hereafter “AES river options”). This catchment in lowland England had a very high (over 80%) level of uptake of entry level AES, and facilitated a comparison between schemes that do or do not contain AES river options. The conservation value of macroinvertebrate communities and the proportion of macroinvertebrates intolerant of water pollution and sedimentation increased with high proportions of woodland within 100 m or 500 m of the river throughout the entire upstream catchment. High proportions of AES river options within the same distance were correlated with higher proportions of sediment-sensitive macroinvertebrates.

Bell; Paul J. Johnson; Clive Hambler; Alison J. Haughton; Helen Lawton Smith; Ruth E. Feber; Fran H. Tattersall; Barbara H Hart; Will Manley; David W. Macdonald,"Populations of the linyphiid spider Lepthyphantes tenuis were sampled in field margins in May, July and September in 1990–1991 and 1995–1996. Field margins were subjected to 10 grassland management regimes, which included the effects of spraying the herbicide glyphosate, cutting, leaving vegetation in situ after the cut, sowing and a control. These treatments were randomised within six complete blocks at the University of Oxford’s farm at Wytham. Cutting vegetation had an immediate effect on number of L. tenuis in both spring and summer. Cutting margins in summer had a more persistent effect on populations of L. tenuis than did cutting margins in spring. The effect of cutting was not mitigated by leaving cut vegetation in situ, but no cutting ensured higher number of L. tenuis in margins, an indication that height and structural complexity of grassland vegetation were important in determining population size. Significantly fewer spiders were found in July and September plots which had been sprayed with herbicide in late June/early July. However, spider numbers were not affected by glyphosate application when samples were taken nearly a year later. Sowing a wildflower seed mixture had no significant effects on number of this generalist predator although other invertebrate groups did benefit. Field margins provided an excellent source habitat for L. tenuis. Habitats that border crop fields acted as a refugia for many other beneficial invertebrates and should be retained as an important component of the agricultural landscape.",93,1,295,304,Crop; Sowing; Vegetation; Habitat; Ecology; Grassland; Wildflower; Linyphiidae; Agroecosystem; Biology,,,,,https://www.nds.ox.ac.uk/publications/156677 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880901003437 https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:e0c1bf6a-9fbf-4947-a61c-618198a21aff,https://www.nds.ox.ac.uk/publications/156677,,,2068156723,,0,003-577-472-065-802; 007-827-850-871-938; 008-749-571-472-067; 021-985-199-664-948; 034-993-566-323-363; 035-512-326-342-385; 037-325-128-567-400; 040-477-193-803-773; 041-221-364-304-707; 051-221-621-734-736; 053-830-117-088-153; 057-612-922-967-628; 061-255-779-212-020; 065-874-439-716-802; 069-379-822-515-162; 069-405-099-165-947; 070-360-118-413-221; 074-811-254-859-725; 076-780-961-274-420; 081-565-912-450-722; 084-387-070-806-39X; 087-186-786-234-321; 091-563-882-813-329; 092-151-348-850-74X; 101-797-752-209-310; 114-480-653-531-829; 118-409-347-010-789; 122-593-714-312-795; 123-544-334-375-765; 137-637-923-794-571; 145-117-801-250-235; 147-924-760-530-890; 149-178-855-517-470; 163-029-689-861-775; 181-152-858-345-461; 191-484-582-462-838; 195-100-863-120-148,22

Schmitz; Iván A. Sánchez; I. de Aranzabal,"Hedgerows are an important component of the cultural landscape and may have an invaluable role in maintaining biological diversity. Adjacent land use potentially has an important influence on the species composition of hedgerows. In the Mediterranean region, hedgerows are considered as remnants of past practices and their function may be linked with the prevailing agrarian systems, in turn related to societal change. In this paper, the characteristics of hedgerows in Central Spain, and their interactions with adjacent fields were studied in order to understand their contribution to maintaining woody plant species richness in the cultural landscape. The hedgerow typology of the region were found to respond jointly both to environmental and livestock farming-related variations in adjacent land uses. The variation in the management intensity of the landscape is reflected in the composition of the woody plant species of hedgerows, varying from species of open landscape to woodland species. Moderate degrees of grazing allow for higher values of woody plant richness in hedgerows compared with those hedgerows separating systems subjected to a higher livestock loads or to abandonment processes. Thus, hedgerows potentially contribute to the functionality of these cultural landscapes and provide a basis of important ecological and historical value in landscape conservation planning. These conclusions have important implications in the development of landscape conservation and protection policies.",135,4,542,554,Cultural landscape; Woody plant; Biodiversity; Ecology; Woodland; Geography; Grazing; Grazing pressure; Land use; Species richness; Agroforestry,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320706004861,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2006.10.053,,10.1016/j.biocon.2006.10.053,2036222281,,0,004-188-012-557-897; 007-861-141-712-992; 010-250-877-529-926; 012-335-108-074-344; 013-469-671-476-318; 014-561-447-833-403; 014-993-031-099-021; 016-915-486-723-598; 023-950-701-194-236; 024-608-779-166-000; 026-347-133-531-945; 029-098-856-886-787; 030-360-926-125-323; 032-404-572-767-963; 035-533-140-870-529; 037-329-482-386-002; 041-161-807-605-997; 045-228-024-927-593; 047-949-455-932-004; 051-197-969-663-775; 052-953-850-403-789; 053-643-073-503-138; 055-107-013-670-19X; 055-967-815-565-228; 057-843-857-196-908; 061-507-800-670-287; 061-659-654-152-299; 064-382-557-768-876; 067-277-473-537-389; 068-111-201-124-755; 068-737-503-701-196; 069-901-245-663-534; 073-798-803-161-275; 074-377-822-985-393; 074-795-870-121-719; 078-159-103-272-848; 084-101-049-675-878; 086-203-830-508-920; 089-585-128-318-217; 089-852-052-919-49X; 092-165-704-813-521; 092-630-450-839-078; 103-000-158-530-47X; 104-785-918-564-998; 108-370-770-776-601; 110-668-176-117-818; 117-776-605-970-036; 130-698-554-759-854; 134-157-551-666-007; 144-142-747-565-209; 144-650-014-019-56X; 148-355-663-730-312; 149-553-299-982-540; 149-673-684-724-149; 150-494-637-604-381; 155-895-509-641-97X; 159-968-826-294-430; 164-209-429-488-825; 176-506-367-701-104; 187-050-769-304-212,38

However, assessments of their impact on field-scale spatial variability in crop performance are rare. A case of practices affecting spatial crop response at field level in a systematic way is the contour hedgerow system, a widespread soil conservation technique on steep lands in the tropics. The objectives of this study were to assess: (i) spatial variability in crop response under contour hedgerow systems in the Andes and (ii) implications for management of steep land alley farming. In order to measure spatial variability in crop response, Triticum aestivum was sown in rows following the contours, placed every 25 cm along the slope direction. Grain yield was monitored on eight alleys, having slopes from 15 to 30%, a length of 4–8 m and soils ranging from Dystri-Vertic Cambisols to Haplic Phaeozem, in the Andes region of Ecuador. In order to relate crop response with soil fertility, soil sampling was carried out in bands following the contour. Top soil properties, such as organic carbon, N Total , NO 3 − , P, exchangeable Aluminium, P fixation, exchangeable bases, CEC and texture, were analysed. The barrier strips of the contour hedgerow systems were composed of: (i) Pennisetum clandestinum and Lolium multiflorum or (ii) Phalaris tuberosa . Spatial variability in crop response was described by fourth-order polynomial equations, where position in the alley was the independent variable and plant characteristics were the dependent variables. Grain yield ranged from 0.8 to 4.0 t ha −1 (net area). Clear and significant patterns of spatial variability in crop response were found in all alleys, with R 2 varying from 0.55 to 0.90. Crop response was strongly and positively correlated with NO 3 − , P, exchangeable bases or organic carbon, dependent on the management, age and soil conditions of the alleys. Tillage erosion and soil accumulation on respectively the upper and lower elevations of the alleys were the main causes for a tendency to a significantly increased crop response along the slope direction. However, according the type of grass used in the barrier strip, competition for soil fertility and soil moisture occurred and influenced in negative way crop productivity in the lower elevations of the alleys. An index is proposed to assess the effect of contour hedgerows on crop response. The present study shows that contour hedgerow systems cannot always be evaluated as completely positive. Soil fertility improvement on the upper part of the alleys and a better management of the barrier strip are suggested to enhance crop productivity of contour hedgerow systems.",86,1,15,26,Soil conservation; Erosion; Soil science; Soil water; Tillage; Topsoil; Phaeozem; Soil fertility; Environmental science; Agronomy; Spatial variability,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167198705000516 http://dspace.ucuenca.edu.ec/bitstream/123456789/22080/1/scopus%20176.pdf http://core.ac.uk/display/34294855 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/2864918 http://dspace.ucuenca.edu.ec/handle/123456789/22080,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2005.01.017,,10.1016/j.still.2005.01.017,2020842979,,0,029-657-450-478-01X; 042-636-165-389-067; 043-891-092-451-521; 055-842-500-678-050; 056-469-665-362-162; 059-003-128-993-115; 067-141-650-949-112; 069-331-170-591-756; 070-008-702-916-976; 075-980-342-562-87X; 080-321-243-422-726; 083-863-992-943-057; 095-023-750-794-099; 103-893-186-269-601; 117-140-699-057-358; 120-287-757-796-357; 125-082-642-394-270; 167-915-069-389-889; 187-118-162-708-884; 189-664-585-315-530; 192-341-972-259-42X,55

Especially the role of P sorption by soil in buffer zones needs closer examination as there is considerable variation in the efficiency of P retention. Six sites in southern Finland were chosen for the study. The buffer zone areas varied between 0.1–4.9% of the catchment area. A total of 10 kg of solute PO4–P was added to the inflow of the buffer zone areas and the concentrations of PO4–P in inflow and outflow were measured for 2–4 years. P retention characteristics of the surface peat were determined with sorption-desorption isotherms before and after PO4–P addition and the effective buffer zone area over which the added P was spread was determined from soil water samples. P retention in the two largest buffer zone areas was complete (100% retention), and the third largest buffer retained 94%. Retention in the three smallest buffer zones was 24%, 95% and 95% of the added P. As a result of P addition reduction in peat P retention capacity was detected in three out of four cases. The effective buffer zone area varied from 67% to 100% of the total buffer zone area. Factors contributing to efficient P retention were large buffer size and low hydrological load whereas high hydrological load combined with the formation of preferential flow paths, especially during early spring or late autumn was disadvantageous. High P retention capacity in peat contributed to the sustainability of P retention. The study showed that even relatively small buffer zone areas are able to efficiently reduce P load.",42,2,211,231,Buffer (optical fiber); Soil water; Buffer zone; Sediment; Nutrient leaching; Hydrology; Environmental science; Phosphorus; Peat; Sorption,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eeva-Stiina_Tuittila/publication/228759695_Retention_of_phosphorus_in_peatland_buffer_zones_at_six_forested_catchments_in_southern_Finland/links/09e4150976f960e22a000000.pdf?inViewer=true&disableCoverPage=true&origin=publication_detail https://core.ac.uk/display/52283732 https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/publications/retention-of-phosphorus-in-peatland-buffer-zones-at-six-forested- https://www.silvafennica.fi/article/253,http://dx.doi.org/10.14214/sf.253,,10.14214/sf.253,2054996127,,0,001-125-622-943-026; 001-561-852-418-260; 009-883-180-635-192; 010-614-202-580-365; 024-574-311-980-469; 027-528-579-415-817; 035-592-842-052-82X; 037-971-645-823-472; 047-021-862-035-177; 047-867-215-300-877; 048-733-468-312-668; 051-040-469-307-031; 056-333-317-172-802; 065-670-961-197-406; 070-129-859-863-682; 074-192-201-829-063; 074-899-458-301-212; 080-446-549-224-561; 084-412-111-144-76X; 086-014-193-901-136; 088-236-621-248-724; 091-379-432-238-806; 105-034-245-999-59X; 120-870-261-401-233; 125-888-930-189-75X; 149-286-358-366-075; 153-882-585-520-437; 154-857-629-842-457; 158-912-254-329-597; 164-516-378-178-172; 175-051-714-868-941; 178-214-763-171-65X; 192-767-162-365-122,35

The total abundance of each group was highest in uncropped strips, but also higher in Conservation Headlands than in fully sprayed headlands. Species diversity for spiders and Heteroptera was significantly higher in uncropped strips and Conservation Headlands than in fully sprayed headlands. Species richness for both these groups and carabids was higher in all fields in uncropped headlands and Conservation Headlands than in the fully sprayed controls. The community structure of carabids and spiders was altered by headland management; it also changed with the age of the uncropped strips.

Potts; Ben A. Woodcock; Paul Eggleton,"1. The establishment of grassy strips at the margins of arable fields is an agri-environment scheme that aims to provide resources for native flora and fauna and thus increase farmland biodiversity. These margins can be managed to target certain groups, such as farmland birds and pollinators, but the impact of such management on the soil fauna has been poorly studied. This study assessed the effect of seed mix and management on the biodiversity, conservation and functional value of field margins for soil macrofauna. 2. Experimental margin plots were established in 2001 in a winter wheat field in Cambridgeshire, UK, using a factorial design of three seed mixes and three management practices [spring cut, herbicide application and soil disturbance (scarification)]. In spring and autumn 2005, soil cores taken from the margin plots and the crop were hand-sorted for soil macrofauna. The Lumbricidae, Isopoda, Chilopoda, Diplopoda, Carabidae and Staphylinidae were identified to species and classified according to feeding type. 3. Diversity in the field margins was generally higher than in the crop, with the Lumbricidae, Isopoda and Coleoptera having significantly more species and/or higher abundances in the margins. Within the margins, management had a significant effect on the soil macrofauna, with scarified plots containing lower abundances and fewer species of Isopods. The species composition of the scarified plots was similar to that of the crop. 4. Scarification also reduced soil- and litter-feeder abundances and predator species densities, although populations appeared to recover by the autumn, probably as a result of dispersal from neighbouring plots and boundary features. The implications of the responses of these feeding groups for ecosystem services are discussed. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that the management of agri-environment schemes can significantly influence their value for soil macrofauna. In order to encourage the litter-dwelling invertebrates that tend to be missing from arable systems, agri-environment schemes should aim to minimize soil cultivation and develop a substantial surface litter layer. However, this may conflict with other aims of these schemes, such as enhancing floristic and pollinator diversity.",45,1,269,278,Fauna; Biodiversity; Soil water; Ecology; Litter; Lumbricidae; Biological dispersal; Soil biology; Arable land; Biology,,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01433.x/full https://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND44005259 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01433.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01433.x https://www.jstor.org/stable/20143973 http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/9185/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01433.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01433.x,1563004395,,0,001-575-548-525-27X; 012-183-047-887-156; 013-470-213-401-798; 016-232-750-481-776; 017-786-901-727-296; 020-564-612-156-583; 022-526-631-372-455; 026-162-389-848-750; 030-453-266-652-445; 031-579-378-413-334; 035-350-419-524-672; 040-170-064-833-822; 042-303-914-852-499; 043-879-605-645-910; 045-327-551-062-265; 048-888-393-075-616; 050-364-885-261-831; 051-528-883-280-881; 056-099-523-856-735; 056-585-869-238-25X; 056-789-845-462-569; 058-105-561-757-413; 063-617-276-329-073; 064-255-371-732-136; 066-561-161-953-166; 074-793-529-288-006; 077-911-524-409-482; 080-139-567-968-521; 086-797-670-278-652; 089-224-342-698-288; 091-138-428-230-61X; 094-442-752-754-939; 098-719-657-126-04X; 106-051-677-401-185; 110-673-327-117-273; 116-073-484-834-128; 117-037-973-424-857; 117-345-687-903-78X; 118-807-690-083-030; 119-089-019-715-348; 121-691-035-270-645; 121-732-999-502-12X; 122-528-143-728-138; 123-841-301-855-392; 125-305-681-059-534; 125-786-651-769-041; 127-029-369-930-692; 128-760-888-268-265; 134-783-595-645-599; 136-816-007-966-101; 137-193-830-786-041; 142-547-556-180-595; 145-653-851-729-665; 153-093-532-626-009; 160-898-580-838-366; 167-613-411-928-937; 183-044-272-459-669; 190-678-631-976-253,94

135-879-091-021-910,Physical properties of a boreal clay soil under differently managed perennial vegetation,2011-11-25,2011,dissertation,,,,,Kimmo Rasa,"The physical properties of surface soil horizons, essentially pore size, shape, continuity and affinity for water, regulate water entry into the soil. These properties are prone to changes caused by natural forces and human activity. The hydraulic properties of the surface soil greatly impact the generation of surface runoff and accompanied erosion, the major concern of agricultural water protection.; ; The general target of this thesis was to improve our understanding of the structural and hydraulic properties of boreal clay soils. Physical properties of a clayey surface soil (0–10 cm, clay content 51%), with a micaceous/illitic mineralogy subjected to three different management practices of perennial vegetation, were studied. Tee study sites were vegetated buffer zones located side by side in SW Finland: 1) natural vegetation with no management, 2) harvested once a year, and 3) grazed by cattle. The soil structure, hydraulic properties, shrinkage properties and soil water repellency were determined at all sites.; ; Two distinct flow domains were evident. The surface soil was characterized by subangular blocky, angular blocky and platy aggregates. Hence, large, partially accommodated, irregular elongated pores dominated the macropore domain at all sites. The intra-aggregate pore system was mostly comprised of pores smaller than 30 µm, which are responsible for water storage. Macropores at the grazed site, compacted by hoof pressure, were horizontally oriented and pore connectivity was poorest, which decreased water and air flux compared with other sites.; ; Drying of the soil greatly altered its structure. The decrease in soil volume between wet and dry soil was 7–10%, most of which occurred in the moisture range of field conditions. Structural changes, including irreversible collapse of interaggregate pores, began at matric potentials around -6 kPa indicating, instability of soil structure against increasing hydraulic stress. Water saturation and several freezethaw cycles between autumn and spring likely weakened the soil structure.; ; Soil water repellency was observed at all sites at the time of sampling and when soil was dryer than about 40 vol.%. (matric potential < -6 kPa).Therefore, water repellency contributes to water ?ow over a wide moisture range. Water repellency was also observed in soils with low organic carbon content (< 2%), which suggests that this phenomenon is common in agricultural soils of Finland due to their relatively high organic carbon content.; ; Aggregate-related pedofeatures of dense infillings described as clay intrusions were found at all sites. The formation of these intrusions was attributed to clay dispersion and/or translocation during spring thaw and drying of the suspension in situ. These processes generate very new aggregates whose physical properties are most probably different from those of the bulk soil aggregates. Formation of the clay infillings suggested that prolonged wetness in autumn and spring impairs soil structure due to clay dispersion, while on the other hand it contributes to the pedogenesis of the soil.; ; The results emphasize the dynamic nature of the physical properties of clay soils, essentially driven by their moisture state. In a dry soil, fast preferential flow is favoured by abundant macropores including shrinkage cracks and is further enhanced by water repellency. Increase in soil moisture reduces water repellency, and swelling of accommodated pores lowers the saturated hydraulic conductivity. Moisture- and temperature-related processes significantly alter soil structure over a time span of 1 yr. Thus, the pore characteristics as well as the hydraulic properties of soil are time-dependent.",,,,,Soil structure; Geology; Soil horizon; Soil science; Soil water; Water content; Field capacity; Hydrology; Soil morphology; Macropore; Soil compaction,,,,,https://jukuri.luke.fi/handle/10024/438307 https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/27999 https://jukuri.luke.fi/bitstream/10024/438307/1/mtttiede17.pdf http://orgprints.org/19915/,https://jukuri.luke.fi/handle/10024/438307,,,1608245688,,0,000-714-376-181-669; 001-605-419-214-306; 001-763-748-932-185; 002-218-540-430-074; 003-216-656-311-031; 003-728-899-949-75X; 005-357-386-682-589; 006-112-467-649-909; 006-992-687-652-243; 009-806-097-947-292; 010-499-008-581-398; 011-810-592-342-745; 012-418-024-310-761; 016-848-523-806-740; 017-111-167-858-383; 017-207-614-781-506; 018-178-708-006-486; 019-098-138-396-449; 019-270-514-853-538; 020-101-432-680-424; 020-345-278-478-455; 022-427-726-413-164; 022-749-273-075-167; 024-697-680-251-464; 024-854-491-170-055; 025-785-361-584-639; 026-487-241-368-588; 027-482-659-615-324; 028-113-186-445-988; 031-534-591-514-565; 032-664-418-096-218; 032-893-648-758-730; 033-140-675-780-351; 034-095-942-799-599; 035-193-772-928-540; 036-451-003-276-467; 038-523-146-946-643; 038-685-402-758-927; 038-868-380-840-939; 040-640-129-139-174; 041-487-827-448-079; 042-560-004-541-20X; 043-732-976-612-222; 044-976-305-667-49X; 045-016-868-343-307; 045-634-219-090-336; 048-483-820-392-371; 048-858-992-586-998; 050-192-580-951-948; 050-812-999-384-940; 051-710-862-228-735; 053-560-836-717-094; 054-348-711-099-85X; 054-908-761-572-812; 055-968-340-676-972; 056-708-960-177-539; 056-891-438-725-430; 062-400-799-938-560; 062-801-697-507-150; 064-856-446-927-469; 065-369-416-141-981; 067-752-046-705-122; 068-802-919-590-707; 070-129-859-863-682; 070-686-985-257-87X; 070-820-334-352-472; 073-409-539-406-517; 074-156-419-052-56X; 078-826-203-482-769; 079-838-876-690-129; 080-581-329-922-191; 082-990-413-926-312; 083-804-983-487-125; 084-395-202-675-281; 085-621-179-457-583; 085-909-140-788-564; 086-005-412-432-452; 086-115-282-706-984; 090-559-945-326-053; 091-904-592-164-01X; 092-151-860-414-648; 093-033-934-189-455; 093-484-116-981-515; 093-759-431-803-532; 094-148-540-785-699; 095-619-675-811-019; 099-584-998-034-531; 100-234-600-333-894; 102-085-103-343-879; 103-405-209-202-261; 107-405-192-118-164; 108-141-000-381-065; 111-584-131-127-56X; 111-755-322-045-608; 111-851-604-417-545; 112-062-796-589-388; 112-269-099-044-532; 115-702-098-134-986; 115-828-139-106-29X; 120-918-953-399-402; 122-627-855-623-733; 128-086-359-199-469; 129-480-345-389-650; 130-557-815-198-305; 132-584-564-131-339; 134-467-497-031-708; 134-709-096-805-847; 135-022-117-721-964; 137-422-756-980-765; 137-978-528-420-196; 138-900-697-590-248; 141-828-395-465-227; 147-098-747-785-184; 148-842-839-659-846; 152-966-425-884-356; 153-999-030-321-070; 155-077-672-111-552; 158-040-572-868-750; 159-929-671-813-635; 167-016-663-145-300; 169-740-494-734-509; 170-394-743-358-599; 178-520-538-458-588; 186-317-894-454-23X; 194-715-434-436-552,1
135-883-559-011-411,Factors driving small rodents assemblages from field boundaries in agricultural landscapes of Western France.,,2006,journal article,Landscape Ecology,09212973; 15729761,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,United States,Butet Alain; Paillat Gilles; Delettre Yannick,"In this study, we investigated the factors driving diversity and abundance of small rodent species inhabiting permanent linear habitat patches within high-intensified agricultural landscapes of western France. Multivariate (co-inertia) analysis was used to analyse relationships of habitat and landscape descriptive variables with rodent records. Two main ecological gradients were recognized according to statistical analysis. Relationships of species occurrence with environmental factors were interpreted according to their main life traits. The first ecological gradient clearly differentiated communities from hedges to those of grass-dominated linear banks. This first gradient was associated with the prevalence of forest versus grassland rodent species. This partitioning seems to reflect rather ecological requirements of species than competitive interactions. Small rodents diversity and abundance were inversely evolving along this gradient. The second factor influencing species assemblages was associated to landscape heterogeneity surrounding the permanent habitats. According to this second gradient, species seemed to be selected in relation to their ability to disperse and to use cultivated fields. Maximum diversity was generally observed in heterogeneous permanent habitats with mixed vegetation structure but hedges are important to produce biomass for predators.",21,3,449,461,Biomass (ecology); Vegetation; Habitat; Predation; Ecology; Geography; Grassland; Species richness; Abundance (ecology); Landscape ecology,,,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00079749 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=1980705 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-005-4118-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-005-4118-6,,10.1007/s10980-005-4118-6,2013964643,,0,001-904-308-482-463; 003-625-048-428-073; 007-871-326-224-951; 008-071-380-824-828; 008-777-165-646-699; 012-318-124-325-671; 012-797-821-085-07X; 015-796-697-992-282; 018-328-570-183-455; 020-730-936-477-632; 022-305-359-356-835; 024-762-640-747-076; 026-476-550-721-011; 027-660-266-450-644; 027-896-928-540-886; 032-855-446-092-54X; 035-946-961-356-303; 037-650-977-157-86X; 039-141-329-184-170; 039-160-868-641-848; 041-705-173-841-535; 049-626-027-186-179; 050-421-626-148-672; 051-317-477-817-006; 051-757-683-382-604; 053-687-442-913-71X; 055-107-013-670-19X; 056-035-766-067-180; 060-009-962-481-27X; 061-967-232-577-128; 061-996-531-259-624; 063-104-996-167-072; 063-736-836-313-347; 067-972-680-111-246; 068-488-271-134-879; 073-315-705-967-655; 074-068-982-114-504; 074-793-529-288-006; 075-781-408-578-136; 084-744-111-694-770; 090-530-590-260-577; 095-339-337-301-140; 095-771-327-475-203; 096-010-724-323-262; 099-491-868-961-481; 102-782-555-017-103; 103-213-922-658-428; 111-685-276-532-817; 112-931-313-768-747; 116-368-033-708-622; 116-575-040-978-913; 116-719-085-121-112; 119-612-887-575-561; 124-326-420-983-688; 124-671-257-104-598; 126-903-252-358-903; 128-317-688-498-414; 135-635-788-728-958; 138-933-911-367-276; 147-490-702-686-71X; 149-637-084-258-22X; 155-789-544-191-768; 162-612-397-149-323; 164-187-601-168-344; 164-502-760-111-254; 165-351-635-867-096; 184-941-372-178-860; 190-362-297-665-693,53

Griffiths; R. J. Parkinson,"We examined whether nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) export was enhanced from grassland receiving inorganic fertilizer and manures typical of intensive livestock production. Buffer strips were included in the study to determine if they could reduce nutrient export. Hillslope plots receiving granular inorganic fertilizer, liquid cattle slurry and solid cattle manure (FYM) were compared using rainfall simulation for 4 storms on consecutive days at 22 mm h-1 and 35 minutes duration. The plots were hydrologically isolated in a randomized block layout of 4 treatments × 3 replicates and measured 30 × 5m; the upper 20m received either fertilizer, slurry or FYM, while the lower 10 m acted as an unfertilized grass buffer strip. Nitrogen and P export in surface runoff from grassland receiving inorganic fertilizer exceeded that from FYM or slurry treatments; concentrations up to46mgN1--1 and 15 mgP1–1 were recorded. Sixty eight % and 62% of the N from FYM and slurry respectively, was exported in organic form. Seventy four % (FYM) and 39% (slurry) of the P was in particulate or dissolved organic form. The buffer strip reduced N export in surface runoff by 94% and P export by 98% from inorganic fertilizer plots. A 75% reduction in N export was recorded from the buffer zone below slurry plots but only a 10% reduction in P, with most P remaining in the particulate or dissolved organic fraction. There was no significant difference in N export from the buffer zone between the inorganic fertilizer treatment and the untreated control.",14,3,142,148,Nutrient; Randomized block design; Chemistry; Organic fertilizer; Fertilizer; Manure; Buffer strip; Phosphorus; Agronomy; Slurry,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-2743.1998.tb00140.x https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/49767/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-2743.1998.tb00140.x,,10.1111/j.1475-2743.1998.tb00140.x,2055183171,,0,001-552-336-296-127; 002-142-533-428-402; 002-176-190-436-229; 006-718-231-188-065; 022-221-235-051-417; 023-375-186-114-060; 024-542-768-678-79X; 028-361-393-856-416; 033-816-566-480-998; 042-299-110-754-392; 063-155-696-102-795; 071-462-069-230-683; 077-774-106-623-859; 102-307-069-255-349; 104-230-077-662-702; 105-288-983-298-744; 148-021-978-074-372; 149-334-106-582-234; 153-400-209-057-384; 163-524-671-421-139; 168-624-174-812-657; 170-806-540-782-080; 180-995-412-441-853; 183-143-735-590-924; 195-182-016-878-718,86

Perry; Peter Rothery; R. J. Scott; David Brooks; G. T. Champion; Cathy Hawes; Matthew S. Heard; Les G. Firbank,"The effects of management of genetically modified herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops on adjacent field margins were assessed for 59 maize, 66 beet and 67 spring oilseed rape sites. Fields were split into halves, one being sown with a GMHT crop and the other with the equivalent conventional non-GMHT crop. Margin vegetation was recorded in three components of the field margins. Most differences were in the tilled area, with fewer smaller effects mirroring them in the verge and boundary. In spring oilseed rape fields, the cover, flowering and seeding of plants were 25%, 44% and 39% lower, respectively, in the GMHT uncropped tilled margins. Similarly, for beet, flowering and seeding were 34% and 39% lower, respectively, in the GMHT margins. For maize, the effect was reversed, with plant cover and flowering 28% and 67% greater, respectively, in the GMHT half. Effects on butterflies mirrored these vegetation effects, with 24% fewer butterflies in margins of GMHT spring oilseed rape. The likely cause is the lower nectar supply in GMHT tilled margins and crop edges. Few large treatment differences were found for bees, gastropods or other invertebrates. Scorching of vegetation by herbicide-spray drift was on average 1.6% on verges beside conventional crops and 3.7% beside GMHT crops, the difference being significant for all three crops.",358,1439,1879,1898,Agriculture; Biodiversity; Invertebrate; Crop; Nectar; Vegetation; Plant cover; Agronomy; Arable land; Biology,,"Agriculture/methods; Animals; Beta vulgaris/physiology; Biodiversity; Brassica napus/physiology; Environment; Herbicides/metabolism; Invertebrates/physiology; Plants, Genetically Modified/metabolism; United Kingdom; Zea mays/physiology",Herbicides,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBS/E/C/00004179) United Kingdom,https://www.jstor.org/stable/3558306 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1693278 https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2003.1404 http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/358/1439/1879.full.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1693278/ https://repository.rothamsted.ac.uk/item/89081/invertebrates-and-vegetation-of-field-margins-adjacent-to-crops-subject-to-contrasting-herbicide-regimes-in-the-farm-scale-evaluations-of-genetically-modified-herbicide-tolerant-crops,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2003.1404,14561320,10.1098/rstb.2003.1404,2125179562,PMC1693278,0,002-840-565-989-288; 004-468-911-725-66X; 004-779-730-563-292; 007-243-303-723-240; 007-416-181-403-689; 008-167-536-662-383; 009-104-527-591-059; 017-536-261-562-232; 018-655-554-147-217; 019-009-566-684-01X; 021-985-199-664-948; 029-568-331-038-13X; 030-831-977-852-027; 031-712-522-366-166; 033-281-931-346-01X; 033-665-629-444-762; 033-679-811-867-654; 033-683-367-611-100; 039-505-502-984-134; 039-885-186-600-094; 042-287-420-054-457; 043-329-639-022-790; 043-498-137-571-498; 047-660-156-908-277; 049-266-111-686-604; 050-261-844-716-21X; 051-103-549-479-234; 051-706-259-809-963; 051-962-295-859-071; 053-168-406-486-023; 056-585-869-238-25X; 056-789-845-462-569; 062-153-336-512-189; 063-003-550-683-547; 063-024-434-156-048; 064-724-577-954-665; 064-774-143-587-947; 065-874-439-716-802; 072-985-277-248-326; 073-373-893-863-268; 073-797-947-467-295; 073-935-983-022-480; 073-977-220-319-580; 074-793-529-288-006; 077-623-747-437-53X; 078-068-143-214-104; 079-068-774-342-74X; 082-389-624-773-160; 084-909-192-012-059; 085-304-528-102-854; 085-784-696-938-816; 085-941-087-561-247; 089-107-465-655-218; 096-069-093-701-074; 098-359-078-842-74X; 105-301-641-863-030; 105-466-690-006-049; 106-390-550-523-43X; 109-980-584-368-57X; 114-480-653-531-829; 117-345-687-903-78X; 125-995-631-935-63X; 132-514-372-219-826; 136-211-299-945-625; 142-776-580-380-49X; 143-273-453-722-006; 151-368-087-827-60X; 154-386-144-197-99X; 158-345-384-701-811; 163-667-207-213-983; 165-804-108-473-473; 166-565-735-649-360; 171-352-683-438-394; 185-374-982-166-638; 195-100-863-120-148; 196-154-013-303-271,117

Martin Dors,"One-half of a 35- by 250-m riparian buffer cropped in corn (Zea mays L.) was seeded with fine leaf fescue (Festuca spp.) and allowed to remain idle to determine water quality changes resulting from riparian buffer restoration. A corn control was also used in this paired watershed design located in Connecticut. Water, N, and P fluxes were determined for precipitation, overland flow, and ground water. Also, an N mass balance was calculated. Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations significantly (P < 0.05) increased as ground water flowed through the restored buffer. Nitrate N (NOj-N) concentrations declined significantly but most (52%) of the decrease occurred within a 2.5-m wetland adjacent to the stream. An N mass balance for the 2.5-m strip indicated that denitrification only accounted for 1% of the N losses and plant uptake was from 7 to 13% of the N losses annually. Ground water was the dominant source of N to the buffer and also the dominant loss. Restoration of the riparian buffer decreased (p < 0.05) overland flow concentrations of TKN by 70%, NO3-N by 83%, TP by 73%, and total suspended solids (TSS) by 92% as compared with the control. Restoration reduced (p < 0.05) NOj-N concentrations in ground water by 35% as compared with the control. Underestimated denitrification and dilution by up welling ground water in the wetland area adjacent to the stream were believed to be primarily responsible for the decreasing NOj-N concentrations observed.",,,,,Animal science; Kjeldahl method; Riparian buffer; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science; Total suspended solids; Surface runoff; Wetland; Denitrification; Restoration ecology,,,,,http://lshs.tamu.edu/docs/lshs/end-notes/water quality changes from riparian buffer restoration in connec-4017261388/water quality changes from riparian buffer restoration in connecticut.pdf,http://lshs.tamu.edu/docs/lshs/end-notes/water quality changes from riparian buffer restoration in connec-4017261388/water quality changes from riparian buffer restoration in connecticut.pdf,,,2189527571,,0,,9

Population monitoring in such settings reveals substantial edge effects, although these have seldom been quantified. This study compares the abundance of common voleMicrotus arvalis (Pallas, 1778) populations at various distances from three types of wooded environment (hedgerow, copse and forest) and in two types of habitat (temporary and permanent grassland). In temporary grassland, substantial edge effects were detected along the boundaries of forests and hedgerows. At 100 m from the forest edge, voles were twice more abundant than at 50 m, four times more than at 25 m and eight times more than at 5 m. In permanent grassland, the edge effect was such that voles were practically absent up to 100 m from the forest edge. For both types of grassland, the edge effect was more pronounced for forest habitat than for hedgerows, that is, for elements with a large surface area of wooded environment. Our results suggest that landscape context may greatly affect the local abundance of voles. Given the considerable damage done byM. arvalis, the presence of wooded patches in grassland areas leads to lower vole densities in adjacent areas and this might be an alternative method to controlM. arvalis as a pest species.",54,1,51,60,Edge effects; Habitat; Ecology; Grassland; Vole; Population; Animal ecology; Species richness; Forest ecology; Biology,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03193137 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093046803 http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-article-eaddcbf7-1a3f-493d-9eec-f747421b1c7b,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf03193137,,10.1007/bf03193137,2092039991,,0,002-411-775-507-544; 004-623-287-312-083; 006-430-516-847-092; 006-990-509-627-951; 008-621-691-545-379; 010-660-547-857-574; 013-129-020-041-758; 013-404-357-075-527; 013-669-660-897-762; 013-856-408-532-458; 018-328-570-183-455; 019-145-858-479-866; 019-616-854-986-172; 021-775-765-294-991; 022-680-725-650-829; 023-530-715-359-504; 025-108-369-292-907; 030-312-070-426-578; 033-184-346-175-235; 034-003-137-725-510; 034-181-886-712-030; 034-622-397-369-949; 034-857-394-369-560; 039-970-784-830-881; 040-215-860-649-969; 041-766-313-905-174; 045-920-452-297-058; 046-432-930-558-771; 051-752-156-998-631; 057-332-914-601-179; 064-990-889-184-884; 066-347-110-782-638; 069-652-907-344-029; 069-926-405-096-403; 071-061-870-579-111; 071-112-182-713-097; 071-604-253-914-381; 072-610-179-157-577; 072-824-243-554-07X; 074-466-893-845-181; 074-499-929-325-374; 076-384-434-383-321; 080-490-561-720-822; 097-142-559-308-00X; 099-774-071-248-347; 101-938-485-412-766; 102-329-955-416-431; 103-348-929-033-891; 103-908-289-801-081; 104-150-907-503-410; 105-377-085-637-948; 109-205-126-614-852; 110-722-381-833-551; 111-700-491-355-975; 126-436-142-968-209; 135-883-559-011-411; 139-665-998-030-067; 140-804-099-486-389; 147-490-702-686-71X; 153-941-301-560-566; 155-645-018-834-572; 155-959-137-025-956; 164-527-023-362-054; 192-593-035-362-458,11

Mocanu; M. Dobre,"On slopes soils there take place important nutrient losses that inflict pollution of surface waters. The most lost nutrient is nitrogen yet the phosphorus from soluble fertilizers is also lost. These nutrients reach into surface waters where determine eutrophication phenomenon. In order to implement the objectives of Water Frame Directive 2000/60/CE there have been searched methods for mitigation the nutrient pollution from slope soils. These methods are: - the using of organic - mineral fertilizers (L120) instead of soluble phosphorus fertilizers (superphosphates); - buffer strips at the bottom of the slope;- filtering materials for water from creeks. The applying of these methods have contributed to the reduction of the nutrient losses (nitrogen and phosphorus) from slope soils with values ranging between 38-41% by applying organic - mineral fertilizer and by 52-64% when buffer strips were installed. The using of straw ballots as filtering materials for creek water has determined the reduction of nutrient losses by 72%. This way, the using of organic - mineral fertilizer on lignite base (L-120) has determined the diminishing of phosphorus losses on slope soils due to bonding phosphorus from this fertilizer in an organic - mineral matrix that speeds up the retrogradation and solubilisation processes of phosphorus. The using of grass buffer strips of 10 m wide on level curves at the bottom of the slope along Preajba creek has determined an obvious decreasing of the eroded soil quantity, of humus and nutrient losses due to better retention by root system and its higher density. Straw ballots across the course of a creek are a good filter for running waters. The straw action is similar with soil colloidal complex, they retain chemical ions from water like: NO3, NH4, K, PO4, etc. By using straw ballots there can be avoided the eutrophication phenomenon of the surface waters. The using of crops like natural and sown pasture as well as cereals could be a method to mitigate nutrient losses on slopes. Wide row crops should be avoided as much as possible.",45,2,85,89,Nutrient; Soil water; Eutrophication; Fertilizer; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Phosphorus; Humus; Agronomy; Nutrient pollution,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20143012859 https://www.rjas.ro/download/paper_version.paper_file.8caad04fea6a9a96.313538312e706466.pdf https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20143012859.html,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20143012859,,,2109175354,,0,151-137-977-379-10X,0

Local researches are; necessary to gain information on buffer performance, with particular emphasis on narrow buffers. The effect of a 6 m buffer strip; (BS) in reducing runoff, suspended solids and nutrients from a field growing maize, winter wheat and soybean was assessed in a; field experiment conducted in North-East Italy during 1998\u20132001. The BS was composed of two rows of regularly alternating; trees (Platanus hybrida Brot.) and shrubs (Viburnum opulus L.), with grass (Festuca arundinacea L.) in the inter-rows.; The BS reduced total runoff by 78% compared to no-BS, in which cumulative runoff depth was 231 mm over 4 years. With; no-BS runoff appeared to be influenced mostly by total rainfall, while with BS maximum rainfall intensity was more important.; The filtering effect of the BS reduced total suspended solids (TSS), particularly after the second year, when the median yearly; concentrations ranged from 0.28 to 0.99 mg L1 and were smaller than 0.14 mg L1, with no-BS and with BS respectively. The; combination of lower concentrations and runoff volumes significantly reduced TSS losses from 6.9 to 0.4 t ha1 over the entire; period.; A tendency to increased concentrations of all forms of N (total, nitrate and ammonium) while passing through the BS was; observed, but total N losses were reduced from 17.3 to 4.5 kg ha1 in terms of mass balance. On the contrary, P concentrations; were unmodified (soluble P), or lowered (total P) by the BS, reducing total losses by about 80%. The effect on total P, composed; mainly of sediment-bound forms, was related to particulate settling when passing through the BS.; A numerical index (Eutrophic Load Index), integrating water quality and runoff volumes, was created to evaluate the; eutrophication risk of runoff with or without the BS. It showed that the BS effect was mostly due to a reduction of runoff volumes; rather than improving the overall water quality",105,1-2,101,114,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2004.05.011,,10.1016/j.agee.2004.05.011,,,0,003-679-788-124-01X; 014-561-967-561-763; 017-011-845-333-503; 019-372-765-420-427; 034-468-599-710-065; 038-659-320-814-260; 045-573-628-287-109; 046-747-744-517-198; 055-590-572-243-787; 056-444-102-079-143; 057-289-050-369-569; 068-997-932-046-194; 076-826-572-086-275; 082-797-391-654-568; 095-869-161-076-004; 111-288-588-656-115; 115-642-860-718-878; 130-940-780-158-38X; 132-186-585-542-192; 133-773-961-663-944; 136-078-117-326-445; 150-539-908-471-485,116

Berns; James Robertson Thomson; Timothy R. Cavagnaro,"Abstract Riparian zones are prominent features of agricultural landscapes because they are the last point to intercept nutrients and sediments before they enter water bodies. We investigated the soil properties, nutrient dynamics and vegetation composition at the riparian–agriculture interface. Soil physicochemical and vegetation properties were spatially heterogeneous along the transition from the grazed paddock into the un-grazed and revegetated riparian zone. Soil C stocks varied considerably across the site, with values ranging from 2% in the paddock to 5% in the riparian zone. Using Bayesian model selection, a predictive model for total soil carbon was developed. By including soil moisture content and canopy cover in the model, it was possible to predict total soil carbon with 80% accuracy at the site level and 87% at the transect level. This opens up the potential for total soil carbon levels to be estimated by the quantification of easily measured ecosystem properties. Analysis of the chemical nature of the carbon in theses soils by solid state 13C NMR spectroscopy, showed the presence of more recalcitrant forms of carbon in the revegetated riparian zone compared to the grazed paddock. Spatial patterns of soil mineral N pools were highly variable ( NO 4 + − N ranged from 1 to 5 μg/g dry soil; NO 3 − − N ranged from 0.4 to 2.2 μg/g dry soil); however, clear patterns in potentially mineralizable N (PMN) were observed, with rates of PMN in the paddock being less than half of those adjacent to the stream in the riparian zone. Results are discussed in the context of the dynamic nature of soil processes at the agriculture – riparian interface, and the potential to develop models to predict soil carbon using easily measurable vegetation and soil properties.",49,,38,45,Ecosystem; Riparian zone; Nutrient; Soil respiration; Soil science; Soil water; Soil type; Vegetation; Environmental science; Soil carbon,,,,"School of Biological Sciences, Monash University; Murray Darling Basin Authority",https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/spatial-patterns-of-and-environmental-controls-on-soil-properties https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/85276 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071712000594 https://researchprofiles.canberra.edu.au/en/publications/spatial-patterns-of-and-environmental-controls-on-soil-properties https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND44711719,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.02.007,,10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.02.007,1996038362,,0,000-689-702-074-331; 001-795-263-587-703; 002-275-102-975-34X; 002-509-409-482-215; 003-070-455-950-76X; 004-681-753-085-507; 005-222-102-566-554; 010-721-728-527-802; 011-518-513-609-045; 013-804-069-132-745; 014-424-124-887-035; 015-325-416-202-141; 015-342-032-824-51X; 015-514-563-181-208; 015-663-738-126-876; 016-497-800-437-698; 017-790-054-259-381; 018-777-402-329-391; 019-059-307-571-358; 023-347-970-237-621; 024-654-113-296-068; 026-982-189-141-084; 028-523-723-732-969; 030-978-497-436-303; 031-761-918-218-654; 033-786-985-984-424; 034-937-691-844-161; 037-655-209-344-331; 038-957-837-584-985; 046-884-682-520-13X; 047-944-768-655-674; 050-422-766-249-680; 055-445-976-825-678; 059-115-205-484-223; 059-320-896-313-943; 063-195-664-323-047; 063-431-083-337-274; 063-905-394-853-542; 064-336-761-270-306; 068-295-058-229-480; 069-215-520-224-22X; 072-198-130-972-325; 073-681-033-142-000; 075-207-343-378-670; 077-138-259-642-965; 081-030-794-566-327; 084-585-749-983-736; 084-940-408-826-883; 089-365-869-459-178; 098-936-549-472-982; 098-962-715-174-163; 101-990-703-232-260; 102-215-185-600-703; 102-274-227-250-423; 110-713-293-177-238; 118-128-311-468-279; 119-917-653-547-784; 120-795-373-876-586; 138-125-520-594-759; 145-866-195-493-445; 149-006-883-920-063; 165-628-763-557-921; 169-993-554-881-216; 186-248-770-128-006,31

Buffer zones are wide field boundaries established to prevent nutrient leaching and erosion into waterways and serve as habitats for farmland wildlife. Our main hypothesis was that several years of grazing or cutting management results in greater plant species richness and heterogeneity in buffer zones in comparison with sites managed for only a few years. We also hypothesized that litter cover and soil phosphorus (P) level would decrease after several years of management, in comparison sites with relatively few years of management. Through this study we aimed to gain a better understanding of how to increase biodiversity in buffer zones. The study included 15 buffer zones within a single landscape. Mean species richness was significantly higher in the group of sites grazed over several years (21 species) in contrast to extensively cut sites (14.8 species) and/or grazed sites (18 species). Species heterogeneity did not respond to different management regimes. Management, slope aspect and litter were significant explanatory factors for species composition. The amount of soil phosphorus measured at three different depths was significantly lower in the buffer zones managed by cutting or grazing for a few years in contrast to those that were grazed for several years. Management that positively affected species diversity did not result in the expected decrease in soil phosphorus. Therefore, we propose that the greater species richness at grazed sites results mainly from disturbances caused by grazing.",1,2,152,161,Biodiversity; Habitat; Ecology; Grazing; Litter; Soil fertility; Environmental science; Plant community; Species richness; Species diversity; Agronomy,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20133133419.html https://ideas.repec.org/a/ags/ccsesa/231368.html https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/231368 https://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/sar/article/view/16165/0 https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ags:ccsesa:231368 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20133133419 https://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/sar/article/download/16165/12821,http://dx.doi.org/10.5539/sar.v1n2p152,,10.5539/sar.v1n2p152,1990402253,,0,002-832-393-044-316; 003-461-880-854-275; 005-769-046-282-205; 007-243-303-723-240; 007-991-211-083-083; 008-292-810-248-496; 014-226-881-970-330; 015-072-120-385-142; 018-028-975-115-624; 021-446-234-610-871; 022-418-213-259-750; 026-162-389-848-750; 031-587-910-976-142; 035-826-622-559-02X; 041-704-628-510-931; 046-513-869-126-279; 063-003-550-683-547; 064-975-099-130-640; 070-239-213-610-528; 071-543-579-732-418; 076-663-121-778-500; 099-437-976-818-570; 110-743-613-765-547; 119-139-897-303-411; 120-262-642-164-869; 125-665-410-415-022; 128-760-888-268-265; 132-380-117-709-640; 137-863-970-555-683; 139-587-466-264-697; 146-589-148-444-417; 153-263-834-766-903; 155-691-175-864-748; 158-040-572-868-750; 160-439-290-292-948; 161-300-804-429-199; 169-228-174-821-424; 176-664-883-657-81X,2

Walsh; Stephen Harris,"The selection of foraging habitats by vespertilionid bats in Britain was quantified using a stratified sample of 1030 1-km squares. Quantitative analysis of habitat preference and avoidance on a large scale indicated that bats were flexible, yet consistent in their habitat use across contrasting landscapes. Habitats associated with broadleaved woodland and water were most preferred, while arable land, moorland and improved grassland were strongly avoided. Linear vegetation features were selected in all landscapes, demonstrating the importance of habitat continuity to bats. The availability of preferred habitats was low and patchy in all landscapes, indicating that bats have specialized habitat requirements. Differences in habitat selection between landscape types and possible factors influencing habitat selection are discussed. Habitat selection analysed on a local scale demonstrated the same consistent preference for woodland, riparian and corridor habitats across 19 discrete land classes. Management policies for bats in Britain should endeavour to preserve and enhance the availability of woodland, water margins and linear corridor habitats. Lack of continuity of the landscape, loss and fragmentation of habitat patches plus deterioration of the quality of such patches may pose a threat to bat populations.",33,3,508,518,Riparian zone; Habitat fragmentation; Wildlife conservation; Moorland; Foraging; Habitat; Ecology; Woodland; Geography; Nyctalus,,,,,https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/publications/foraging-habitat-preferences-of-vespertilionid-bats-in-britain(2a68568f-7e81-4b74-89c6-27208d07d892)/export.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2404980,,10.2307/2404980,2053103706,,0,003-499-677-226-170; 003-950-212-675-332; 011-833-385-429-663; 013-422-247-361-88X; 018-569-093-632-12X; 020-205-867-945-248; 021-408-404-134-285; 026-033-335-273-030; 026-257-709-422-727; 026-368-982-927-349; 027-476-225-601-16X; 029-545-745-233-582; 030-197-706-510-206; 033-900-773-196-908; 035-621-354-748-000; 036-694-672-180-784; 039-071-513-064-012; 041-796-136-512-528; 044-059-709-481-060; 045-429-572-565-600; 051-614-860-275-28X; 064-944-144-468-13X; 070-543-171-240-878; 082-141-692-225-087; 098-050-878-878-26X; 098-510-221-047-458; 098-790-936-571-084; 110-102-748-134-232; 119-016-539-299-643; 119-648-737-536-334; 139-925-275-874-811; 150-471-241-811-534; 162-950-366-029-259; 175-753-583-141-764; 181-004-796-247-414,236

Marino; Katherine L. Gross; Douglas A. Landis,"The influence of weed seed predation by invertebrates and vertebrates was examined in relation to distance from hedgerows in maize fields of southwestern Michigan. Experiments were conducted in spring and winter and included five common weed species, i.e., velvet-leaf (Abutilon theophrasti), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), common lamb's-quarters (Chenopodium album), fall panicum (Panicum dichotom~florum), and yellow foxtail (Setaria lutescens). In the spring post-tillage study, treatments excluding invertebrates, vertebrates, invertebrates + vertebrates plus no exclusion controls were established at 5 and 100 m from the hedgerow. Seeds were placed into the field in trays filled with sterilized soil at low densities to avoid creating a 'super stimulus' for seed predators. The trays were placed in the field for 3-4 weeks and then placed in a heated greenhouse and seed loss was estimated from the number of seedlings that emerged. The design of the winter study was similar except that only control and vertebrate exclusion treatments were used and seeds were left in the field from December to mid-April. Significant differences among exclusion treatments were found in spring in terms of seed loss. Seed loss was lowest in the treatments that excluded both vertebrates + invertebrates and highest under no exclusion. There was some evidence of preferential predation by vertebrates upon seeds of A. retroflexus and C. album. In winter, significant seed predation by vertebrates on all species except A. retrqflexus were detected. In both seasons, seed predation was highly patchy among and within fields and there was no consistent effect of distance from hedgerow. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",66,3,189,196,Foxtail; Predation; Weed; Setaria; Seed predation; Chenopodium; Panicum; Poaceae; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://lter.kbs.msu.edu/citations/2822 https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND20614213 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167880997000911,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-8809(97)00091-1,,10.1016/s0167-8809(97)00091-1,2090912306,,0,005-890-264-514-021; 007-560-497-707-669; 009-734-180-719-581; 012-335-108-074-344; 015-479-304-278-098; 015-992-794-373-22X; 016-902-194-539-761; 016-963-200-937-002; 022-070-333-305-083; 023-487-127-123-633; 027-405-522-971-388; 030-652-847-337-20X; 040-907-443-467-66X; 043-155-766-199-743; 044-503-358-920-890; 051-103-549-479-234; 055-107-013-670-19X; 055-880-252-517-625; 056-587-738-715-983; 056-892-041-411-85X; 057-655-484-758-059; 067-639-922-939-929; 069-658-689-669-091; 073-233-781-459-995; 087-186-786-234-321; 088-037-955-485-509; 098-371-908-959-034; 100-986-860-964-168; 102-406-587-823-32X; 104-056-309-665-566; 120-425-598-977-443; 148-680-462-415-331; 151-370-073-476-020; 151-583-726-175-217; 187-050-769-304-212,69

Peterjohn; David L. Correll,"Nutrient (C, N, and P) concentration changes were measured in surface runoff and shallow groundwater as they moved through a small agricultural (cropland) watershed located in Maryland. During the study period (March 1981 to March 1982), dramatic changes in water-borne nutrient loads occurred in the riparian forest of the watershed. From surface runoff waters that had transited : 50 m of riparian forest, an estimated 4.1 Mg of particulates, 1I kg of particulate organic-N, 0.83 kg of ammonium-N, 2.7 kg of nitrate-N and 3.0 kg of total particulate-P per ha of riparian forest were removed during the study year. In addition, an estimated removal of 45 kg ha- yr-t of nitrate- N occurred in subsurface flow as it moved through the riparian zone. Nutrient uptake rates for the cropland and riparian forest were estimated. These systems were then compared with respect to their pathways of nutrient flow and ability to retain nutrients. The cropland appeared to retain fewer nutrients than the riparian forest and is thought to incur the majority of its nutrient losses in harvested crop. The dominant pathway of total-N loss from the riparian forest seemed to be subsurface flux. Total phosphorus loss from the riparian forest appeared almost evenly divided between surface and subsurface losses. Nutrient removals in the riparian forest are thought to be of ecological significance to receiving waters and indicate that coupling natural systems and managed habitats within a watershed may reduce diffuse-source pollution.",65,5,1466,1475,Subsurface flow; Riparian zone; Nutrient; Riparian forest; Watershed; Ecology; Riparian buffer; Environmental science; Agroecosystem; Hydrology (agriculture),,,,,https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1939127 https://repository.si.edu/handle/10088/2963 http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2307/1939127 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/1939127/full https://www.jstor.org/stable/1939127 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/1939127/abstract https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/1939127 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/1939127,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1939127,,10.2307/1939127,2023102110,,0,006-720-679-020-108; 012-812-820-589-949; 023-997-936-057-71X; 029-274-571-592-996; 045-564-520-243-257; 061-144-631-816-715; 066-567-733-926-583; 068-103-192-817-030; 074-893-268-828-550; 079-789-931-625-023; 145-946-471-329-378,1487
141-452-852-502-431,How to catch foliage‐dwelling spiders (Araneae) in maize fields and their margins: a comparison of two sampling methods,,2004,journal article,Journal of Applied Entomology,09312048; 14390418,Wiley,United Kingdom,C. Ludy; A. Lang,":; ; The foliage-dwelling spider fauna was collected in maize fields and on stinging nettles in adjacent margins in Bavaria, South Germany. Two different sampling methods were evaluated: drop cloth sampling and suction sampling. The overall catch was dominated by juvenile spiders, web-building spiders, and spiders of the families Theridiidae, Linyphiidae, Tetragnathidae and Araneidae (in decreasing order). Field margins harboured more species than maize fields, whereas the total spider abundance was higher in the maize crop. Web-building spiders such as Theridiidae and Linyphiidae were prominent in maize by individual numbers. Suction sampling with a small suction device proved to be a more efficient and consistent sampling method for foliage-dwelling spiders than drop cloth sampling. Density and species richness of foliage-dwelling spiders in maize was shown to be fairly high, implying that spiders of higher strata may play a more important role in biological control than suspected up to now.",128,7,501,509,Biological pest control; Fauna; Ecology; Theridiidae; Linyphiidae; Spider; Poaceae; Species richness; Biology; Sampling (statistics),,,,,https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND43640667,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2004.00880.x,,10.1111/j.1439-0418.2004.00880.x,2024366566,,0,002-640-234-073-682; 008-057-285-925-144; 018-165-136-763-947; 018-202-918-339-630; 019-286-238-463-002; 023-306-285-805-706; 032-683-791-612-712; 038-442-778-043-35X; 040-815-928-482-982; 042-904-615-319-356; 048-636-936-576-804; 056-789-845-462-569; 062-036-445-726-722; 063-391-168-907-164; 070-703-492-655-943; 081-565-912-450-722; 083-548-052-552-910; 086-419-085-554-996; 092-151-348-850-74X; 096-678-784-734-661; 109-962-233-353-844; 117-345-687-903-78X; 118-409-347-010-789; 128-990-300-489-15X; 163-029-689-861-775; 182-239-079-542-595,13

The variation in taxonomic composition, community attributes and trophic structure of fish assemblages from streams under different riparian zone preservation conditions were studied. Nine stream reaches under the following riparian vegetation conditions were selected: Native Forest (NF), with mostly primary forest; Secondary Forest (SF), which included sites with vegetation in an advanced stage of regeneration surrounded by sugarcane plantations; and Sugarcane sites (SC), located in areas without riparian vegetation, adjacent to sugarcane crops. Forty-one species were collected. The variance partitioning and partial Redundancy Analysis (pRDA) indicated that community composition and trophic structure were significantly explained by riparian condition and spatial variations, while diversity, richness, abundance and biomass were only explained by season and space, with higher diversity and richness at the SF sites. Abundance-Biomass curves (ABC curves) suggested that sugarcane plantations destabilized fish assemblages, especially at the more intensively managed sites, which seem to influence stream integrity and associated fish fauna. We concluded that both physical conditions of streams and some attributes of fish communities reflected the different levels of preservation of the riparian buffers, but given the influence of regional processes which have a pervasive role in shaping local assemblages, land use at the watershed scale seemed to be important especially to explain the higher richness and diversity found at the SF sites.",98,8,1895,1912,Biomass (ecology); Riparian zone; Old-growth forest; Secondary forest; Vegetation; Ecology; Geography; Species richness; Agroforestry; Species diversity; Trophic level,,,,,https://www.bv.fapesp.br/en/publicacao/108664/assessing-the-importance-of-the-riparian-zone-for-stream-fis/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10641-015-0406-4/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10641-015-0406-4 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153285399 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/4394803,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-015-0406-4,,10.1007/s10641-015-0406-4,1981295327,,0,001-119-833-238-908; 001-141-218-793-388; 002-566-488-175-248; 003-171-724-444-914; 003-828-350-015-536; 005-073-055-538-326; 007-751-641-582-496; 008-583-288-343-270; 010-304-324-945-621; 010-897-871-428-494; 013-053-656-704-352; 013-228-412-257-762; 014-247-748-409-336; 015-342-032-824-51X; 015-764-269-828-682; 016-720-816-366-715; 018-797-363-505-484; 019-026-359-992-284; 019-065-946-135-668; 020-424-424-061-013; 020-630-627-088-31X; 022-918-849-279-15X; 023-205-757-860-322; 023-489-529-211-555; 023-650-799-291-696; 024-945-044-153-791; 026-585-485-948-932; 029-264-530-643-997; 029-386-831-957-40X; 032-461-732-375-661; 032-961-767-789-531; 035-093-656-083-327; 036-334-291-932-197; 036-749-081-343-479; 039-172-718-674-79X; 039-251-416-279-052; 042-036-539-281-458; 043-784-111-122-333; 045-304-006-438-587; 045-739-664-884-434; 045-818-830-294-17X; 046-520-504-626-786; 047-089-650-693-822; 047-800-807-474-540; 048-818-224-648-416; 050-813-918-820-312; 052-334-333-625-946; 052-434-564-418-432; 055-386-300-233-43X; 061-359-597-187-246; 062-840-277-915-897; 065-243-399-060-376; 066-318-658-327-89X; 067-256-246-817-599; 068-051-732-934-472; 070-024-067-817-548; 075-310-223-214-175; 080-055-492-305-521; 081-240-152-729-265; 082-121-932-561-402; 085-959-277-823-856; 086-802-354-961-613; 090-176-681-950-734; 090-857-350-394-204; 098-207-542-666-960; 101-972-318-570-424; 104-441-312-226-717; 104-529-546-001-437; 106-097-003-134-387; 108-159-820-046-364; 109-280-597-605-629; 109-645-497-961-115; 112-155-295-547-828; 114-134-813-729-913; 119-139-897-303-411; 120-138-371-686-172; 120-871-791-484-413; 122-154-985-613-384; 122-936-707-834-079; 123-337-490-665-80X; 124-548-416-367-157; 128-373-399-847-303; 128-498-727-256-916; 129-760-874-861-398; 130-522-423-394-518; 135-218-961-934-644; 139-432-224-057-058; 140-201-605-957-524; 148-437-157-711-433; 150-325-162-873-23X; 150-443-926-207-649; 150-913-091-793-742; 155-238-296-972-934; 163-699-856-957-831; 169-358-463-559-157; 174-261-044-357-737; 176-100-710-487-88X; 184-962-236-860-868; 189-006-079-832-653; 197-396-386-762-655; 199-662-893-082-47X,29

If properly designed, they can provide multiple environmental benefits by increasing wildlife habitats and biodiversity. Little attention has been paid to the effects of buffer strips on soil quality. This study was conducted to determine the impact of different buffer designs on soil biochemical parameters and to define relevant quality parameters for soil monitoring. We compared four buffer arrangements: 3 m wide grass buffer; 3 m grass with one tree row; 6 m grass with one tree row; 6 m grass with two tree rows; plus two controls: an adjacent maize crop field and a plot without buffer. Buffers were established 13 years ago at the Padua University Experimental Farm in the Po Valley, north-east Italy. Studied parameters included soil organic matter composition and soil microbial and enzymatic assays. As expected, control plots showed the lowest values for all the studied parameters. Among buffer designs, 3 m grass and 3 m grass with 1 tree row buffers gave the highest values. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the increase of soil organic carbon content distinguished buffers from controls, whereas soil humic carbon quality parameters such as humic compounds apparent molecular weight, together with acetyl esterase (fluorescein test) enzyme activity, were discriminatory in separating buffer designs. These results are an important contribution to the knowledge base and can help to improve the management of these systems.",80,,67,76,Biodiversity; Buffer (optical fiber); Composition (visual arts); Soil organic matter; Ecology; Soil quality; Riparian buffer; Environmental science; Soil carbon; Buffer strip; Agronomy,,,,,https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND605356285 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139314001115 https://core.ac.uk/display/53511229 https://www.research.unipd.it/handle/11577/3012899 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139314001115,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2014.04.003,,10.1016/j.apsoil.2014.04.003,2024848691,,0,001-218-196-204-484; 003-495-641-561-34X; 005-432-755-043-801; 006-435-116-751-748; 007-419-965-776-225; 008-208-990-881-816; 008-236-544-077-543; 015-620-073-261-95X; 015-669-020-241-709; 017-640-430-568-126; 017-722-576-331-809; 019-622-915-734-27X; 021-167-413-258-867; 022-392-272-851-268; 022-906-204-859-431; 023-974-395-989-220; 025-555-690-117-595; 025-600-076-877-033; 028-034-500-501-517; 029-320-718-836-727; 031-747-379-131-830; 033-344-612-422-797; 033-694-134-687-669; 034-568-202-684-03X; 034-791-938-302-446; 036-456-610-975-852; 039-245-725-682-055; 039-728-327-816-405; 042-797-830-861-884; 044-214-456-182-827; 044-537-569-855-131; 045-527-141-837-781; 045-712-854-553-759; 046-634-754-744-326; 046-683-162-505-680; 046-704-989-620-302; 050-215-077-665-388; 051-077-809-327-370; 054-883-047-283-337; 056-572-672-082-930; 059-003-128-993-115; 060-139-415-253-310; 068-481-458-698-605; 072-797-257-428-487; 075-564-908-027-524; 076-636-159-706-373; 078-324-750-314-297; 078-605-959-620-712; 080-086-175-670-914; 081-887-331-851-482; 081-987-516-254-404; 082-679-970-201-398; 082-758-372-983-911; 084-119-071-425-213; 084-462-196-617-305; 084-492-930-291-651; 087-042-405-077-797; 089-918-061-931-289; 090-007-042-413-206; 090-715-551-311-15X; 091-776-260-369-744; 092-941-160-711-170; 095-396-521-604-871; 096-499-726-729-908; 100-679-216-297-456; 105-842-327-723-357; 106-977-471-664-288; 109-026-052-055-707; 111-909-586-210-231; 112-183-171-784-539; 114-772-538-209-249; 117-494-465-585-519; 131-205-072-727-938; 134-437-470-996-289; 139-395-765-436-86X; 148-343-253-624-949; 152-157-521-163-436; 157-684-890-376-839; 157-974-656-575-165; 158-450-821-087-317; 159-237-134-366-844; 159-359-733-987-293; 160-034-774-619-227; 171-583-803-939-694; 178-140-173-536-98X; 184-325-051-373-391; 189-138-078-746-651; 191-147-319-900-194,19

Redhead; A.J. Vanbergen; L. Hulmes; S. Hulmes; J. Peyton; M. Nowakowski; R.F. Pywell; M.S. Heard,"This study investigated how local habitat type and landscape structure affects the biomass, species richness and functional diversity of ground beetles sampled from a 1000 ha UK arable farm. At a local scale habitat type was either crop (winter wheat and oilseed rape) or one of five field margin habitats. Surrounding each of these sampling areas, landscape structure was defined using remote sensed data from Specim AISA Eagle (400–970 nm) and Hawk (970–2450 nm) hyperspectral sensors. Ground beetles were divided into predatory and phytophagous trophic levels. Local habitat type only affected phytophagous ground beetle biomass, which was lowest within crops. Total biomass of predatory beetles was negatively correlated, and species richness positively correlated, with landscape habitat diversity. Only the functional diversity of predatory ground beetles responded to landscape structure, showing positive correlations with the proportion of Tussock Grass field margins. Predatory ground beetles show a greater dependence on landscape structure than phytophagous species, a response that is attributed to their high mobility needed for movement between dynamically variable food resources",139,1-2,181,186,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2010.07.018,,10.1016/j.agee.2010.07.018,,,0,,89
145-176-906-866-327,Grass strip corridors in agricultural landscapes enhance nest-site colonization by solitary wasps.,,2009,journal article,Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America,10510761; 19395582,Wiley-Blackwell,United States,Andrea Holzschuh; Ingolf Steffan-Dewenter; Teja Tscharntke,"Corridors that connect otherwise isolated habitats have often been proposed as a management strategy to mitigate negative effects of habitat fragmentation. Non-crop corridors may have the potential to enhance the connectivity for arthropod predators in cropland landscapes, especially for species that require multiple habitats, such as cavity-nesting wasps which use wooded habitat for nesting and grassland habitat for foraging. However, the effects of corridors in nonexperimental landscapes have been rarely examined. We studied the species richness and abundance of cavity-nesting wasps and their parasitoids in standardized trap nests located in three habitat types (forest edge, hedge, grass strip) and in three grass-strip types (connected to a forest edge, slightly isolated, highly isolated from a forest edge). Species richness and the abundance of wasps (Hymenoptera: Sphecidae, Eumenidae, Pompilidae) were highest at forest edges, which provide natural nesting sites, and lowest in grass strips, with few natural nesting sites. Wasp abundance in grass strips connected to forest edges was 270% higher than in slightly isolated grass strips and 600% higher than in highly isolated grass strips. The abundance of caterpillar-hunting eumenid wasps was 600% higher in connected grass strips than in slightly and highly isolated grass strips. Species richness of wasps was enhanced by 180% in connected grass strips compared to highly isolated grass strips. Parasitism rates were not directly influenced by habitat or grass-strip type, but increased with increasing parasitoid diversity that was higher at forest edges than in grass strips. We conclude that grass-strip corridors enhance the colonization of nesting sites, presumably by facilitating wasp movements. In agricultural landscapes, where nesting sites are limited and food availability changes frequently, rapid colonization of nests may enhance population viability. Higher wasp abundance in connected nesting sites may be directly linked to higher biocontrol of pest caterpillars within the foraging range around nests. Although grass strips can reduce the negative effects of habitat fragmentation, non-crop habitats such as forest habitats and hedges providing nesting sites are required within the home range of wasps to allow reproduction in agricultural landscapes.",19,1,123,132,Habitat fragmentation; Foraging; Habitat; Ecology; Parasitoid; Sphecidae; Hymenoptera; Population; Species richness; Biology,,"Agriculture/methods; Animals; Ecosystem; Host-Parasite Interactions; Nesting Behavior/physiology; Pest Control, Biological; Poaceae; Predatory Behavior; Trees; Wasps/parasitology",,,"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/08-0384.1 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/2159578 https://eref.uni-bayreuth.de/16299/ http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/08-0384.1/abstract https://europepmc.org/article/MED/19323177 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19323177 http://www.bayceer.uni-bayreuth.de/bayceer/de/pub/pub/68215/EcolAppl2009,19_123-132_Holzschuh_et-al.pdf https://www.jstor.org/stable/27645953 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093076257 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/08-0384.1",http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-0384.1,19323177,10.1890/08-0384.1,1986454600,,0,000-470-717-455-915; 001-246-459-283-910; 001-555-373-960-238; 002-874-438-870-319; 003-164-963-858-748; 004-355-918-923-334; 004-916-984-876-81X; 008-225-619-668-580; 008-291-203-169-732; 009-798-888-154-531; 011-113-313-615-090; 011-886-495-134-718; 012-333-562-833-591; 013-210-533-072-945; 016-220-845-242-163; 018-209-687-890-039; 026-524-247-263-808; 026-735-761-517-671; 027-867-910-497-397; 030-989-751-486-255; 033-622-591-677-498; 034-594-579-129-457; 035-087-499-153-22X; 035-775-229-294-961; 041-616-757-175-973; 043-023-106-534-265; 043-334-181-578-717; 043-354-445-798-712; 043-455-371-359-823; 045-445-063-674-649; 049-091-169-377-597; 049-346-208-924-920; 050-137-130-449-043; 054-328-419-977-493; 054-715-078-148-813; 055-439-916-692-702; 056-064-713-708-207; 057-420-111-160-322; 062-218-780-389-812; 065-357-116-922-518; 066-376-824-715-720; 067-277-473-537-389; 068-452-604-669-157; 072-547-204-496-863; 073-335-262-644-942; 075-182-328-430-399; 075-666-685-673-883; 076-307-235-228-944; 080-348-794-816-190; 089-762-789-750-124; 093-579-516-936-299; 098-312-271-690-700; 099-188-994-062-936; 104-625-941-609-08X; 105-377-085-637-948; 108-617-736-483-655; 113-194-919-014-308; 114-638-686-339-814; 129-559-145-122-865; 146-382-118-408-345; 146-977-228-707-912; 148-510-873-134-137; 154-978-657-665-321; 155-691-175-864-748; 156-547-582-169-232; 166-248-084-772-47X,71

Winter survival was lowest for beetles enclosed on bare earth and highest for those enclosed on tussocks of Dactylis glomerata. The contrast in structural complexity of the experimental treatments caused a 44%, 43% and 36% variation in the final densities of beetles during three successive winters.

The results have been compared with those from 70-m-long and 18-m-wide plots without buffers (NBS). Surface and subsurface water to a depth of 30 cm were sampled, soil and plant samples taken from the buffers for nutrient analyses. Spring barley or oats were grown on the field in 1991–2002 and dairy cows grazed on the grassed field and grazed grass buffer strips (gGBS) in 2003–2005. Buffer strips decreased losses of sediment, total P and total N by 60, 40 and 40–60% in surface run-off from a cropped field. However, the loss of PO4-P was 70% higher from the field with the non-harvested VBS than from the field without buffers (NBS). On the pasture, erosion and N losses were quite low, whereas PO4-P losses from all treatments were rather high. The high loss of PO4-P from the VBS and pasture was most likely due to PO4-P leaching from the soil surface and decaying grass residue in spring.",,,,,Subsurface flow; Leaching (agriculture); Nutrient; Pasture; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Surface runoff; Soil test; Nitrogen; Agronomy,,,,,http://orgprints.org/16224/1/pollutants.pdf https://orgprints.org/16224/,https://orgprints.org/16224/,,,2166279185,,0,010-499-008-581-398; 077-418-118-294-000; 088-236-621-248-724; 111-229-567-477-96X; 180-199-671-970-680; 182-249-166-887-857,0

In this study, we show that landscapes composed of higher proportions of organic crop fields support more bee species at greater abundances in fallow strips. An increase in organic cropping in the surrounding landscape from 5% to 20% enhanced bee species richness in fallow strips by 50%, density of solitary bees by 60% and bumble bee density by 150%. Bee species richness and bumble bee density responded strongest to organic cropping in landscape sectors with 500 m radius, solitary bee density in landscape sectors with 250 m radius. The most likely source of these results is that crop and noncrop habitats are strongly connected via bee foraging at the landscape scale. It seems likely that bees depending on nesting sites in fallow strips benefited from the more abundant flower resources provided by broadleaved weeds in organic crop fields. We conclude that the incorporation of organic crop fields into conventionally managed agricultural landscapes can provide food resources needed to sustain greater pollinator species richness in noncrop habitats.",117,3,354,361,Pollinator; Cropping; Crop; Foraging; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Weed; Species richness; Flor,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ingolf_Steffan-Dewenter/publication/227540684_Agricultural_landscapes_with_organic_crops_support_higher_pollinator_diversity/links/0deec51d6ce982d18d000000.pdf http://www.bayceer.uni-bayreuth.de/bayceer/en/pub/html/Oikos_2008_117_354_361_Holzschuh_et_al.pdf https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.16303.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.16303.x,,10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.16303.x,1978500916,,0,001-714-225-412-729; 002-133-948-308-90X; 004-916-984-876-81X; 007-590-189-380-964; 008-225-619-668-580; 011-113-313-615-090; 011-363-201-170-412; 011-508-246-956-659; 012-267-243-122-028; 012-539-445-932-252; 013-144-739-926-739; 014-590-282-698-428; 015-348-182-108-487; 016-204-638-673-374; 023-935-502-746-047; 025-775-649-567-265; 025-936-176-187-610; 031-862-039-493-29X; 035-138-891-064-544; 035-775-229-294-961; 045-445-063-674-649; 048-797-051-736-10X; 054-274-474-416-858; 056-099-523-856-735; 056-789-845-462-569; 057-179-192-885-14X; 057-420-111-160-322; 057-720-330-037-206; 059-361-082-177-816; 060-086-333-706-623; 068-452-604-669-157; 069-083-458-833-742; 077-277-772-557-227; 079-260-505-568-02X; 080-348-794-816-190; 084-387-070-806-39X; 086-096-752-108-057; 086-525-130-009-786; 087-142-832-914-033; 094-542-264-880-862; 097-061-486-668-498; 098-312-271-690-700; 102-049-479-595-742; 103-348-929-033-891; 105-301-641-863-030; 112-917-317-852-89X; 114-638-686-339-814; 115-537-551-650-895; 117-345-687-903-78X; 121-230-767-263-342; 151-368-087-827-60X; 154-386-144-197-99X; 158-918-322-327-41X; 185-374-982-166-638,226

Owens; J. H. Duzant; L. K. Deeks; G. A. Wood; R. P. C. Morgan; A. J. Collins,"There are a variety of buffering features within the landscape that can be used to trap sediment and associated contaminants such as phosphorus (P), thereby helping to reduce sediment and P delivery to watercourses. Astroturf mats (n = 136) were placed within contrasting buffer features at nine sites [mid-field hedges (two sites), edge-of-field grass strips (six sites) and channel wetlands (one site)] within the River Parrett basin in England. Sediment was recorded on the mats at seven of the sites during the 18-month sampling period. At the other two sites either there was insufficient erosion or sediment by-passed the mats. At the seven sites where mats collected sediment, there was a considerable range in sediment deposition over the 18-month sampling period with site-average values (based on all mats at a site) ranging from 0.02 ± 0.06 to 1.15 ± 1.88 g cm )2 ; the average for all 136 mats was 0.41 ± 1.08 g cm )2 , or approximately 0.27 g cm )2 year )1 . Most of the sediment collected on the mats (n = 60) was sand-sized (>63 lm) material. The site-average total-P content of the <63 lm fraction of the deposited sediment ranged between 616 and 1938 mg kg )1 (average 890 mg kg )1 ). About half of all the mats that collected sediment were from the front of the buffers. Comparison of the sediment in the buffer features with topsoil from the contributing upslope fields suggests that the buffers trap coarser sediment with lower P concentrations, than the contributing topsoil. This suggests that the finer fraction, enriched in total-P, may be passing through the buffers towards river channels. Comparison between sites indicates that sediment deposition within buffers is greater at sites with steeper slopes, erodible soils and certain types of land use, such as maize for silage, reflecting the greater soil erosion and sediment transfers in these fields. The location and careful design of buffer features is a key factor in their effectiveness.",23,s1,165,175,Structural basin; Erosion; Soil science; Soil water; Topsoil; Water quality; Sediment; Hydrology; Environmental science; Phosphorus; Wetland,,,,,http://www.unbc.ca/sites/default/files/assets/owens/sum_2007.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-2743.2007.00121.x,,10.1111/j.1475-2743.2007.00121.x,2165527671,,0,000-993-037-975-442; 002-650-706-842-54X; 005-155-501-929-87X; 012-446-523-009-04X; 013-102-351-520-868; 013-754-411-660-349; 015-962-766-860-234; 018-782-068-505-076; 020-317-677-874-537; 030-897-584-332-17X; 040-520-882-050-376; 042-036-288-239-561; 044-558-970-835-156; 049-773-598-549-535; 051-200-045-837-899; 053-314-704-278-647; 054-766-321-214-033; 064-057-346-269-736; 066-008-497-105-394; 086-496-072-727-834; 088-403-918-112-831; 088-526-158-902-16X; 089-014-613-743-963; 102-050-942-042-17X; 102-307-069-255-349; 104-230-077-662-702; 107-710-030-914-986; 109-229-501-697-853; 129-238-238-917-395; 138-573-715-682-221; 141-733-985-572-012; 142-124-709-800-413; 143-853-732-219-682; 146-606-352-041-123; 146-642-617-499-294; 155-062-773-654-255; 159-677-162-555-692; 161-311-885-125-659; 166-738-490-397-857; 168-311-446-296-776; 170-806-540-782-080; 177-329-863-298-205; 180-334-574-388-321; 184-569-449-738-03X,52

Estas zonas son eficaces para detener los plaguicidas transportados en las escorrentias pero no hay mucha informacion sobre el devenir de las moleculas interceptadas. En este trabajo se evaluo la degradacion de un herbicida, el isoproturon (IPU) [3-(4-isopropilfenil)-1, 1-dimetilurea], en suelos provenientes de barreras de hierba, zonas arboladas y parcelas de cultivo del sitio experimental de ARVALIS en la Jailliere, Francia. Los experimentos de degradacion se realizaron en laboratorio utilizando el isoproturon marcado con 14 C en el anillo bencenico. La mineralizacion del IPU fue especialmente importante en los horizontes superficiales de los suelos de las barreras de hierba y la zona arbolada. La formacion de residuos no extraibles es decir, poco disponibles, fue particularmente importante en los horizontes donde la degradacion es mas activa. Asi, la estabilizacion de los residuos de isoproturon es maxima en los horizontes superficiales de los dispositivos amortiguadores. La disipacion rapida del IPU en los suelos de las zonas amortiguadoras indica una funcion de descontaminacion interesante en comparacion con un suelo agricola, ya que la degradacion y la mineralizacion del IPU aumentan. Sin embargo, el debil potencial de degradacion de los horizontes 30-60 cm indica que la eficacia de estos sistemas via procesos de degradacion y estabilizacion de los productos interesados, es mucho mas importante en los horizontes superficiales de suelo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2149505930,,0,005-046-617-641-306; 010-752-756-510-532; 016-632-843-914-561; 045-482-819-833-05X; 050-224-556-170-301; 050-427-573-326-46X; 051-811-471-973-183; 070-471-306-881-913; 075-305-001-764-52X; 077-555-472-027-256; 084-948-181-089-407; 175-841-163-838-32X; 192-576-617-652-629,0

Fitzgibbon,"1. The results of this study, which surveyed 38 farm woods ranging in size from 0.05 to 4.45 ha, demonstrated clearly that the dynamics of wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus and bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus populations in small woods are strongly influenced by the landscape around the woods, for example the distance to neighbouring woods, abundance of hedges and types of crops grown, as well as the habitat within the wood. 2. In terms of the habitat features of the woods, the maturity of the wood and the amount of understorey and overstorey cover were important for both species, while the availability of herbaceous plants influenced bank vole abundance. 3. Wood mice, in particular, were influenced by the types of crops grown in neighbouring fields. Their abundance in spring, the proportion of juveniles in the autumn and the extent to which the population increased from spring to autumn were all influenced by the proportion of adjoining fields that were planted with wheat and/or oilseed rape. 4. Isolation variables, such as the distance to the nearest large wood and the extent of adjoining hedgerows, influenced both wood mice and bank vole populations. Populations of both species increased more from spring to autumn in more isolated woods. This was probably because of reduced opportunities for dispersal and the shortage of alternative woodland habitat for animals moving off the fields after harvest. Woods well connected with hedges supported higher densities of both wood mice and bank voles. 5. Within the size range of woods examined here, no effect of woodland size was found on the probability of catching wood mice or bank voles or their abundance in either spring or autumn. The data suggest that even very small farm woods are important as refuges for small mammals, particularly after harvest when arable fields provide little cover.",34,2,530,539,Understory; Habitat; Ecology; Plant cover; Woodland; Bank vole; Population; Biological dispersal; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/2404895.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2404895,,10.2307/2404895,1963743901,,0,012-338-039-886-640; 021-580-491-011-439; 027-660-266-450-644; 045-365-145-998-68X; 047-034-263-626-912; 050-224-806-567-10X; 055-107-013-670-19X; 065-599-764-597-858; 069-709-387-112-148; 074-911-371-048-145; 088-531-905-159-215; 093-431-505-168-457; 099-491-868-961-481; 100-842-204-936-457; 102-472-184-629-165; 116-368-033-708-622; 140-006-834-045-488; 164-187-601-168-344; 167-682-817-304-816; 170-700-243-832-373; 189-728-047-038-708,152

Isenhart; Timothy B. Parkin; Richard C. Schultz; T.E. Loynachan,"Abstract. Transport and fate of dissolved nitrous oxide (N2O) in groundwater and its significance to nitrogen dynamics within agro-ecosystems are poorly known in spite of significant potential of N2O to global warming and ozone depletion. Increasing denitrification in riparian buffers may trade a reduction in nitrate (NO3−) transport to surface waters for increased N2O emissions resulting from denitrification-produced N2O dissolved in groundwater being emitted into the air when groundwater flows into a stream or a river. This study quantifies the transport and fate of NO3− and dissolved N2O moving from crop fields through riparian buffers, assesses whether groundwater exported from crop fields and riparian buffers is a significant source of dissolved N2O emissions, and evaluates the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology to estimate dissolved N2O emission. We measured concentrations of NO3−; chloride (Cl−); pH; dissolved N2O, dissolved oxygen (DO), and organic carbon (DOC) in groundwater under a multi-species riparian buffer, a cool-season grass filter, and adjacent crop fields located in the Bear Creek watershed in central Iowa, USA. In both the multi-species riparian buffer and the cool-season grass filter, concentrations of dissolved N2O in the groundwater did not change as it passed through the sites, even when the concentrations of groundwater NO3− were decreased by 50% and 59%, respectively, over the same periods. The fraction of N lost to leaching and runoff (0.05) and the modified N2O emission factor, [ratio of dissolved N2O flux to N input (0.00002)] determined for the cropped fields indicate that the current IPCC methodology overestimates dissolved N2O flux in the sites. A low ratio between dissolved N2O flux and soil N2O emission (0.0003) was estimated in the cropped fields. These results suggest that the riparian buffers established adjacent to crop fields for water quality functions (enhanced denitrification) decreased NO3− and were not a source of dissolved N2O. Also, the flux of dissolved N2O from the cropped field was negligible in comparison to soil N2O emission in the crop fields.",6,1,651,685,Riparian zone; Leaching (agriculture); Nitrate; Riparian buffer; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Denitrification; Groundwater,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009BGD.....6..651K/abstract https://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/bgd-2008-0152/ https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/bgd-2008-0152/ https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/6/651/2009/bgd-6-651-2009.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bgd-6-651-2009,,10.5194/bgd-6-651-2009,1970256697,,0,000-600-406-746-566; 002-465-212-013-00X; 002-937-270-631-538; 005-515-575-341-821; 006-017-352-131-346; 006-114-105-725-512; 007-647-947-577-550; 008-377-081-270-046; 009-076-442-788-383; 015-808-269-554-951; 023-617-712-421-298; 025-154-978-814-00X; 025-644-036-005-817; 027-089-714-082-495; 028-802-252-344-012; 031-641-525-938-443; 036-261-768-137-525; 036-902-840-704-756; 047-804-509-542-726; 062-993-300-408-170; 073-703-019-282-474; 075-015-864-957-620; 075-163-057-989-41X; 075-221-116-412-710; 075-429-883-991-330; 079-196-971-304-319; 082-848-132-695-426; 084-823-042-298-058; 084-919-860-583-172; 085-673-191-155-11X; 088-175-727-127-094; 088-995-521-628-487; 094-220-383-468-828; 096-493-700-003-52X; 103-112-301-998-208; 103-141-730-898-275; 105-027-928-982-484; 106-735-246-652-211; 111-293-161-251-748; 112-714-635-134-623; 113-020-912-348-890; 121-468-243-703-60X; 129-149-313-308-705; 133-007-756-045-351; 133-674-479-125-669; 146-775-070-611-770; 157-539-004-512-082; 158-189-041-348-639; 159-142-227-535-211; 164-321-687-092-049; 166-519-155-744-540; 166-711-528-008-07X; 168-744-837-424-994; 170-939-487-720-479; 176-125-284-590-980; 176-658-844-592-805; 187-367-993-326-489,22

Tests of pitfall trap sampling in outdoor arenas showed that G. pennsylvanicus is susceptible to this sampling technique. Pitfall traps were subsequently used to monitor activity-density of G. pennsylvanicus in a soybean ( Glycine max L. Merr.) field and 2 adjacent perennial filter strips, one composed of switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum L.) and the other an alfalfa ( Medicago sativa L.) and timothy grass ( Pheum pratense L.) mixture. G. pennsylvanicus individuals were first captured in early August, peaked in mid-September, and decreased in October.

(Carabidae, Coleoptera) was compared between a strip-managed area (cereal area subdivided by strips of weeds and wild flowering herbs) and a conventionally treated cereal area. Data on phenology, biometry, quantity of the gut content and egg production were collected during the main reproduction period (April-July). Females were found to be significantly larger and heavier in the strip-managed area than in the control area. The higher weight (corrected for size) indicated better feeding conditions in the strip-managed area, which was confirmed by having better filled crops. The state of egg development and the numbers of eggs in the ovaries indicated a prolongation of the reproduction period in the strip-managed area, whereas females caught in the cereal area contained significantly fewer ripe eggs. The results of egg-laying tests in the laboratory showed the same trend but did not confirm any significant differences because of a high rate of individual variation. All measurements from females point to a higher availability of food in the strip-managed area and to an enhanced reproductive potential at this site. For males, on the other hand, the results did not reveal such a uniform trend.",71,2,111,120,Animal science; Control area; PEST analysis; Poecilus cupreus; Poaceae; Phenology; Sex ratio; Reproduction; Botany; Avian clutch size; Biology,,,,,https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND44563093 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1994.tb01777.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1994.tb01777.x,,10.1111/j.1570-7458.1994.tb01777.x,2079656892,,0,001-088-667-324-317; 010-945-646-716-071; 011-257-824-696-294; 013-108-235-924-512; 017-142-360-466-615; 020-837-897-719-052; 021-239-653-544-045; 022-070-333-305-083; 037-241-390-682-529; 043-567-857-099-378; 053-343-090-208-443; 072-817-046-222-302; 087-186-786-234-321; 099-688-156-404-854; 099-723-611-060-346; 101-777-378-567-805; 104-994-312-413-344; 123-421-331-693-40X; 133-540-484-254-808; 158-944-244-258-090,72

The study was carried out in 1998-2006 and covered four shelterbelts (planted in 1993-1996) located in the area of the Dezydery Chlapowski Landscape Park (western part of Poland). The shelterbelts were colonized by macrofungi just after planting. During first years of their growth a total of 174 species were recorded. Species composition changed significantly between ini- tial (1998-2000) and final (2004-2006) period of study. Similarity of macrofungi communi- ties (expressed as the Sorensen's index) between these two periods in studied shelterbelts ranged between 37 and 46%. In spite of high similarity in tree species composition between studied af- forestations (69-80%), the communities of mac- rofungi differed strongly between these sam- pling plots (Sorensen's index was equal to about 40%). Pattern of changes in percentage share of functional groups, i.e. parasitic, mycorrhizal and saprotrophs (humicolous, lignicolous, litter- inhibiting and muscicolous ones) in individual afforestations was different but the diversity of the communities measured with the Shannon- Weaver H' index on the basis of share of func- tional groups tended to increase with ageing of afforestations. On average, the share of fungi growing on soil (ectomycorrhizal and humico- lous saprotrophic species) was highest among all distinguished groups. Species composition of particular functional group was changing dur- ing the study period. A species representing new groups (lignicolous saprotrophs and parasites) were appearing in some shelterbelts in successive years. There were recorded some species rare in Poland, eg.

Westbury; Ben A. Woodcock; S. J. Harris; Valerie K. Brown; Simon G. Potts,"Buffer strips are refuges for a variety of plants providing resources, such as pollen, nectar and seeds, for higher trophic levels, including invertebrates, mammals and birds. Margins can also harbour plant species that are potentially injurious to the adjacent arable crop (undesirable species). Sowing perennial species in non-cropped buffer strips can reduce weed incidence, but limits the abundance of annuals with the potential to support wider biodiversity (desirable species). We investigated the responses of unsown plant species present in buffer strips established with three different seed mixes managed annually with three contrasting management regimes (cutting, sward scarification and selective graminicide). Sward scarification had the strongest influence on the unsown desirable (e.g. Sonchus spp.) and unsown pernicious (e.g. Elytrigia repens) species, and was generally associated with higher cover values of these species. However, abundances of several desirable weed species, in particular Poa annua, were not promoted by scarification. The treatments of cutting and graminicide tended to have negative impacts on the unsown species, except for Cirsium vulgare, which increased with graminicide application. Differences in unsown species cover between seed mixes were minimal, although the grass-only mix was more susceptible to establishment by C. vulgare and Galium aparine than the two grass and forb mixes. Annual scarification can enable desirable annuals and sown perennials to co-exist, however, this practice can also promote pernicious species, and so is unlikely to be widely adopted as a management tool in its current form.",48,2,113,123,Biodiversity; Perennial plant; Weed; Scarification; Galium; Poa annua; Buffer strip; Agronomy; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,http://eprints.worc.ac.uk/1344/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2007.00614.x http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/9373/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2007.00614.x,,10.1111/j.1365-3180.2007.00614.x,1979072390,,0,000-669-594-539-024; 003-525-601-982-136; 010-023-731-010-670; 010-325-997-309-649; 012-335-108-074-344; 015-072-120-385-142; 016-274-966-397-819; 017-032-049-057-221; 021-141-025-755-460; 025-983-895-963-761; 030-055-458-244-653; 032-390-963-080-355; 047-946-954-821-823; 056-789-845-462-569; 062-775-282-343-602; 070-239-213-610-528; 072-897-670-421-690; 073-021-383-708-605; 105-334-971-821-774; 117-345-687-903-78X; 126-015-493-627-611; 133-048-738-071-733; 138-023-694-396-026; 158-091-006-361-365; 159-865-066-848-207; 185-519-157-571-208; 188-597-703-306-560,21

Hughes-Clarke; C.F. Mason,"Abstract The ecological development of field corner plantations on arable land in northwest Essex, UK, was studied. Forty plantations, aged between 1 and 15 years, were examined for soil nutrients, ground flora development, tree survival and natural tree regeneration. Plantation soils showed an overall increase in acidity, total nitrogen and total organic carbon compared with adjacent fields, but there was no difference in total phosphorus or potassium. Total nitrogen and organic carbon increased with age of plantation. The overall ground flora consisted of 182 species, but many occured in only a few plantations. The majority of species were competitors and ruderals. The total number of species, and the number of grassland and woodland species, increased with plantation area. Only arable weed species number was related to plantation age (negatively). Canopy closure markedly reduced the number of species in plantations. The presence of good quality hedgerows adjacent to plantations increased their species richness, especially of shade-tolerant herbs. Planted tree survival in individual plantations ranged from 32 to 98% but was generally good (mean 76%). Most losses occured in the first 9 years and were associated with competition with grasses or with adjacent hedgerows. The density of naturally sown seedlings ranged from 0 to 5667 (mean 360) ha -1 . There was a correlation between age and the number of suckers, but not seedlings. More seedlings and suckers were found in plantations adjacent to good quality hedgerows.",22,1,59,72,Canopy; Ruderal species; Woodland; Weed; Soil fertility; Species richness; Agroforestry; Afforestation; Agronomy; Arable land; Biology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016920469290008N,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0169-2046(92)90008-n,,10.1016/0169-2046(92)90008-n,2031354239,,0,025-747-408-825-376; 030-702-410-083-844; 033-892-035-249-660; 034-722-249-124-331; 034-915-570-700-260; 035-393-856-428-697; 045-306-449-177-784; 049-789-449-714-927; 050-062-472-854-58X; 051-196-788-456-65X; 052-025-744-277-895; 064-516-122-741-835; 067-939-380-433-601; 077-182-319-223-075; 079-343-469-733-772; 082-430-628-262-853; 084-322-638-645-801; 096-660-153-289-666; 098-520-454-909-513; 115-742-892-181-305; 120-438-007-613-043; 137-360-755-261-936; 166-542-102-822-213,3

Feber; Rebecca L. Dulieu; Martin C. Townsend; Mark S. Parsons; Nigel A.D. Bourn; Philip Riordan; David W. Macdonald,"Agri-environment schemes (AES) are widely used policy instruments intended to combat widespread biodiversity declines across agricultural landscapes. Here, using a light trapping and mark-release-recapture study at a field-scale on nine common and widespread larger moth species, we investigate the effect of wide field margins (a popular current scheme option) and the presence of hedgerow trees (a potential scheme option in England) on moth abundance. Of these, we show that wide field margins positively affected abundances, although species did not all respond in the same way. We demonstrate that this variation can be attributed to species-specific mobility characteristics. Those species for which the effect of wide margins was strongest covered shorter distances, and were more frequently recaptured at their site of first capture. This demonstrates that the standard, field-scale uptake of AES may be effective only for less mobile species. We discuss that a landscape-scale approach, in contrast, could deliver significant biodiversity gains, as our results indicate that such an approach (perhaps delivered through targeting farmers to join AES) would be effective for the majority of wider countryside species, irrespective of their mobility level. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Haycock; Gilles Pinay,"Nitate retention in riparian buffer strips is well documented in summer periods, but the potential of winter retention within these zones is poorly documented. Two sites, grass (L.), and poplar ()-vegetated riparian strips, were investigated in southern England (River Leach). Groundwater flow was via subsurface pathways within the sites, NO concentration gradients and loading rates were calculated over the winter period. Nitrate retention was found to be linearly dependent on load rate. Nitrate retention occurred at the edge of the riparian zone. This was most obvious in the poplar site where all hillslope-derived NO was absorbed within the first 5 m of flow within the riparian strip. When loading rates into the sites increased, NO absorption migrated upslope from the riparian site. The poplar-vegetated riparian zone was found to be more resilient (99% retention of NO) than the grass-vegetated riparian zone (84% retention of NO) in the winter months. It is postulated that although vegetation has no active role in retaining NO in the winter, above-ground vegetative biomass does contribute C to the soil microbacterial biomass that is engaged in NO reduction in the winter months, this accounted for the greater efficiency of the poplar vegetated site.",22,2,273,278,Biomass (ecology); Riparian zone; Groundwater flow; Nitrate; Riparian buffer; Hydrology; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Groundwater; Water pollution,,,,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/1408530 https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/22/2/JEQ0220020273 https://www.agronomy.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/22/2/JEQ0220020273 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq1993.00472425002200020007x,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1993.00472425002200020007x,,10.2134/jeq1993.00472425002200020007x,2066620448,,0,053-093-567-362-36X; 104-993-597-055-071; 113-241-171-872-810,365

McDowell; D. R. Stevens; V. Cave; R. J. Paton; M. Johnson,"Sustainable land use for deer farming requires the maintenance of good soil and water quality, which can be adversely affected by fence-line pacing. This study tested the hypothesis that the absence or presence of shelter belts (one or two) in paddocks decreases fence-line pacing and associated soil and water quality impacts. Soils near the fence line and in the rest of the paddock, in paddocks containing zero, one or two shelter belts, were sampled for bulk density and macroporosity (pores > 30 μm diameter). Large intact samples (1 x 0.2 x 0.1 m 3 ) were used to generate overland flow via rainfall simulation. The flow was tested for nutrients [phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) fractions], suspended sediment (SS), and the faecal indicator bacteria, Escherichia coli. Results showed that bulk density, void volume, SS, particulate P and total P were affected by location (fence line or rest of paddock) but, along with all other measurements except E. coli, were not affected by the number of shelter belts. Thus, the inclusion of shelter had no effect on the concentration of contaminant lost in overland flow or any soil physical or hydrological parameter, but decreased the run-off of E. coli. The lack of contrast between the location of soils can be partly attributed to the soil type (Brown, NZ soil classification, USDA Taxonomy: Typic Fragiudalf), which when compared with past studies was less erosive and lost less P into solution. Other factors may have been different management or the lesser impact of weaners compared with older hinds and stags on soil properties. Although only E. coli concentrations were decreased by the inclusion of shelter, factors such as improved production and animal welfare weigh heavily in favour of installing and maintaining shelter on deer farms. However, the environmental benefit of shelter should be tested in other farms where factors such as slope, soil, climate and farm management may increase the contrast with no shelter.",22,2,158,164,Animal science; Windbreak; Soil classification; Soil water; Soil type; Ecology; Soil quality; Alfisol; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Bulk density,,,,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/569400 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-2743.2006.00024.x https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-2743.2006.00024.x/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-2743.2006.00024.x,,10.1111/j.1475-2743.2006.00024.x,2007707742,,0,014-173-821-348-586; 027-428-678-656-001; 042-735-116-293-521; 044-518-557-855-309; 045-078-955-848-577; 045-569-693-735-631; 047-858-222-781-90X; 067-987-736-159-516; 073-469-559-756-017; 078-769-161-337-046; 082-183-287-581-091; 104-713-501-432-540; 110-261-673-897-11X; 119-838-630-399-357; 122-009-551-258-951; 134-740-517-631-482; 164-716-977-397-621; 169-607-559-923-667; 176-876-618-567-21X,10

Visser,"Field margins can attract and conserve predators and parasitoids, and may thus contribute to pest suppression. On 20 hectares of organic farming, a network of field margins has been laid down to investigate three main questions: 1. Does an increased biodiversity in a farming system contribute to the suppression of pest populations? 2. How far can field margins be apart? 3. What vegetation diversity is required in order to achieve pest populations suppression? Pitfall traps and yellow water pans in field margins and crops are used to assess antagonists’ densities. Samples of key pests and damage assessments in different crops are related to the distance from the nearest margins. The first results out of these massive data sets are presented. In both wheat and potato, aphid incidence appeared unrelated to the distance from the nearest crop edge. However, aphid densities were much lower in the BIOdivers subsystem with field margins compared to the control system. A similar pattern was observed for carrot fly (Psila rosae; Diptera, Psilidae) damage in carrots. This reoccurring pattern suggests that in the field margin network of the BIOdivers system, the total assemblage of (generalists and specialists) predators and parasitoids exert a degree of pest suppression in several crops, over distances of at least 50 m.",26,4,185,190,Agriculture; Organic farming; Biodiversity; PEST analysis; Carrot fly; Psilidae; Generalist and specialist species; Agroforestry; Agronomy; Arable land; Biology,,,,,http://edepot.wur.nl/116057 http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/377035,http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/377035,,,2146661787,,0,000-842-510-082-511; 004-631-687-355-138; 010-889-529-501-772; 017-387-379-838-621; 032-807-383-394-447; 048-302-416-952-052; 053-802-411-749-989; 056-585-869-238-25X; 056-789-845-462-569; 063-058-499-693-907; 087-186-786-234-321; 089-425-631-846-161; 111-528-391-156-029; 131-536-266-143-072; 150-104-334-894-282,5

Pfiffner; H. Luka; C. Schlatter; A. Juen; M. Traugott,"In a 2-year experiment we investigated whether wildflower strips can be used to enhance the control of cabbage moth, Mamestra brassicae L., and cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae L. At two sites, including six organically cultivated fields, M. brassicae egg parasitism and predation rates were determined along with an assessment of larval parasitism rates in M. brassicae and P. rapae using a DNA-based approach. Within each field, plots with and without wildflower strips were sampled and a grid design of 3 m x   3 m was used to analyse the spatial pattern of parasitism. The provision of wildflower strips provided an idiosyncratic effect on the control of lepidopterans: parasitism rates in M. brassicae eggs and larvae were not affected, whereas parasitism rates of larval P. rapae were significantly enhanced by the wildflower strips at one of the two sites. Moreover, at one site predation rates on M. brassicae eggs were significantly enhanced in the wildflower strip plots. Geostatistical analysis showed no distinct spatial patterns in parasitism rates. These results demonstrate that the provision of wildflower strips does not necessarily enhance biological control of lepidopteran cabbage pests and suggest that site-specific environmental factors strongly affect the impact of wildflower strips.; ; (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V",129,1-3,310,314,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2008.10.003,,10.1016/j.agee.2008.10.003,,,0,036-768-785-396-134; 044-405-697-969-681; 049-461-410-363-614; 056-892-630-404-500; 057-444-567-981-862; 057-566-599-669-764; 062-036-445-726-722; 066-099-723-829-435; 066-839-397-580-750; 073-900-849-653-951; 076-184-858-330-470; 076-349-963-255-639; 077-500-736-604-347; 096-356-202-982-680; 102-726-931-556-404; 122-528-143-728-138; 194-595-863-937-394,45

Line; William A. Harman; Gregory D. Jennings; E. J. Thompson; Deanna L. Osmond,"Cattle (Bos taurus) grazing on unimproved pastures can be a significant, yet often overlooked, source of pollutants to surface waters, especially when the cattle have unlimited access to streams in the pastures. Livestock exclusion from streams has been demonstrated to reduce sediment and possibly nutrient yield from streams draining pastures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of excluding dairy cows from, and planting trees in, a 335-m-long and 10- to 16-m- wide riparian corridor along a small North Carolina stream. Analysis of 81 wk of pre-exclusion and 137 wk of post-exclusion fencing data documented 33, 78, 76, and 82% reductions in weekly nitrate + nitrite, total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus (TP), and sediment loads, respectively, from the 14.9-ha pasture area adjacent to the fenced section of stream. Statistical analyses by t-tests and analysis of variance suggested that the reductions in mean weekly loads post-fencing were significant (P < 0.05) for all pollutants except nitrate + nitrite. Thus, the results indicated that livestock exclusion and subsequent riparian vegetation establishment was effective at reducing pollutant export from an intensively grazed pasture.",29,6,1882,1890,Livestock; Riparian zone; Animal science; Nonpoint source pollution; Eutrophication; Nitrate; Grazing; Pasture; Hydrology; Environmental science; Pollutant,,,,,https://www.agronomy.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/29/6/JEQ0290061882 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20003034952 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/1408440 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2000.00472425002900060022x,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2000.00472425002900060022x,,10.2134/jeq2000.00472425002900060022x,2006497291,,0,,102

In this four-year field experiment, conducted on six field parcels, the ability of wildflower strips to simultaneously promote the availability of pollination services (using bumblebee abundance as a proxy), species diversity (total species richness of bumblebees, butterflies and diurnal moths) and conservation (abundance of habitat specialist butterflies) was evaluated. The results showed that the first two indicators increased strongly and rapidly in wildflower strips until the third year of the experiment. The conservation indicator increased more slowly and this response was related to the forest cover of the surrounding landscape. Furthermore, the benefits of wildflower strips were largely independent of experimentally varied strip properties. It is concluded that wildflower strips are a flexible mitigation tool to promote different biodiversity targets in agricultural systems. Pollination services and species diversity can be promoted in different kinds of landscapes by ensuring local habitat quality.

Cut strips contained more species than the grass crop but most were generalists or woody species.

Extensively managed field margins can help protect this functional biodiversity by providing habitat for beneficial species.; ; 2. This 2 year study investigated the relative benefits of grassland field margin treatments (Fenced only, Rotavated, and Reseeded (with a grass and wildflower mixture)) on the abundance and taxon richness of five arthropod trophic groups (detritivores, herbivores, predators, parasitoids and hyperparasitoids) from the orders Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera and Araneae.; ; 3. The taxon richness and abundance of all trophic groups (with the exception of herbivore abundance) was greater in fenced field margin treatments than in the adjacent grazed field, particularly by the final sampling occasion. However, there were seasonal differences, with abundance and taxon richness generally greater in August than in June. Only detritivores and herbivores responded to the individual fenced field margin treatments.

R. Meek; Richard F. Pywell; Marek Nowakowski,"The value of introduced seed mixtures in providing forage for bumblebees on farmland was assessed by direct observation of individuals and analysis of pollen loads. Two mixtures of perennial grasses and wildflowers were compared with an annual mix of mostly seed-bearing crops over three years. Foraging bees showed contrasting patterns of visitation depending on species. Longer-tongued Bombus species preferred the perennial mixtures in which Trifolium pratense was dominant, whilst shorter-tongued Bombus and honeybees, Apis mellifera, visited mainly Borago officinalis in the annual mix. These patterns were supported by analysis of pollen loads from B. pascuorum and B. terrestris, both species showing a high degree of flower constancy to sown species. The relative specialisation of different bee species towards certain plant families, and the flowering phenology of seed mix components, must be considered in the design of agri-environment measures to conserve these and other pollinators.",37,3,326,340,Pollinator; Forage (honey bee); Perennial plant; Apidae; Apoidea; Flower constancy; Pollen; Phenology; Botany; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://paperity.org/p/141988198/assessing-the-value-of-annual-and-perennial-forage-mixtures-for-bumblebees-by-direct https://www.apidologie.org/articles/apido/pdf/2006/03/M6013.pdf http://www.wildbienen.info/downloads/Carvell_Westrich_etal_69.pdf https://dx.doi.org/10.1051/apido:2006002 https://www.edpsciences.org/10.1051/apido:2006002 https://www.wildbienen.info/downloads/Carvell_Westrich_etal_69.pdf https://www.apidologie.org/articles/apido/abs/2006/03/M6013/M6013.html http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/apido:2006002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/apido:2006002,,10.1051/apido:2006002,2130572587,,0,000-925-852-080-712; 012-110-995-744-916; 018-442-796-237-224; 024-807-276-093-542; 032-474-236-800-115; 035-775-229-294-961; 035-993-763-187-90X; 038-844-627-956-858; 043-370-795-714-558; 046-004-550-166-441; 048-543-721-099-075; 052-529-066-839-105; 056-585-869-238-25X; 056-789-845-462-569; 057-951-815-743-465; 077-623-747-437-53X; 079-492-501-193-26X; 083-810-224-480-214; 105-466-690-006-049; 108-814-507-291-345; 109-473-377-783-758; 110-126-189-999-315; 111-322-987-986-847; 112-917-317-852-89X; 114-016-061-618-278; 114-480-653-531-829; 114-859-376-855-871; 117-345-687-903-78X; 135-693-891-885-623; 168-312-770-361-773; 191-773-521-506-797,81

O'Geen; Louise E. Jackson,"The aim of this paper was to assess biodiversity among different habitats of an organic farm and the relationships between some soil properties, nematode taxonomic diversity, and soil food web condition. Eight habitats were studied in the farm: ponds, ditches, a riparian corridor, hedgerows, and four agricultural fields (mustard, oats, fallow, and legumes). The undisturbed riparian corridor had higher soil $${\text{NO}}_{\text{3}}^ - - {\text{N}}$$;  and $${\text{NH}}_4^ + - {\text{N}}$$;  concentrations, and potentially mineralizable N and higher abundances of bacterivore nematodes and longer food webs. Canonical correlation analysis showed associations between habitats and nematode trophic groups: predatory and bacterial-feeding nematodes in the riparian corridor and hedgerows, omnivore nematodes in the ponds and ditches, and fungal-feeding nematodes in the legume field. Soil chemical and physical properties mirrored the aboveground farm patterns and were more similar among habitats that were or had been cultivated, compared to the riparian corridor. Soil food web indices, based on functional analysis of nematode faunal composition, reflected the aboveground landscape heterogeneity. Discriminant analysis indicated that soil food web indices separated the two most disturbed habitats (ponds and tailwater ditches) from the two least disturbed habitats (the riparian corridor and hedgerows). The indices correlated with soil functioning as inferred by soil properties. Abundance of nematode taxa was not associated with aboveground landscape patterns. The complexity of the soil food web may have been influenced by (1) environmental factors that differed between years, (2) different time periods since disturbance in the various habitats, and (3) movement of nutrients and organisms by water flow between habitats in the farmscale.",44,5,727,744,Food web; Riparian zone; Organic farming; Biodiversity; Habitat; Ecology; Water flow; Soil food web; Agronomy; Trophic level; Biology,,,,,https://ucanr.edu/sites/Jackson_Lab/files/113600.pdf https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00374-007-0256-0.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00374-007-0256-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-007-0256-0,,10.1007/s00374-007-0256-0,2055231994,,0,000-689-702-074-331; 003-907-525-480-153; 004-167-559-659-819; 004-492-015-427-63X; 004-635-157-368-378; 006-807-920-329-120; 007-541-372-936-050; 009-436-348-069-514; 009-508-051-127-330; 010-423-042-177-734; 013-291-095-460-522; 015-511-375-964-914; 016-459-795-797-842; 017-506-139-680-393; 017-555-940-460-67X; 026-745-298-292-35X; 027-994-526-345-075; 030-742-593-017-992; 030-978-497-436-303; 031-357-096-031-895; 031-516-924-806-664; 032-807-208-218-884; 035-519-172-134-12X; 037-655-209-344-331; 042-714-677-464-308; 044-338-882-212-755; 044-849-348-883-406; 044-914-564-605-687; 048-051-535-661-406; 050-357-955-949-469; 053-295-226-109-871; 057-720-330-037-206; 058-741-260-042-526; 065-755-128-983-805; 065-819-125-643-354; 067-412-268-380-895; 068-567-042-775-977; 077-899-911-729-09X; 081-640-666-093-914; 084-406-478-777-589; 089-574-681-563-601; 096-960-066-363-762; 097-779-488-783-943; 099-476-479-226-55X; 100-693-323-671-723; 101-934-986-069-937; 104-402-912-397-497; 104-993-739-215-561; 106-444-334-231-337; 109-558-923-762-907; 113-070-276-598-586; 116-049-798-691-473; 118-136-058-560-88X; 120-055-510-842-160; 125-952-059-804-814; 130-428-793-212-186; 138-075-475-467-298; 141-506-598-390-294; 144-039-355-460-541; 162-991-788-256-196; 195-300-106-988-149; 196-937-470-206-70X,42

Bruneteau; M. Vandier,"Grasshoppers are important components of grassland invertebrate communities, particularly as nutrient recyclers and as prey for many bird species. Sown margin strips are key features of agri-environmental schemes in European agricultural landscapes and have been shown to benefit grasshoppers depending on the initial sown seed mixture. Understanding the mechanisms by which the sown mixture impacts grasshoppers in sown margin strips is the aim of our study. Here, we investigated plant–grasshopper interactions in sown margin strips and the respective effects of plant identity and diversity on grasshoppers. We surveyed plants and grasshoppers in 44 sown margin strips located in Western France which were initially established with three sowing mixtures dominated, respectively, by alfalfa, Festuca rubra and Lolium perenne and Festuca arundinacea. Grasshopper species contrasted in their response to plant diversity and to the abundance of sown and non-sown plant species. Some grasshopper species were positively correlated with the abundance of grass and especially of a single sown plant species, F. rubra. In contrast, other grasshopper species benefited from high plant diversity likely due to their high degree of polyphagy. At the community level, these contrasted responses were translated into a positive linear relationship between grass cover and grasshopper abundance and into a quadratic relationship between plant diversity and grasshopper diversity or abundance. Since plant identity and diversity are driven by the initial sown mixture, our study suggests that by optimizing the seed mixture, it is possible to manage grasshopper diversity or abundance in sown margin strips.",9,4,333,346,Biodiversity; Ecology; Grassland; Acrididae; Festuca arundinacea; Lolium perenne; Grasshopper; Festuca rubra; Agronomy; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11829-015-9376-x https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11829-015-9376-x/fulltext.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11829-015-9376-x,,10.1007/s11829-015-9376-x,875821582,,0,001-303-826-546-224; 003-251-732-418-644; 004-294-175-783-070; 004-323-714-050-192; 005-758-142-536-451; 011-208-771-211-976; 013-946-487-834-874; 019-125-680-130-721; 023-935-502-746-047; 025-983-895-963-761; 034-918-544-940-977; 038-488-515-100-715; 039-630-411-737-27X; 040-090-028-684-735; 040-253-713-116-916; 040-350-584-504-238; 040-698-890-228-953; 045-445-063-674-649; 046-424-961-144-141; 048-773-876-623-381; 053-710-838-701-96X; 054-715-078-148-813; 056-585-869-238-25X; 058-226-654-592-129; 060-679-385-902-62X; 062-218-780-389-812; 064-524-534-627-895; 074-721-779-957-193; 074-793-529-288-006; 078-293-506-725-212; 078-535-888-367-99X; 081-198-292-463-95X; 083-381-011-024-36X; 088-710-088-449-565; 089-820-647-773-411; 094-127-096-545-935; 097-092-295-500-651; 101-467-474-763-36X; 102-362-526-374-610; 105-065-409-527-284; 105-168-051-489-560; 107-968-640-231-523; 108-970-799-399-706; 126-057-775-278-224; 126-422-348-422-052; 150-325-162-873-23X; 155-691-175-864-748; 195-618-519-387-640,7

Moreover, different ways of mitigating the losses in a boreal climate are discussed. Studies were conducted in 1996-2008 at Jokioinen, Tohmajarvi, Ruukki and Taivalkoski.; ; Water samples representing surface runoff were collected from open ditches and analysed e.g. for total solids (sediment) as well as total P (TP), dissolved reactive P (DRP) and total N (TN) to estimate nutrient losses from forested feedlots with different stocking rates (animal units per hectare, AU/ha) and from slurry-amended grass. Surface runoff samples were similarly analysed to evaluate the efficacy of 10 m wide buffer zones to decrease and retain nutrient losses from pasture and tilled soil. The soil was sampled for plant-available P and mineral nitrogen (SMN) analyses.; ; Fairly high TP (0,9-1,4 kg/ha/yr) and TN (4-16 kg/ha/yr) losses occurred in ditch water from forested feedlots where cattle has been reared for 1-3 years. These amounts correspond to the annual losses from cropped felds. The plant-available P (up to 20 mg/L) in surface soil and the amount of SMN (up to 100-400 kg/ha) in the 60 cm deep soil layer were highest in places where the cattle gathered, such as bedded and feeding areas (called high-input areas).; ; High losses of TP and DRP (4,4 and 3,6 kg/ha/yr, respectively) also occured in surface runoff from the grass fields where surface application of slurry (40 t/ha) in autumn was followed by rainfall. Injection of the slurry into the soil decreased TP and DRP losses by 79 and 86 %, respectively.; ; The buffer zones along watercourses were less important in the grazed field than in autumn-tilled soil due to the smaller erosion and nutrient losses from grass than from tilled soil. The surface runoff losses of sediment, TP and TN decreased by more than 50, 30 and 50 %, respectively, by buffer zones on tilled soil.",,,,,Erosion; Total dissolved solids; Nutrient; Pasture; Ditch; Sediment; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Phosphorus; Agronomy,,,,,http://orgprints.org/16813/1/mtttiede7.pdf https://jukuri.luke.fi/handle/10024/438316 http://www.mtt.fi/mtttiede/pdf/mtttiede7.pdf https://orgprints.org/id/eprint/16813/,https://jukuri.luke.fi/handle/10024/438316,,,26388856,,0,000-320-672-752-794; 000-714-376-181-669; 005-039-941-602-805; 005-155-501-929-87X; 007-241-106-224-54X; 008-948-130-979-390; 009-169-915-488-894; 009-248-758-733-184; 009-806-097-947-292; 011-288-274-938-632; 012-704-803-641-276; 013-425-576-776-57X; 014-251-633-857-00X; 014-561-967-561-763; 015-215-491-508-16X; 017-271-112-600-695; 018-212-847-539-780; 018-668-638-487-019; 018-890-906-176-709; 024-179-289-996-527; 028-025-519-103-100; 030-682-084-703-597; 031-784-027-504-755; 032-352-602-848-253; 034-139-180-623-07X; 034-748-846-517-673; 035-607-343-413-589; 036-889-236-746-729; 038-659-320-814-260; 039-129-331-213-450; 040-470-082-538-290; 043-839-290-390-354; 049-899-708-907-289; 055-494-363-954-590; 058-092-669-418-747; 063-868-086-799-556; 066-160-305-182-384; 069-915-446-537-208; 070-790-840-870-745; 072-307-357-826-584; 074-156-419-052-56X; 076-826-572-086-275; 077-418-118-294-000; 079-264-187-787-54X; 079-537-139-295-920; 082-797-391-654-568; 086-304-856-594-276; 088-236-621-248-724; 089-511-057-268-117; 090-479-400-395-403; 091-602-863-179-667; 102-307-069-255-349; 102-381-504-494-463; 103-750-378-883-448; 104-538-356-167-561; 110-028-002-619-628; 111-229-567-477-96X; 112-062-796-589-388; 112-840-321-256-22X; 114-691-978-054-143; 116-435-053-348-131; 123-999-809-449-467; 128-195-997-346-382; 134-388-309-968-363; 136-078-117-326-445; 138-453-206-836-337; 139-686-152-452-357; 141-241-435-513-682; 141-828-395-465-227; 146-176-027-911-992; 146-325-237-721-229; 147-749-992-097-760; 148-032-072-732-15X; 148-447-693-552-594; 148-468-520-956-729; 153-882-585-520-437; 155-077-672-111-552; 156-559-662-768-946; 157-378-714-184-189; 165-740-369-689-328; 165-894-637-048-634; 167-013-613-510-038; 175-076-714-727-867; 175-427-840-393-978; 176-737-333-058-307; 180-961-259-537-959; 181-236-947-340-767; 183-493-993-121-67X; 187-118-162-708-884; 195-389-162-764-127; 196-199-326-289-983; 198-140-893-377-564; 198-893-447-208-716,3

Pelz-Stelinski; Lukasz L. Stelinski,"Densities of an herbivorous pest may be impacted by landscape and orchard architecture. We present two orchard experiments where the densities of the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri) were compared depending on: (1) the presence or absence of a windbreak and (2) if the orchards consisted of a solid set re-planting or an orchard with a mixture of mature and reset-replacement trees. Psyllid abundance was measured on the edges of five orchards. The factor investigated was the presence or absence of a windbreak. We observed significantly fewer psyllids on the edges of orchards with windbreaks as compared to those without windbreaks. We found no significant difference in the number of natural enemies between the edges with or without windbreaks, suggesting that windbreaks do not affect densities of psyllid natural enemies. Also, during two consecutive years, we compared the densities of psyllids on young trees less than 3 years of age in a solid set re-planting versus on resets (trees planted in replacement of dead or huanglongbing-infected trees) present randomly within mature orchards. This was conducted in four orchards and among three citrus varieties. More psyllids were found in the solid set re-plantings as compared with on the resets within mature orchards. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that the planting strategy of new trees in orchards may impact the populations of a horticultural pest. Overall our data suggest that establishment and conservation of windbreaks might be beneficial to protect orchards from D. citri. The data also suggest that D. citri populations increase more within uniform landscapes of seedling trees as compared with mature orchards with randomly interspersed young seedlings.",212,,168,174,Windbreak; Horticulture; Sowing; PEST analysis; Seedling; Citrus greening disease; Diaphorina citri; Orchard; Herbivore; Botany; Biology,,,,Citrus Research and Development Foundation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880915300104 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5324463 https://www.crec.ifas.ufl.edu/academics/faculty/stelinski/PDF/Martini_et_al._2015_AE_and_E.pdf https://swfrec.ifas.ufl.edu/hlb/database/pdf/4_MartiniAbsence_15.pdf http://www.crec.ifas.ufl.edu/academics/faculty/stelinski/PDF/Martini_et_al._2015_AE_and_E.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2015.06.027,,10.1016/j.agee.2015.06.027,1003137514,,0,000-973-633-837-89X; 005-779-149-485-178; 006-591-418-766-659; 011-508-246-956-659; 015-931-040-555-191; 016-454-986-669-584; 016-748-895-371-225; 022-018-580-915-841; 025-959-213-572-991; 026-405-196-569-505; 027-412-446-850-220; 027-697-425-797-266; 028-825-061-009-23X; 028-898-060-641-089; 032-043-084-866-144; 033-803-046-627-527; 037-666-772-685-569; 037-849-171-581-184; 039-303-755-973-227; 041-404-422-643-021; 049-095-563-996-722; 051-013-011-750-361; 051-300-858-751-249; 057-882-423-695-971; 062-355-614-642-668; 064-281-600-456-024; 065-141-537-032-158; 076-810-017-112-124; 078-686-633-904-421; 080-195-809-555-794; 087-186-042-590-550; 088-426-133-192-335; 093-219-238-348-112; 099-778-734-438-538; 105-341-810-877-174; 111-262-230-568-879; 113-288-520-395-791; 144-981-728-907-338; 156-624-196-949-616; 169-590-311-723-030,18

Freeman; Phil V. Grice; Gavin M. Siriwardena,"Summary; 1. Agri-environment schemes (AES) are used extensively across Europe to address biodiversity declines in farmland. In England, Environmental Stewardship (ES) was introduced in 2005 to address the shortcomings of previous schemes, but as for schemes in other countries, assessments to date have revealed little evidence for national-scale biodiversity benefits.; ; 2. Here, we assess the efficacy of ES in driving changes in national farmland bird populations over the period 2002–2010, using BTO/JNCC/RSPB Breeding Bird Survey data. We tested for associations between ES management options, grouped into categories reflecting intended biological effects (e.g. stubble), and species’ population growth rates, wherever benefits of management might be expected to occur.; ; 3. We found strong evidence for positive effects of management that provides winter food resources (i.e. ES stubble and wild bird seed [WBS] crops) on population growth rates across multiple granivorous species, at three landscape scales. The results for management aiming to provide breeding season benefits (i.e. grassland, field margin and boundary [hedge, ditch] management) showed mixed patterns of positive and negative associations.; ; 4. The results for stubble and WBS provide the first evidence for landscape-scale responses of biodiversity to AES management. The negative relationships identified may also show the importance of management context driving unforeseen predation or competition effects.; ; 5. Synthesis and Applications. This study demonstrates that agri-environment scheme management has the potential to have national-scale effects on avian population growth rates, although our results suggest that some components of the scheme have had little effect on bird populations. Therefore, whilst this study provides the first proof-of-concept for broad-and-shallow scheme impacts on biodiversity, our results underline the importance of targeting towards population-limiting factors, here winter food resources. A combination of low uptake of key in-field options that provide winter seed and a failure to cover the late-winter period effectively explains the lack of national population responses. Such issues need to be addressed before schemes like Environmental Stewardship will achieve their goals. This study shows the value of feedback from monitoring for informing scheme design, through identifying problems and testing solutions.",49,4,871,882,"Environmental resource management; Land use, land-use change and forestry; Biodiversity; Geography; Breeding bird survey; Agricultural policy; Context (language use); Environmental stewardship; Population; Population growth",,,,,https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/landscape-scale-responses-of-birds-to-agri-environment-management https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02161.x https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND44763547 https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02161.x https://core.ac.uk/display/9697057 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02161.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02161.x/abstract https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02161.x%4010.1111/%28ISSN%291365-2664.AGRO_ECOLOGY https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02161.x https://core.ac.uk/download/9697057.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02161.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02161.x,1856883107,,0,002-262-285-007-84X; 007-194-033-627-161; 010-015-870-849-695; 016-421-756-148-512; 021-419-559-384-303; 036-117-863-979-556; 041-304-068-012-631; 042-082-544-198-293; 043-009-269-441-396; 043-583-117-779-984; 051-685-596-945-405; 055-946-607-021-418; 056-099-523-856-735; 057-720-592-467-337; 057-941-074-733-032; 063-149-977-873-288; 064-643-064-473-458; 068-933-205-872-606; 074-225-773-604-407; 075-491-486-540-39X; 076-278-055-254-459; 085-737-772-585-724; 093-313-315-515-73X; 095-859-455-727-31X; 096-101-436-780-075; 103-573-046-017-776; 111-555-145-816-70X; 124-319-214-482-940; 137-723-310-088-608; 173-341-907-639-996,112

Blake; Ben A. Woodcock; Duncan B. Westbury; Peter Sutton; Simon G. Potts,"Grass buffer strips have been widely sown to mitigate against intensive agricultural management practices that have negatively impacted on invertebrate and plant biodiversity in arable farming systems. Typically, such strips are floristically species poor and are dominated by grasses. In the present study, we developed management practices to enhance the floristic and structural diversity of these existing strips for the benefit of spiders, a key provider of natural pest control in crops.; ; ; Across three UK arable farms, we investigated the benefits of: (i) scarification to create germination niches into which wildflower seeds were sown and (ii) the effect of graminicide applications to suppress grass dominance. Spiders were sampled twice per year (July and September) during 2008 and 2009.; ; ; The combination of scarification with wildflower seeds, as well as graminicide, resulted in the greatest wildflower cover and lowest grass cover, with a general trend of increased abundance of adult and juvenile spiders. The abundance of Pachygnatha degeeri, Bathyphantes gracilis and juvenile wolf spiders of the genus Pardosa was positively correlated with wildflower cover, probably reflecting increased prey availability.

160-731-468-790-548,Biodiversity and agro-ecology in field margins.,,2005,journal article,Communications in agricultural and applied biological sciences,13791176,Universiteit Gent,Belgium,B De Cauwer; Dirk Reheul; Ivan Nijs; Ann Milbau,"This multidisciplinary study investigates agro-ecological functions (nature conservation, agriculture, environment) and implications of newly created, mown sown and unsown field margin strips installed on ex-arable land to increase biodiversity. From conservational concern, the development of species rich field margin strips was not strongly affected by the installed type of margin strip since species diversity converged over time, whether strips were sown or not. Convergence between unsown and sown margin strips occurred also in terms of species composition: unsown and sown strips became similar over time. Mowing without removal of cuttings significantly reduced species richness, yielded more grassy margin strips and delayed similarity in species composition between sown and unsown margin strips. Species richness on the longer term was not significantly affected by light regime nor by disturbance despite significant temporary effects shortly after the disturbance event. On the contrary vegetation composition in terms of importance of functional groups changed after disturbance: the share of spontaneous species within functional groups increased resulting in higher similarity between the sown and unsown vegetation. Furthermore risk of invasion was highest in the disturbed unsown community on the unshaded side of a tree lane. A positive effect of botanical diversity on insect number and diversity was found. However the effects of botanical diversity on insect number was mediated by light regime. At high light availability differences between plant communities were more pronounced compared to low light availablilty. The abundance of some insect families was dependent on the vegetation composition. Furthermore light availability significantly influenced insect diversity as well as the spatial distribution of families. From agricultural concern, installing margin strips by sowing a species mixture and a mowing regime with removal of cuttings are good practices to diminish the risk of species ingrowth into adjacent crops by creeping roots and rhizomes. Seed dispersal was only problematic one year after the installation of the field margin strips particularly nearby the unsown margin strip and wind-borne seeds were dispersed over limited distances, mainly within 4 m of field margins. Annual herbage yield was not affected by mowing management. DM yield of sown/unsown communities converged over time. Compared to herbage from an intensively managed fertilized grassland, field margin herbage revealed a low feeding value, owing to a low crude protein content, a low digestibility and a high crude fibre content. The unsown community had a higher forage quality than communities sown to bred commercially available grass varieties. Both digestibility and crude protein content decreased over time irrespective of plant community or location. Mid June cuts were more productive than mid September cuts but digestibility and crude protein content was lower. The use of herbage from field margins as hay for horses or as a component in farmland compost are good alternatives. A strong relation was found between the distribution of pest insects and their antagonist families along field margin strips indicating a status of biological equilibrium. From environmental concern, field margin strips buffered boundary vegetation and watercourses against cropped areas loaded with high levels of mineral nitrogen. Margin strips reduced the mineral nitrogen content of the soil in the margin and mineral nitrogen loss during wintermonths. Mineral nitrogen loss was not affected by field margin type but by distance from the field crop. A minimal width of 5 m is necessary to reach an optimal reduction in mineral soil N and N losses.",70,1,17,49,Biodiversity; Sowing; Vegetation; Seed dispersal; Ecology; Forage; Plant community; Species richness; Species diversity; Biology,,Agriculture; Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources/methods; Ecosystem; Humans; Insecta/growth & development; Poaceae/classification; Population Dynamics; Time Factors,,,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/471523/file/1877317.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16363358/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/16363358 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16363358 https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/471523,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16363358,16363358,,2286827218,,0,,5

Field margins are common linear structures in the agricultural landscape. In the present study, we evaluated the factors that exert an impact on the forage flora composition and on the diversity in field margins. The study was conducted in the 2010 - 2011 time period across the agricultural landscape on the Lublin Upland of SE Poland. Data on the forage flora were obtained while making floristic charts along 45 transect plots x 300 m; the total length being 13500 m. Multivariate ordination techniques (PCA and RDA) were employed to analyse forage-flora characteristics. Field margins represent valuable refuge areas for forage-species richness, but not for the abundance of forage species. On field margins, forage-species diversity benefits from the location of natural habitats (forests or meadows), primarily if the distance from these habitats is &lt;1000 m or the field acreage is &lt;10 ha. The shift from heterogeneous habitats to a more homogeneous landscape causes a reduction of forage floral diversity. Due to lack of dense forage-species patches, the promotion of sowing nectariferous and/or polleniferous species seems to be a reasonable management method to enhance the quantitative food niche on field margins and to support the conservation of pollinators in the areas surrounding farms.</jats:p>",59,1,27,37,Ecological niche; Pollinator; Ecology; Field (Bourdieu); Margin (machine learning); Biology,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/44272548 https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.1515/jas-2015-0002 https://sciendo.com/article/10.1515/jas-2015-0002 http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-cbb02387-d108-40cf-8c50-d1304417075f https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/jas/59/1/article-p27.xml,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jas-2015-0002,,10.1515/jas-2015-0002,2494911559,,0,012-110-995-744-916; 027-014-479-049-145; 028-506-328-858-591; 031-832-580-445-125; 034-074-315-068-081; 039-248-594-229-122; 039-494-715-681-160; 040-523-045-982-735; 043-626-825-938-840; 047-207-446-547-021; 056-789-845-462-569; 059-361-082-177-816; 060-086-333-706-623; 066-580-174-554-918; 068-372-329-293-22X; 079-478-547-689-067; 086-182-699-354-136; 090-079-071-385-964; 094-506-716-348-263; 112-917-317-852-89X; 114-859-376-855-871; 120-524-273-028-868; 126-846-684-142-93X; 126-891-564-922-985; 134-119-913-312-525; 136-734-966-871-125; 144-964-783-485-276; 150-275-342-089-773; 158-602-348-144-506; 166-770-558-283-400; 196-597-882-769-703,15

Davros; Diane M. Debinski; Kathleen F. Reeder; William L. Hohman,"Filter strips or buffers are areas of grass or other perennial herbaceous vegetation established along waterways to remove contaminants and sediments from agricultural field runoff. In the heavily cultivated regions of the Midwestern United States, these buffer zones established under the Farm Bill provide important habitat for wildlife such as butterflies. The question of how the landscape context of these plantings influences their use has not been adequately researched. We used multiple regression and Akaike's Information Criteria to determine how habitat width and several landscape-level factors (i.e., landscape composition [total herbaceous cover, amount of developed area, and amount of wooded cover] and configuration [herbaceous edge density]) influenced the abundance and diversity of the butterfly community using filter strips in southwestern Minnesota, USA. Habitat-sensitive butterfly abundance and all richness and diversity measures were positively correlated with filter-strip width. Butterfly abundance was negatively associated with the amount of developed areas (cities, towns, and roads) within the area of a 1-km radius (3.14 km2) surrounding the sites. Percentage of wooded cover in the landscape was an important variable explaining individual species abundance, although the direction of the relationship varied. Our finding that landscape context influences butterfly use of filter strips highlights the importance of landscape-level approaches to wildlife conservation in agroecosystems.",34,4,936,943,Wildlife conservation; Conservation Reserve Program; Vegetation; Habitat; Ecology; Geography; Butterfly; Filter strip; Species richness; Abundance (ecology),,,,,https://works.bepress.com/diane_debinski/20/ http://doi.wiley.com/10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[936:BACCRP]2.0.CO;2 https://works.bepress.com/diane_debinski/20/download/ https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND43889805 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/eeob_ag_pubs/26/ https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1033&context=eeob_ag_pubs https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/15250 https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/1/15250/1/DAVROS_et_al-2006-Wildlife_Society_Bulletin_FINAL.pdf https://www.bioone.org/journals/wildlife-society-bulletin/volume-34/issue-4/0091-7648(2006)34%5b936%3aBACCRP%5d2.0.CO%3b2/Butterflies-and-Continuous-Conservation-Reserve-Program-Filter-Strips--Landscape/10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[936:BACCRP]2.0.CO;2.short https://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.2193/0091-7648%282006%2934%5B936%3ABACCRP%5D2.0.CO%3B2 https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2193/0091-7648%282006%2934%5B936%3ABACCRP%5D2.0.CO%3B2 https://core.ac.uk/download/38934950.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[936:baccrp]2.0.co;2,,10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[936:baccrp]2.0.co;2,2018347794,,0,001-429-343-923-981; 002-731-043-544-617; 015-373-969-372-614; 018-827-921-966-336; 023-683-277-287-21X; 027-139-059-151-089; 027-926-257-471-473; 029-466-408-211-758; 047-306-688-458-21X; 048-526-439-246-428; 058-633-444-345-216; 065-998-929-618-767; 070-340-693-154-299; 078-517-244-526-52X; 093-973-227-856-028; 095-104-916-898-838; 096-920-887-442-138; 111-288-588-656-115; 121-382-625-898-652; 132-653-145-372-847; 137-787-371-305-197; 150-085-227-666-662,25

Udawatta; Robert J. Kremer; Brandon W. Adamson; Stephen H. Anderson,"Agroforestry and grass buffers have been shown to improve soil properties and overall environmental quality. The objective of this study was to examine management and landscape effects on water stable soil aggregates (WSA), soil carbon, soil nitrogen, enzyme activity, and microbial community DNA content. Treatments were row crop (RC), grass buffer (GB), agroforestry buffer (AG), and grass waterways (GWW). A corn (Zea mays L.)– soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation under no-till management was established in a watershed in northeast Missouri in 1991; grass buffers were implemented in 1997. Grass buffers, 4.5 m wide and 36.5 m apart, consisted of a mixture of redtop (Agrostis gigantea Roth), brome grass (Bromus spp.), and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) on contour within the watershed. Agroforestry buffers have pin oak (Quercus palustris Muenchh.) trees distributed down the center of the grass buffers on one half of the watershed. Soils were collected from two transects extending from the summit to lower landscape positions within the grass and agroforestry portions of the watershed in June 2006. Soil enzymes studied include: fluorescein diacetate hydrolase, b-glucosidase, glucosaminidase, and dehydrogenase. Soil DNA content was determined as an alternative for microbial biomass. WSA was significantly different among treatments and landscape positions. WSA decreased from GWW > AG > GB > RC management treatments and also decreased from lower > middle > summit landscape positions. Soil carbon and nitrogen were highest for the GWW treatment and lowest for RC. The landscape position effect was significant for RC and AG treatments. Fluorescein diacetate, b-glucosidase and glucosaminidase enzyme activities were significantly higher in buffers and GWW areas than RC areas. Dehydrogenase activity was different between grass (GB and GWW) and crop areas. The landscape effect was insignificant for enzyme activity. Although soil DNA may be a good indicator of microbial biomass, it did not appear to differentiate among management systems as selectively as other microbial parameters. Results of the study show that establishment of AG, GB, and GWW increased WSA, soil carbon, soil nitrogen, and enzyme activity.",39,2,153,160,Soil structure; Soil water; Crop rotation; Lotus corniculatus; Bromus; Environmental science; Soil carbon; Poaceae; Agroforestry; Temperate climate,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139307001801 https://www.ars.usda.gov/sp2UserFiles/Place/36221500/cswq-0373-udawatta.pdf https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/download/12362/PDF https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/12362,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2007.12.002,,10.1016/j.apsoil.2007.12.002,2169670293,,0,003-308-314-084-121; 004-014-866-004-196; 005-742-835-423-082; 008-380-052-396-94X; 013-488-251-380-460; 019-622-915-734-27X; 028-106-711-394-010; 028-146-838-004-688; 033-344-612-422-797; 036-315-734-250-926; 036-466-585-417-013; 038-439-180-047-201; 046-681-813-973-463; 050-920-571-780-924; 051-822-049-360-617; 052-114-914-146-842; 053-948-562-705-723; 056-444-102-079-143; 057-283-555-498-270; 063-219-914-593-853; 067-859-248-307-800; 068-176-168-116-055; 071-167-876-727-598; 073-683-391-633-618; 078-170-172-376-656; 080-632-471-411-293; 081-786-294-386-303; 083-172-644-867-956; 088-017-310-971-747; 092-375-802-763-244; 092-410-436-114-594; 100-679-216-297-456; 102-783-998-273-514; 111-288-588-656-115; 111-651-924-237-336; 121-177-129-261-350; 134-549-967-701-964; 143-523-491-487-595; 145-140-209-097-978; 152-157-521-163-436; 169-090-819-139-141; 170-256-364-738-510; 184-325-051-373-391; 185-116-269-568-509; 186-022-406-900-002; 192-138-006-767-662,115

Smith,"A field monitoring study of a riparian forest buffer zone was conducted to determine the impact of the riparian ecosystem on reducing the concentration of agricultural nonpoint source pollutants. Groundwater samples were collected from 20 sampling locations between May 1993 and December 1994, and analyzed for NO 3 -N, PO 4 , and NH 4 -N. Statistical analyses such as Friedman's test, cluster analysis, cross correlation analysis and Duncan's test were performed for the nutrient data. The study showed that the riparian buffer zone was effective in reducing nitrate concentrations originating from upland agricultural fields. Instream nitrate concentrations were 48 percent less than those measured in the agricultural field. Reductions in concentrations in sampling locations at the wetland edge ranged from 16 to 70 percent. The mean nitrate concentrations in forested hill slope were 45 percent less than concentrations in a well located in an upland agricultural field. Meanwhile, the concentrations of phosphate and ammonia did not follow any specific spatial trend and were generally higher during the summer season for most sampling locations.",34,2,385,395,Riparian zone; Riparian forest; Nonpoint source pollution; Nitrate; Riparian buffer; Hydrology; Environmental science; Wetland; Groundwater; Water pollution,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1998.tb04143.x http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998JAWRA..34..385S/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1998.tb04143.x,,10.1111/j.1752-1688.1998.tb04143.x,2086487484,,0,015-514-563-181-208; 021-187-528-186-865; 028-165-471-396-593; 087-138-533-405-771; 104-682-152-999-776; 141-101-347-131-583; 153-985-431-075-897; 156-507-714-319-110,53

Hale; Samuel K. Riffell; L. Wes Burger; Heidi L. Adams; Jolie G. Dollar,"Native grass conservation buffers established for grassland birds require periodic disturbance, but disturbance of vegetation and soil may increase abundance and activity of imported fire ants (Solenopsis sp.). This is a concern because fire ants are invasive, often respond positively to disturbance and can be a major cause of nest losses in grassland birds. We experimentally tested if fire ant mound density and foraging activity increased after burning and disking in native grass buffers. In 2008, fall disking increased mound density and foraging activity during the first growing season post-disturbance, but burning did not. In 2009, disking had no effect, but effects of disking the previous season persisted into the second growing season. Prescribed fire, which tends to maintain or increase perennial grass cover, may be a better option than disking for managing native grass buffers where fire ant densities are high.",166,2,283,291,Invasive species; Growing season; Foraging; Vegetation; Nest; Ecology; Grassland; Disturbance (ecology); Fire ant; Biology,,,,,https://works.bepress.com/heidi-adams/2/ https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20113361987 https://bioone.org/journals/The-American-Midland-Naturalist/volume-166/issue-2/0003-0031-166.2.283/Fire-Ant-Response-to-Management-of-Native-Grass-Conservation-Buffers/10.1674/0003-0031-166.2.283.pdf https://bioone.org/journals/The-American-Midland-Naturalist/volume-166/issue-2/0003-0031-166.2.283/Fire-Ant-Response-to-Management-of-Native-Grass-Conservation-Buffers/10.1674/0003-0031-166.2.283.short,http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031-166.2.283,,10.1674/0003-0031-166.2.283,2019335472,,0,001-489-745-992-351; 011-250-597-026-87X; 011-621-191-519-711; 017-298-227-855-778; 019-631-064-961-259; 027-126-332-563-55X; 027-983-885-977-695; 040-082-298-184-589; 040-638-827-249-482; 041-160-678-549-313; 059-204-652-381-351; 065-115-952-251-893; 067-110-168-512-877; 075-432-104-979-12X; 076-663-121-778-500; 088-368-707-653-258; 096-885-231-614-151; 097-575-045-941-231; 099-316-498-652-359; 101-679-726-800-134; 105-460-955-854-995; 105-818-997-064-08X; 107-135-395-670-875; 108-019-522-634-067; 109-448-917-217-200; 111-637-517-388-46X; 140-894-755-246-191; 143-454-151-968-118; 144-986-638-368-871; 163-436-050-456-806; 165-800-295-349-057; 197-864-609-077-140,7

Helmers; Heidi Asbjornsen; Randy Kolka; Mark D. Tomer,"summary Intensively managed annual cropping systems have produced high crop yields but have often produced significant ecosystem services alteration, in particular hydrologic regulation loss. Reconversion of annual agricultural systems to perennial vegetation can lead to hydrologic function restoration, but its effect is still not well understood. Therefore, our objective was to assess the effects of strategic introduction of different amounts and location of native prairie vegetation (NPV) within agricultural landscapes on hydrological regulation. The study was conducted in Iowa (USA), and consisted of a fully balanced, replicated, incomplete block design whereby 12 zero-order ephemeral flow watersheds received four treatments consisting of varying proportions (0%, 10%, and 20%) of prairie vegetation located in different watershed positions (footslope vs. contour strips). Runoff volume and rate were measured from 2008 to 2010 (April– October) with an H-Flume installed in each catchment, and automated ISCO samplers. Over the entire study period, we observed a total of 129 runoff events with an average runoff volume reduction of 37% based on the three treatments with NPV compared to watersheds with row crops. We observed a progressively greater reduction across the 3 years of the study as the perennial strips became established with the greatest differences among treatments occurring in 2010. The differences among the watersheds were attributed mainly to NPV amount and position, with the 10% NPV at footslope treatment having the greatest runoff reduction probably because the portion of NPV filter strip that actually contacted watershed runoff was greater with the 10% NPV at footslope. We observed greater reductions in runoff in spring and fall likely because perennial prairie plants were active and crops were absent or not fully established. High antecedent soil moisture sometimes led to little benefit of the NPV treatments but in general the NPV treatments were effective during both small and large events. We conclude that, small amounts of NPV strategically incorporated into corn-soybean watersheds in the Midwest US can be used to effectively reduce runoff.",477,,94,103,Crop yield; Drainage basin; Watershed; Vegetation; Perennial plant; Row crop; Filter strip; Hydrology; Environmental science; Surface runoff,,,,,https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1721&context=abe_eng_pubs https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/64970 https://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/47020 https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/47020 https://core.ac.uk/display/36091653 https://www.fs.fed.us/nrs/pubs/jrnl/2013/nrs_2013_Hernandez-Santana_001.pdf https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/abe_eng_pubs/439/ https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013JHyd..477...94H/abstract https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169412009651 https://works.bepress.com/matthew_helmers/83/ https://www.srs.fs.fed.us/pubs/47020 https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/64970/4/Native%20prairie%20filter%20strips%20reduce%20runoff.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/38932890.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.11.013,,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.11.013,2088105808,,0,000-073-950-100-003; 000-933-635-218-121; 001-869-147-068-585; 002-430-400-638-330; 003-148-094-786-550; 011-962-153-122-815; 012-938-497-872-958; 014-399-584-926-718; 015-404-476-750-989; 019-057-578-554-139; 023-586-411-051-925; 023-818-646-869-756; 024-043-475-626-80X; 025-318-180-360-625; 030-682-084-703-597; 031-302-854-486-488; 034-438-015-172-199; 036-466-585-417-013; 037-537-684-516-668; 038-335-400-539-341; 038-439-180-047-201; 041-606-538-207-737; 042-198-513-831-839; 043-332-678-682-211; 045-412-428-948-577; 045-701-492-592-932; 046-858-036-681-925; 048-126-632-159-980; 048-614-212-390-003; 049-091-169-377-597; 049-773-598-549-535; 057-131-240-501-938; 057-609-524-984-96X; 059-381-194-377-394; 068-406-373-724-27X; 068-997-932-046-194; 071-167-876-727-598; 072-785-749-710-843; 083-149-726-254-365; 083-332-471-417-251; 083-721-851-012-941; 087-680-309-241-290; 088-017-310-971-747; 101-436-533-216-728; 102-299-231-485-20X; 111-323-654-584-502; 113-419-259-532-621; 113-604-919-002-664; 117-534-511-709-388; 121-295-397-898-486; 123-324-136-415-020; 124-154-903-062-906; 127-134-284-709-23X; 128-044-932-510-171; 133-138-314-955-26X; 137-450-452-693-60X; 145-203-559-729-096; 145-772-776-735-820; 146-715-505-404-216; 149-367-063-545-839; 164-811-124-878-023; 166-206-159-722-288; 168-424-180-911-647; 172-475-658-011-870; 176-181-840-447-605; 177-201-206-528-32X; 179-775-405-073-482; 186-314-059-853-436; 187-103-148-209-42X; 197-403-936-641-667; 198-427-699-712-670,55

The most common species in orchards were: Omalium caesum, Dexiogyia corticina, Mocyta orbata, Coprochara bipustulata, Sphenoma abdominale, Drusilla canaliculata, Styloxys insecatus, Palporus nitidulus, Heterothops dissimilis, Mocyta fungi, Pella limbata, Pycnota vicina and Hemitropia sordida.The number of species was high in control plots without any insecticide application and less in integrated pest management plots, where selective insecticides were used. In the wheat fields a total of 798 individuals belonging to 20 species were collected. The most widely occurring species were: Staphylinus caesareus, Tachyporus hypnorum, Philonthus cognatus, Aloconota gregaria, Tachyporus chrysomelinus and T. obtusus. Although species from Tachyporus spp. were dominant in cumulative samples, the activity density decreased considerably for the second half of the vegetation period. The fields' structure and the treatments have a significant role in forming the dominance of species. Also the dynamics of each species is highly influenced by the disturbances. These could be explained with different microclimatic and humidity tolerance of the species. The greater mobility of staphylinids may enable them to avoid pesticide treatments in individual fields. These factors (natural weed cower, the presence of the hedgerows and the flying ability of the species) can interact and offer optimal possibilities for predation in agricultural fields.",,,,,Integrated pest management; Pesticide; Dominance (ecology); Predation; Ecology; Weed; Philonthus cognatus; Tachyporus; Common species; Biology,,,,,,,,,2133429362,,0,017-328-150-792-979; 021-567-740-197-216; 038-950-105-220-885; 045-347-571-315-037; 052-413-535-546-352; 056-162-613-440-505; 089-015-994-801-809; 107-218-380-077-79X; 108-348-943-905-985; 153-195-377-079-785,9

Deasy; John Quinton; Martyn Silgram; Alison Bailey; Bob Jackson; Carly J. Stevens,"Experiences from the Mitigation Options for Phosphorus and Sediment (MOPS) projects, which aim to determine the effectiveness of measures to reduce pollutant loading from agricultural land to surface waters, have been used to contribute to the findings of a recent paper (Kay et al., 2009, Agricultural Systems, 99, 67–75), which reviewed the efficacy of contemporary agricultural stewardship measures for ameliorating the water pollution problems of key concern to the UK water industry. MOPS1 is a recently completed 3-year research project on three different soil types in the UK, which focused on mitigation options for winter cereals. MOPS1 demonstrated that tramlines can be the major pathway for sediment and nutrient transfer from arable hillslopes, and that although minimum tillage, crop residue incorporation, contour cultivation, and beetle banks also have potential to be cost-effective mitigation options, tramline management is the one of the most promising treatments for mitigating diffuse pollution losses, as it was able to reduce sediment and nutrient losses by 72–99% in four out of five site years trialled. Using information from the MOPS projects, this paper builds on the findings of Kay et al. to provide an updated picture of the evidence available and the immediate needs for research in this area.",103,2,105,109,Agriculture; Minimum tillage; Crop residue; Ecology; Stewardship; Water quality; Environmental science; Agricultural land; Water industry; Arable land; Environmental planning,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:agisys:v:103:y:2010:i:2:p:105-109 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X09001085 https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/31067/ http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/25105/ https://core.ac.uk/display/82913419 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/agisys/v103y2010i2p105-109.html https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103063764.html http://oro.open.ac.uk/21205/ https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103063764 https://core.ac.uk/download/82913419.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2009.10.003,,10.1016/j.agsy.2009.10.003,2015674357,,0,000-614-931-902-640; 002-266-095-064-614; 002-289-806-087-524; 002-498-144-852-047; 003-790-424-070-052; 006-013-815-669-532; 010-328-964-049-151; 013-818-250-640-944; 015-894-191-442-602; 019-727-928-471-019; 021-064-526-292-381; 021-500-971-205-053; 023-833-493-505-921; 024-883-925-029-351; 025-094-258-118-813; 027-227-660-430-02X; 030-178-724-012-581; 032-825-239-580-869; 035-943-990-381-491; 041-172-324-318-807; 046-234-795-445-995; 051-475-425-596-284; 052-155-951-017-987; 052-543-668-090-980; 060-107-868-924-977; 063-396-143-999-077; 067-433-726-226-776; 068-843-316-009-830; 080-581-329-922-191; 089-297-847-362-533; 097-625-519-418-614; 111-997-122-331-660; 126-504-030-885-857; 130-773-122-225-864; 133-033-009-404-727; 135-022-117-721-964; 136-986-227-964-046; 138-908-427-094-937; 147-515-682-794-067; 147-891-327-108-586; 147-989-887-595-840; 160-543-263-675-951; 166-525-718-961-188; 172-097-874-551-411; 185-631-332-245-849,36

Anderson; Ranjith P. Udawatta; Clark J. Gantzer,"Agroforestry and grass buffers have been proposed for improving water quality in watersheds. Soil porosity can be significantly influenced by buffer vegetation which affects water transport and water quality. The objective of the study was to compare differences in computed tomography (CT)-measured macroporosity (>1,000-μm diam.) and coarse mesoporosity (200- to 1,000-μm diam.) parameters for agroforestry and grass buffer systems associated with rotationally grazed and continuously grazed pasture systems. Soils at the site were Menfro silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludalf). Six replicate intact soil cores, 76.2 mm diam. by 76.2 mm long, were collected using a core sampler from the four treatments at five soil depths (0–50 cm at 10-cm intervals). Images were acquired using a hospital CT scanner and subsequently soil bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) were measured after scanning the cores. Image-J software was used to analyze five equally spaced images from each core. Bulk density was 5.9% higher and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) values were five times lower for pasture treatments relative to buffer treatments. For the 0–10 cm soil depth, CT-measured soil macroporosity (>1,000 μm diam.) was 13 times higher for the buffer treatments compared to the pasture treatments. Buffer treatments had greater macroporosity (0.020 m3 m−3) compared to pasture (0.0045 m3 m−3) treatments. CT-measured pore parameters were positively correlated with Ksat.

Taylor; Dave Godwin; Jarrod H. Fogarty,"We conducted a 13-year study to determine bird species richness and abundance in field edges maintained in conservation buffers and mowed field edges on two agricultural experiment stations in Mississippi. Both experiment stations were intensively managed for agricultural row crop and dairy production with field edges managed with frequent mowing and herbicide application. Habitat reclamation and management on 41 ha of field edges was initiated on each farm in 1988 and included selective spraying herbicides to control agronomic grasses, cessation of annual mowing, protec- tion from livestock access, and planting legumes and shrubs. We surveyed birds from 1 May through 15 June on permanently established, fixed-width transects in three conservation buffer and three mowed field edges adjacent to row crops on each experimental farm from 1989 through 2001. We de - tected 25 bird species on mowed field edges and 51 species on edges maintained in conservation buffers on both farms. Mean species richness and bird abundance were higher (P < 0.05) on conservation buffers than on mowed field edges on both farms. We attributed higher bird species richness and abundance in conservation buffers to a more diverse habitat structure and increased food plant availability created by native plant succession and shrub plantings. These results support the concept that creation and maintenance of conservation buffers in field edges along row crops can increase bird spe - cies richness and abundance on agricultural lands.",,,,,Native plant; Habitat; Row crop; Shrub; Environmental science; Agricultural land; Species richness; Agroforestry; Transect; Abundance (ecology),,,,,,,,,2181387210,,0,007-416-181-403-689; 033-989-874-629-980; 040-586-336-011-013; 068-258-337-754-12X; 071-829-242-397-54X; 073-798-803-161-275; 082-878-110-460-391; 094-080-626-106-361; 106-949-410-705-316; 140-896-018-128-100; 143-454-151-968-118; 162-932-673-062-383; 184-093-939-018-990,0

Kim; Thomas M. Isenhart; Timothy B. Parkin; Richard C. Schultz; T.E. Loynachan; James W. Raich,"Abstract. Denitrification within riparian buffers may trade reduced nonpoint source pollution of surface waters for increased greenhouse gas emissions resulting from denitrification-produced nitrous oxide (N2O). However, little is known about the N2O emission within conservation buffers established for water quality improvement or of the importance of short-term N2O peak emission following rewetting dry soils and thawing frozen soils. Such estimates are important in reducing uncertainties in current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodologies estimating soil N2O emission which are based on N inputs. This study contrasts N2O emission from riparian buffer systems of three perennial vegetation types and an adjacent crop field, and compares measured N2O emission with estimates based on the IPCC methodology. We measured soil properties, N inputs, weather conditions and N2O fluxes from soils in forested riparian buffers, warm-season and cool-season grass filters, and a crop field located in the Bear Creek watershed in central Iowa, USA. Cumulative N2O emissions from soils in all riparian buffers (5.8 kg N2O-N ha−1 in 2006–2007) were significantly less than those from crop field soils (24.0 kg N2O-N ha−1 in 2006–2007), with no difference among the buffer vegetation types. While N2O peak emissions (up to 70-fold increase) following the rewetting of dry soils and thawing of frozen soils comprised 46–70% of the annual N2O emissions from soils in the crop field, soils in the riparian buffers were less sensitive to such events (3 to 10-fold increase). The ratio of N2O emission to N inputs within riparian buffers (0.02) was smaller than those of crop field (0.07). These results indicate that N2O emission from soils within the riparian buffers established for water quality improvement should not be considered a major source of N2O emission compared to crop field emission. The observed large difference between measured N2O emissions and those estimated using the IPCC's recommended methodology (i.e., 87% underestimation) in the crop field suggests that the IPCC methodology may underestimate N2O emission in the regions where soil rewetting and thawing are common, and that conditions predicted by future climate-change scenarios may increase N2O emissions.",6,1,607,650,Riparian zone; Riparian forest; Soil water; Nonpoint source pollution; Riparian buffer; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science; Greenhouse gas; Denitrification,,,,,http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1218&context=eeob_ag_pubs https://works.bepress.com/thomas_isenhart/58/ https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/6/607/2009/bgd-6-607-2009.pdf https://works.bepress.com/jim_raich/22/download/ https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009BGD.....6..607K/abstract https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/bgd-2008-0147/ https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/eeob_ag_pubs/219/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bgd-6-607-2009,,10.5194/bgd-6-607-2009,2064091118,,0,000-439-957-255-861; 000-542-848-030-810; 000-933-635-218-121; 002-199-299-750-774; 002-366-294-773-665; 002-937-270-631-538; 005-515-575-341-821; 007-240-071-601-549; 009-379-307-440-518; 009-895-283-404-897; 012-597-700-992-945; 014-045-448-228-968; 014-560-350-901-997; 014-768-754-999-313; 015-537-977-204-336; 016-140-576-843-357; 016-216-735-430-372; 016-475-292-873-68X; 016-962-712-491-943; 017-709-159-607-177; 018-537-849-154-88X; 019-897-475-251-41X; 023-923-178-342-877; 026-931-122-861-538; 027-386-920-294-895; 027-823-972-181-107; 028-716-688-385-439; 028-802-252-344-012; 031-521-973-430-153; 031-540-953-436-703; 031-911-929-410-650; 032-420-479-586-623; 032-799-798-113-881; 036-902-840-704-756; 038-439-180-047-201; 039-010-174-687-899; 040-229-676-588-390; 045-483-901-061-196; 046-729-998-989-866; 046-838-665-978-125; 048-148-537-416-261; 048-948-865-364-355; 051-830-014-198-867; 053-980-181-429-956; 063-932-709-526-882; 064-240-859-714-503; 069-685-977-197-15X; 070-171-023-805-414; 074-088-259-080-980; 075-015-864-957-620; 076-049-038-650-311; 078-026-432-837-556; 078-885-838-695-135; 079-196-971-304-319; 080-268-439-482-149; 081-382-108-138-592; 082-848-132-695-426; 084-253-680-547-061; 087-972-727-088-705; 088-175-727-127-094; 088-236-621-248-724; 090-235-500-995-608; 091-507-667-867-467; 092-043-536-126-478; 094-220-383-468-828; 095-263-397-244-602; 097-400-866-532-844; 097-783-604-729-760; 098-638-478-619-258; 099-431-463-200-284; 101-012-916-569-644; 103-112-301-998-208; 103-141-730-898-275; 103-343-401-486-232; 103-989-366-241-549; 105-027-928-982-484; 106-735-246-652-211; 108-531-822-357-682; 109-130-999-939-986; 111-293-161-251-748; 115-642-860-718-878; 118-690-527-436-688; 120-075-843-630-244; 122-193-974-026-944; 125-401-076-290-201; 125-587-605-251-178; 127-785-284-544-120; 130-084-777-945-13X; 130-819-612-827-412; 131-350-616-096-363; 131-436-496-230-413; 134-216-684-686-244; 135-184-421-404-164; 141-101-347-131-583; 147-602-317-956-860; 148-805-925-269-964; 153-985-431-075-897; 161-939-014-674-55X; 163-021-586-740-587; 166-519-155-744-540; 167-952-558-294-226; 168-228-690-607-508; 170-327-959-504-92X; 176-658-844-592-805; 177-075-230-799-424; 179-668-787-180-887; 180-524-585-737-168; 186-231-509-533-744; 188-210-692-322-91X; 189-818-900-851-958; 191-760-728-152-874,25

The effects of biotic and abiotic factors on the distribution of three species of satyrid butterfly (Aphantopus hyperantus, Pyronia tithonus and Maniola jurtina) in arable field margins were studied in a block of arable farmland on a North Hampshire farm. 2. Non-floral factors affecting distribution included the degree of shelter, insolation, width of hedgebank or grass verge, and uncultivated habitat. Farm tracks adjacent to the field boundaries exerted a negative effect on abundance. 3. Floral variables affecting distribution included the abundance of flowers of bramble (Rubus fruticosus), thistle-like Compositae, marjoram (Origanum vulgare) and mayweeds (Matricaria spp.) in conservation headlands. Negative variables included abundance of cow parsley (Anthriscus sylvestris) and old man's beard (Clematis vitalba); although the latter was negative for A. hyperantus and M. jurtina, it was a positive variable for P. tithonus. 4.

Smith; Deanna L. Osmond; Christopher E. Moorman; Jon M. Stucky,"Riparian buffers can be valuable refuge areas for wildlife in otherwise homogeneous agricultural landscapes. Government sponsored programs like the Cropland Reserve Program generally require the planting of specifi c vegetative spe- cies during buffer restoration, although the effectiveness of such an approach when compared to restoration by volunteer species is unknown. We studied the effect of differences in vegetation structure on avian habitat in riparian buffer zones. A 25 m (82 ft) wide planted woodland buffer, 30 m (98 ft) wide grass, shrub, and woodland three-zone buffer, and a 9 m (30 ft) wide shrub buffer were evaluated for habitat potential using breeding-bird counts and vegetation surveys. Bird density and spe- cies richness varied with the structure of the vegetative communities present at the three sites. Avian species richness and total detections were higher in the three-zone buffer than in both the shrub and planted buffer, likely a result of the diversity of vegetation at the site. These data suggest that restoration of riparian areas by allow- ing fallow vegetation to recolonize is at the very least equally benefi cial to avian wildlife as is restoration by planting specifi c grass, shrub, and tree species. Buffer restoration by natural revegetation using this method could be recommended as an alternative to implementation by planting riparian species due to its simplicity and cost effectiveness.",7,2,277,288,Riparian zone; Vegetation; Ecology; Woodland; Revegetation; Riparian buffer; Shrub; Cost effectiveness; Environmental science; Species richness,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/20203995 https://bioone.org/journals/Southeastern-Naturalist/volume-7/issue-2/1528-7092(2008)7[277:EOVMOB]2.0.CO;2/Effect-of-Vegetation-Management-on-Bird-Habitat-in-Riparian-Buffer/10.1656/1528-7092(2008)7[277:EOVMOB]2.0.CO;2.short,http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/1528-7092(2008)7[277:eovmob]2.0.co;2,,10.1656/1528-7092(2008)7[277:eovmob]2.0.co;2,2098328920,,0,003-354-248-456-210; 011-880-292-361-884; 016-070-496-157-110; 016-437-799-863-096; 022-707-789-227-525; 033-350-981-094-427; 038-659-320-814-260; 040-585-141-057-797; 044-315-002-495-725; 058-504-262-835-977; 065-245-132-160-895; 075-731-436-057-973; 078-312-557-460-956; 082-802-246-722-388; 092-010-579-589-586; 096-074-282-606-638; 113-900-387-576-996; 128-132-547-489-716; 133-199-519-838-349; 147-663-418-904-997; 176-325-204-558-566; 183-701-177-923-440; 193-598-530-261-354,18

Carabid beetles were sampled using pitfall traps at six different locations: grassy field boundary, 0 (field edge), 4, 11, 24 and 49 m distance from the field edge, in two fields of winter wheat (Wageningen, the Netherlands) during the spring and early summer of 2004. The assemblage of carabid beetles was highly diverse, consisting of 75 species. Carabid activity-density was low in the boundary compared to the field. Within the field, it was highest at the edge and decreased towards the field centre. Species richness, standardized to the number of individuals, did not differ between sampling locations. Based on the within-field distribution three ecological groups of carabids were distinguished: (i) boundary species; (ii) field-interior species and (iii) field-edge species. Because species within one genus differ in their response to the boundary, the importance of studies at species level is stressed.",122,4,427,434,Biotope; Biodiversity; Field (geography); Genus; Ecology; Spatial distribution; Biological dispersal; Species richness; Biology; Sampling (statistics),,,,,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Alibrary.wur.nl%3Awurpubs%2F356144 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880907000941 http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/356144,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2007.02.013,,10.1016/j.agee.2007.02.013,2064419427,,0,001-245-537-689-947; 004-617-209-098-463; 008-225-619-668-580; 010-945-646-716-071; 011-508-246-956-659; 014-396-882-188-748; 014-809-297-009-430; 019-123-430-272-496; 023-486-208-338-439; 024-182-448-289-246; 029-264-530-643-997; 029-447-584-528-902; 030-697-919-654-984; 036-017-685-871-375; 039-839-177-684-866; 041-768-237-199-317; 044-050-646-677-718; 047-711-433-977-172; 050-985-622-056-969; 058-192-427-115-768; 064-893-774-544-494; 069-379-822-515-162; 073-332-568-126-247; 110-684-291-574-379; 121-383-641-405-47X; 134-921-760-522-115; 152-313-018-301-223; 161-644-427-039-572; 194-423-080-424-612; 194-464-477-426-158,53

Rewa; John Myers,"Although riparian buffers established along streams in agricultural landscapes are expected to provide water-quality functions similar to natural ecosystems, few studies have documented specific changes in the condition of aquatic resources resulting from buffer establishment. In 2000 the Commonwealth of Virginia, USA, began an extensive cooperative venture under the Chesapeake Bay Initiative to establish riparian buffers on agricultural lands, primarily through United States Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). Prior to CREP implementation, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) developed a regionally tailored fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for use as a watershed assessment technique in Northern Virginia. Using this regional IBI framework, we evaluated the effects of recently established riparian buffers on aquatic condition. Within the geographic scope of the regional IBI, we evaluated all buffer segments planned between 2000 and 2003. Cumulatively during this period, we assessed stream physical condition on 36 buffer sites and 12 reference sites using the NRCS Stream Visual Assessment Protocol (SVAP); we also assessed the aquatic community at these sites using the IBI. Improvements in stream condition were clearly demonstrated at certain sites within one year of buffer establishment. Although not all buffer projects responded with positive trends, mean SVAP and IBI scores for buffered sites increased over the course of the study, whereas the trend on reference sites was level or slightly downward. We observed positive IBI response at sites with highly disturbed local conditions prior to buffer establishment combined with small, relatively undisturbed watersheds above. Simple solutions such as buffer establishment alone cannot be expected to protect streams from adverse human impacts that occur at a broader scale. Therefore, riparian restoration should be planned and carried out in concert with other conservation practices at a watershed scale in a way that maximizes buffer effectiveness.",34,4,927,935,Riparian zone; Agriculture; Watershed; Ecology; Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program; Riparian buffer; Natural resource; Environmental science; STREAMS; Water resource management; Index of biological integrity,,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[927:ACRTRB]2.0.CO;2/full https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2193/0091-7648%282006%2934%5B927%3AACRTRB%5D2.0.CO%3B2 https://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.2193/0091-7648%282006%2934%5B927%3AACRTRB%5D2.0.CO%3B2 https://www.jstor.org/stable/4134301 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2193/0091-7648%282006%2934%5B927%3AACRTRB%5D2.0.CO%3B2 http://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND43889804 https://bioone.org/journals/wildlife-society-bulletin/volume-34/issue-4/0091-7648(2006)34%5b927%3aACRTRB%5d2.0.CO%3b2/Aquatic-Condition-Response-to-Riparian-Buffer-Establishment/10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34%5B927:ACRTRB%5D2.0.CO;2.full http://doi.wiley.com/10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[927:ACRTRB]2.0.CO;2 https://bioone.org/journals/wildlife-society-bulletin/volume-34/issue-4/0091-7648(2006)34[927:ACRTRB]2.0.CO;2/Aquatic-Condition-Response-to-Riparian-Buffer-Establishment/10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[927:ACRTRB]2.0.CO;2.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[927:acrtrb]2.0.co;2,,10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[927:acrtrb]2.0.co;2,2107792391,,0,002-828-610-935-931; 010-083-294-693-008; 013-960-910-763-50X; 015-295-394-979-253; 016-487-715-732-773; 029-294-447-653-235; 035-922-130-197-966; 040-806-887-128-56X; 047-440-171-070-340; 051-779-591-169-256; 052-685-650-885-578; 057-727-962-585-077; 059-605-387-511-625; 061-161-857-117-719; 066-458-858-078-351; 068-997-932-046-194; 080-169-492-347-620; 102-441-024-207-762; 111-131-334-729-243; 113-994-438-709-147; 127-031-673-117-965; 128-373-399-847-303; 150-364-048-358-64X; 189-738-474-429-219,31

Udawatta; Harold E. Garrett; Robert L. Kallenbach,"Conservation practices including agroforestry and grass buffers are believed to reduce nonpoint source pollution (NPSP) from pastured watersheds. Agroforestry, a land management practice that intersperses agricultural crops with trees, has recently received increased attention in the temperate zone due to its environmental and economic benefits. However, studies are limited that have examined buffer effects on the quality of water from grazed pastures. Six treatment areas, two with agroforestry buffers, two with grass buffers, and two control treatments were used to test the hypothesis that agroforestry and grass buffers can be used to effectively reduce NPSP from pastured watersheds. Vegetation in grass buffer and pasture areas includes red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) and lespedeza (Kummerowia stipulacea Maxim.) planted into fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.). Eastern cottonwood trees (Populus deltoides Bortr. ex Marsh.) were planted into fescue in agroforestry buffers. Soils at the site are mostly Menfro silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludalfs). Treatments were instrumented with two-foot H flumes, water samplers, and flow measuring devices in 2001. Composite water samples were analyzed for sediment and total nitrogen after each runoff event to compare treatment differences. Treatments with agroforestry and grass buffers had significantly lower runoff volumes as compared to the control. The loss of sediment and total nitrogen were smaller for the buffered treatments. The results of this study suggest that establishment of agroforestry and grass buffers help reduce NPSP pollution from pastured watersheds. It is anticipated as trees grow and roots occupy more soil volume, the reduction in N in runoff will increase on the agroforestry watershed.",79,1,81,87,Loam; Soil water; Nonpoint source pollution; Festuca arundinacea; Grazing; Water quality; Eastern Cottonwood; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Agroforestry; Agronomy,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-010-9288-9 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-010-9288-9 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/782157 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103162661,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-010-9288-9,,10.1007/s10457-010-9288-9,2052007376,,0,003-656-358-763-223; 004-771-960-697-150; 005-046-617-641-306; 007-978-572-198-146; 008-540-892-409-627; 018-371-327-648-607; 020-694-982-646-438; 030-637-232-264-440; 034-083-543-468-970; 040-292-160-017-257; 047-279-054-681-048; 055-486-051-386-205; 057-586-835-109-493; 057-857-628-677-326; 066-766-200-834-012; 071-507-648-651-331; 081-782-589-807-648; 088-017-310-971-747; 109-526-468-458-578; 111-288-588-656-115; 128-967-284-462-815; 169-090-819-139-141; 183-143-735-590-924; 192-557-387-321-774,39

We then use the choice experiment method to examine public preferences for three landscape features – hedgerows, farm buildings and scrubland – in the Monts d’Arree region (in Brittany, France), in the context of re-design of landscape conservation policy by the local environmental institute. Surveys were undertaken on two user groups, visitors and local residents. Our objective was to obtain empirical evidence of the difference between the preferences of tourists and residents, for landscape attributes. We then analysed the welfare changes of tourists and residents affected by different landscape programmes. Our results point out the strong divergence between the landscape preferences of the public and those of local public actors. The comparison of the estimated values of willingness to pay for single-attribute landscaping action shows some divergence between residents’ and tourists’ ranking of preferences for agricultural landscape areas. Finally, we find, at least for the socio-economic context examined in this study, that apart from its social, cultural and aesthetic values, rural landscape has economic values, and that agricultural landscape preservation tends to be more beneficial to low-income social groups.",83,4,318,326,Welfare; Agriculture; Regional science; Empirical evidence; Landscaping; Social group; Land-use planning; Geography; Willingness to pay; Context (language use); Environmental protection,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204607001387 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204607001387,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2007.05.013,,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2007.05.013,2146957936,,0,001-362-199-882-05X; 003-659-907-827-298; 006-207-712-491-984; 010-195-457-296-442; 012-445-521-918-448; 031-810-415-073-770; 035-776-610-863-582; 041-684-051-531-053; 043-434-210-939-330; 043-572-477-925-718; 044-942-614-127-037; 049-910-359-846-40X; 051-613-010-997-062; 056-496-966-212-532; 057-657-809-679-383; 068-789-689-250-577; 071-674-642-056-169; 078-581-156-350-030; 088-659-729-299-827; 089-468-883-189-639; 091-917-222-986-705; 096-992-181-947-700; 100-440-892-234-712; 106-653-949-616-859; 107-781-135-837-372; 114-685-371-109-418; 116-662-795-910-859; 121-799-282-909-64X; 126-061-052-053-058; 130-282-073-277-329; 131-048-718-892-320; 134-772-380-318-431; 137-320-762-612-929; 147-824-212-663-256; 163-775-862-947-738; 168-106-348-621-405; 195-199-201-721-385,111

The EU ‘Nitrates Directive’ (Directive 91 ⁄ 676 ⁄ EEC) and the WFD (Water Framework Directive 2000 ⁄ 60 ⁄ EEC) introduced a series of measures designed to reduce and prevent water pollution caused or induced by nitrates from agricultural sources. Therefore, there is an urgent requirement to control the nitrate concentration in freshwater. The objective of this paper was to verify the potential capacity of a specifically designed afforested riparian zone in removing the excess of nitrogen from river water. 2. A buffer zone was set with irrigation ditches, to produce a subsurface water flow carrying water from the study river through the buffer strip to drainage ditches. This experimental system enables the co-occurrence of two main processes: vegetation ⁄ microbial nitrogen uptake and denitrification. Both in situ denitrification and denitrification potential were measured at different soil depths, and nitrogen removal of water passing through the buffer system was measured. 3. After the first year, high removal rates (63–64%) of total nitrogen in water were recorded. The lowest rate of denitrification took place in the upper soil layer, while maximum denitrification occurred in the medium layer (40–55 cm). Denitrification occurred mainly in the first few metres of the irrigation ditches leading away from the river. The denitrification rates clearly increased from the second to the third year, with highest rates in summer and autumn. Denitrification potential indicated that carbon availability was the most limiting factor. 4. Synthesis and applications. This study has demonstrated that nitrogen levels can be reduced in rivers by forcing water to circulate through afforested buffers. Nitrogen was removed both by plants and by microbial denitrification. Such activity can be supported by promoting anoxic conditions through appropriate water flow management. This could be achieved by creating semi-natural floodplains where water flows can be efficiently managed as in a drained wetland.",48,5,1135,1144,Subsurface flow; Riparian zone; Eutrophication; Ecology; Water quality; Water flow; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Denitrification; Environmental engineering; Water pollution,,,,,https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02025.x https://www.acquerisorgive.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Journal-of-Applied-Ecology.pdf http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02025.x/abstract https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02025.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02025.x http://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND44760255 https://core.ac.uk/display/53451678,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02025.x,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02025.x,2117386056,,0,002-366-294-773-665; 002-570-479-419-484; 004-564-524-148-882; 007-260-832-996-388; 008-422-030-312-12X; 015-075-787-498-325; 015-514-563-181-208; 017-917-296-565-694; 018-800-193-760-785; 019-956-026-948-622; 020-162-258-114-150; 021-264-049-632-756; 029-294-447-653-235; 037-869-723-647-435; 039-860-735-667-734; 040-665-244-257-257; 044-456-125-092-896; 047-857-691-947-082; 051-607-714-466-701; 060-696-157-887-32X; 061-912-798-524-529; 076-551-861-300-215; 088-526-158-902-16X; 088-590-628-546-902; 092-370-833-437-326; 093-184-946-875-581; 100-845-850-323-114; 102-006-996-908-647; 103-848-538-051-911; 104-993-597-055-071; 105-505-394-565-996; 110-480-586-717-651; 114-392-766-318-899; 125-765-250-241-518; 130-113-631-399-199; 141-101-347-131-583; 168-228-690-607-508; 176-961-483-594-048; 179-792-835-023-017; 186-231-509-533-744,25

Brühl,"Abstract In agricultural landscapes, field margins are potential habitats for moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera). However, because of their proximity to agricultural sites, field margins can be affected by inputs of pesticides and fertilizers. In the present study, we assessed the use of field margins by caterpillars as habitat. Furthermore, the effects of realistic field margin input rates of various agrochemicals on moths, especially on their caterpillar stages, were studied in field, semi-field, and laboratory experiments. Our monitoring results indicate that, although caterpillars were found in field margins, their mean abundance was 35–60% lower compared to meadows. In a field experiment, the insecticide treatment (pyrethroid, lambda-cyhalothrin) significantly reduced the number of caterpillars and only 15% of the sampled caterpillars occurred in the insecticide-treated plots. Furthermore, the insecticide affected the community composition of the caterpillars, whereas the fertilizer treatment slightly increased the caterpillar abundance. In laboratory experiments, Mamestra brassicae caterpillars were shown to be very sensitive when exposed to insecticide-treated leaves (rate that kills 50% of the test caterpillars (LR50) after 48 h: 0.78% of the recommended field rate; this rate corresponds to the arable spray drift input in field margins at a distance of 3–4 m from the crop), and the caterpillars also appeared to avoid feeding on the treated leaves. In addition, in a semi-field study, 40% fewer eggs of Hadena bicruris moths were found on Silene latifolia plants sprayed with the insecticide compared to control plants and the flowers of insecticide-treated plants were less likely to be pollinated by moths. Overall, these studies illustrate that moths use field margins as habitats and that they can be affected by realistic input rates of agrochemicals. As caterpillars are important prey organisms and adult moths can act as pollinators, inputs of agrochemicals in field margins should be reduced to maintain biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.",207,,153,162,Pollinator; Crop; Pesticide; Pollination; Lepidoptera genitalia; Predation; Caterpillar; Agronomy; Field experiment; Biology,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Melanie_Hahn5/publication/275218785_The_effects_of_agrochemicals_on_Lepidoptera_with_a_focus_on_moths_and_their_pollination_service_in_field_margin_habitats/links/553a1b5c0cf245bdd7623639.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880915001346,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2015.04.002,,10.1016/j.agee.2015.04.002,2048634258,,0,003-079-703-747-674; 005-119-127-982-532; 010-777-820-136-567; 010-871-531-175-560; 011-726-790-203-306; 012-531-996-361-584; 015-452-961-176-032; 016-479-451-858-996; 017-617-892-949-438; 018-860-777-046-547; 019-792-723-425-474; 020-550-742-896-582; 022-418-213-259-750; 022-438-869-235-426; 023-896-277-403-275; 024-176-803-210-82X; 033-729-706-192-459; 034-281-941-035-983; 034-650-492-697-500; 035-232-166-827-095; 037-908-404-608-059; 038-305-195-221-272; 043-213-251-246-857; 045-341-621-939-351; 045-628-056-763-549; 045-845-890-255-360; 046-513-869-126-279; 048-164-819-953-006; 048-550-347-828-56X; 050-907-802-597-89X; 052-363-993-930-092; 054-190-974-057-937; 056-244-188-471-763; 056-789-845-462-569; 058-652-902-995-042; 059-106-092-531-26X; 059-502-071-789-055; 059-591-995-881-051; 061-266-379-556-653; 061-515-851-860-160; 063-003-550-683-547; 064-314-121-953-160; 066-173-478-189-114; 072-410-559-402-62X; 073-703-689-720-592; 074-793-529-288-006; 075-222-492-546-135; 084-932-304-217-75X; 087-403-027-064-454; 090-918-892-557-975; 096-986-804-938-077; 097-108-057-805-779; 098-863-802-212-865; 100-194-169-502-836; 104-519-739-211-685; 110-883-392-022-284; 114-480-653-531-829; 117-345-687-903-78X; 125-995-631-935-63X; 136-377-088-150-806; 137-057-794-081-178; 140-373-290-241-230; 140-804-099-486-389; 140-908-676-431-836; 142-624-071-999-929; 150-260-537-510-335; 153-513-858-008-911; 157-398-673-150-430; 162-199-054-878-245; 165-804-108-473-473; 190-423-081-433-021,18

Sosnoskie; Edward C. Luschei; Mark A. Fanning,"Abstract The importance of managing weeds in seminatural habitats that are adjacent to farm fields is unclear. Weedy-margin vegetation may harbor pests or pathogens and may also serve as source populations for ongoing immigration of weeds into the field. It is also possible, however, that margin vegetation provides habitat for organisms that consume weed seeds or suppress the likelihood of pest or pathogen outbreak. We examined the nature of margin habitat using spatial-scaling of weed-species richness as an ecological assay. In 2003, we recorded the occurrence of weedy species along the perimeters of 63 fields in Wisconsin. The fields were distributed within six counties that differed in topography, geological history, local climate, and soil type and which spanned the range of variability in the agricultural landscape. We identified seven habitats that differed in geology and land use. The relationship between species richness and margin class was estimated using an analog of the power law.

Soil organic matter (SOM), and especially biologically-active soil organic matter, is considered to be an important soil quality indicator variable because of it has relationship to critical soil functions like erodibility and the capacity of the soil to act as an environmental buffer. The objectives of this study were to examine trends in SOM C accrual and to quantify intra-seasonal changes in SOM C and particulate organic matter (POM) C for each vegetation zone of a MRBS seven years after establishment on previously cultivated or heavily grazed soil. Total SOM C and POM C in soil under perennial vegetation (poplar, switch- grass and cool season grass) were significantly higher than under cropped soil. Total POM C changed within vegetation type over the four month study period, whereas total SOM C did not. After six growing seasons, SOM C increased 8.5% under poplar grown in association with cool season grass, and 8.6% under switchgrass. The results are very promising and suggest that changes in SOM C can occur in a relatively short time after the establishment of perennial vegetation in a MRB. These changes should increase the ability of MRB soil to process non- point source pollutants.",44,2,133,140,Soil functions; Soil organic matter; Soil quality; Vegetation type; Panicum virgatum; Environmental science; Organic matter; Soil series; Agronomy; Soil biodiversity,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1006261519080.pdf https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/for_pubs/4/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1006261519080 https://works.bepress.com/richard_schultz/11/download/ https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&context=for_pubs https://works.bepress.com/thomas_isenhart/24/ https://www.nrem.iastate.edu/class/assets/For460-560/Managing%20AFS_hydrological%20functions/marquez%20et%20al.%2019991.pdf,https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/for_pubs/4/,,,1485172348,,0,000-819-621-472-197; 002-937-270-631-538; 016-835-768-298-85X; 030-167-160-472-529; 038-659-320-814-260; 054-292-788-964-67X; 064-656-493-555-374; 074-510-606-885-507; 121-468-243-703-60X; 122-673-427-042-411; 127-873-219-629-427; 142-991-714-464-106; 152-642-696-148-368,55

Mickelson; James L. Baker,"Several processes take place within vegetated buffer strips that affect their performance. To better understand; these processes, a runoff study was conducted to evaluate vegetated buffer strips performance in reducing atrazine,; metolachlor, and chlorpyrifos transport as affected by the drainage area to buffer strip area ratio. The simulated runoff water; mixed with pesticide–treated soil was distributed onto six vegetated buffer strips, each 1.52 m wide . 20.12 m long, located; downslope of the inflow distribution tank in a well established vegetated grassed waterway. These strips provided for three; replications of two inflow rates designated as “drainage area/buffer strip area ratio treatments” of 15:1 and 30:1. Infiltration; for the 15:1 treatment averaged 38.8% of the inflow volume, whereas it averaged 30.4% for the 30:1 treatment. Sediment; retention efficiencies averaged 90.1% and 86.8% for the 15:1 and 30:1 treatments, respectively. Concentrations of atrazine; and metolachlor associated with sediment outflows from the strips were larger than their respective inflow concentrations,; while the results were opposite for chlorpyrifos. Concentrations in runoff water for both atrazine and metolachlor in outflow; from the strips were smaller than the inflow concentrations; again, the results were opposite for chlorpyrifos. The 15:1; treatment retained an average of 52.5% of the total input of atrazine, 54.4% of metolachlor, and 83.1% of chlorpyrifos.; Corresponding numbers for the 30:1 treatment were 46.8% for atrazine, 48.1% for metolachlor, and 76.9% for chlorpyrifos.; Analysis of variance using the randomized block design showed that differences of percent retention of pesticide between; treatments were not significant for any of the three pesticides at the 10% significance level. A lack of significant difference; indicates either a need for more than three replications and/or larger area ratio treatments to be studied. The results of this; study indicate that a 30:1 area ratio buffer strip could perform equally as well as a 15:1 area ratio buffer strip. Thus, less; land would be required under buffer strips to get the desired results.",46,3,635,644,Infiltration (hydrology); Randomized block design; Metolachlor; Atrazine; Grassed waterway; Water quality; Hydrology; Environmental science; Buffer strip; Surface runoff,,,,,https://elibrary.asabe.org/abstract.asp?aid=13599 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/abe_eng_pubs/6/ https://works.bepress.com/steven_mickelson/4/ http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=abe_eng_pubs https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=659122 https://core.ac.uk/display/38933353 https://core.ac.uk/download/38933353.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/2013.13599,,10.13031/2013.13599,2032673271,,0,009-742-460-635-737; 014-561-967-561-763; 016-590-002-431-159; 021-205-902-522-221; 024-556-636-186-088; 034-748-846-517-673; 049-737-378-018-005; 051-778-290-958-089; 052-649-552-903-981; 052-894-240-545-387; 062-508-385-160-239; 064-662-281-730-944; 076-826-572-086-275; 089-389-691-942-205; 090-577-145-445-395; 091-276-989-494-901; 094-352-151-470-229; 096-878-710-039-072; 103-148-967-328-600; 103-286-115-762-912; 115-445-992-300-112; 133-346-579-113-056; 140-725-847-725-141; 198-427-699-712-670,59

Winkler; Felix L. Wäckers; Aad J. Termorshuizen; Joop C. van Lenteren,"The use of flowering field margins is often proposed as a method to support biological control in agro-ecosystems. In addition to beneficial insects, many herbivores depend on floral food as well. The indiscriminate use of flowering species in field margins can therefore lead to higher pest numbers. Based on results from field observations and laboratory experiments we assessed risks as well as benefits associated with the provision of nectar plants in field margins, using Brussels sprouts as a model system. Results show that Brussels sprouts bordered by nectar plants suitable for the cabbage white Pieris rapae L., suffered higher infestation levels by this herbivore. In contrast, nectar plants providing accessible nectar for the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella L., did not raise densities of P. xylostella larvae in the Brassica crop. Margins with Anethum graveolens L., selected on the basis of its suitability as nectar plant for parasitoids, significantly increased the number of adult Diadegma semiclausum Hellen in the crop. This didn’t translate into enhanced parasitism rates, as parasitism of P. xylostella by D. semiclausum exceeded 65 % in all treatments, irrespective of the plants in the field margin. Our findings emphasize the importance of taking a multitrophic approach when choosing flowering field margin plants for biocontrol or other ecosystem services.",55,6,719,727,Biological pest control; Nectar; Pieris rapae; Beneficial insects; Diamondback moth; Animal ecology; Herbivore; Pest control; Botany; Agronomy; Biology,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/29238283 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10526-010-9296-8/fulltext.html https://edepot.wur.nl/175112 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103366981 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103366981.html http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/407552 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10526-010-9296-8.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10526-010-9296-8 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/29238283.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-010-9296-8,,10.1007/s10526-010-9296-8,2072566542,,0,000-999-762-967-231; 002-633-921-701-657; 003-478-207-180-929; 011-343-261-784-127; 011-405-279-408-315; 011-508-246-956-659; 011-784-213-196-607; 012-466-311-051-172; 013-622-912-963-60X; 013-655-026-583-208; 021-595-332-317-205; 023-269-484-535-446; 023-533-111-677-935; 024-902-398-168-296; 027-164-254-872-513; 028-732-453-835-677; 034-148-476-928-766; 040-182-369-950-331; 040-477-314-227-099; 041-720-279-642-994; 041-959-179-512-628; 042-149-075-992-606; 042-195-189-711-603; 044-405-697-969-681; 048-526-486-928-659; 051-920-982-817-943; 066-839-397-580-750; 068-684-584-040-812; 074-860-251-070-527; 082-857-610-495-598; 082-858-046-996-889; 084-483-711-591-086; 090-657-055-801-720; 095-026-354-929-83X; 110-071-393-060-035; 110-155-622-866-138; 129-057-294-163-230; 134-811-779-504-489; 134-826-427-007-958; 145-447-582-272-531; 152-413-903-196-268; 179-412-102-487-503; 183-001-348-665-523; 183-542-901-027-95X; 185-648-164-128-344; 194-595-863-937-394; 196-755-527-175-688,73

Location: Lepsama River watershed, Nurmijarvi, Southern Finland. Methods: Species diversity indicators included both richness and evenness. Plant communities in buffer strips were surveyed in 29 sampling sites. Using ArcGIS Desktop 9.0 (ArcInfo) and Fragstats 3.3 for GIS analysis, the landscape composition around each sampling site was characterized by seven parameters in square sectors at five scales: 4, 36, 100, 196, and 324 ha. For each scale, Principle Component Analysis was used to examine the importance of each structural metric to diversity indicators using multiple regression and other simple analyses. Results: For all but the smallest scales (4 ha), two structural metrics including the diversity of land cover types and percentage of arable land were positively and negatively correlated with species richness, respectively. Both metrics had the highest correlation coe...",11,2,269,278,Species evenness; Ecology; Geography; Alpha diversity; Land cover; Buffer strip; Agricultural land; Species richness; Species diversity; Arable land; Forestry,,,,,https://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.3170/2008-7-18426 https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/publications/multi-scale-responses-of-plant-species-diversity-in-semi-natural- https://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND44034918 https://bioone.org/journals/Applied-Vegetation-Science/volume-11/issue-2/2008-7-18426/Multi-scale-responses-of-plant-species-diversity-in-semi-natural/10.3170/2008-7-18426.short https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3170/2008-7-18426 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/172815,http://dx.doi.org/10.3170/2008-7-18426,,10.3170/2008-7-18426,2025337210,,0,000-271-857-070-759; 001-360-678-718-282; 003-164-963-858-748; 003-767-257-404-370; 005-797-042-774-155; 006-601-600-444-433; 011-125-668-693-475; 011-429-712-338-44X; 013-458-617-723-054; 013-934-843-606-934; 014-565-331-662-321; 017-516-181-294-137; 021-235-588-198-319; 022-418-213-259-750; 023-008-231-051-085; 028-007-964-940-610; 028-917-029-117-685; 029-388-608-227-593; 030-986-721-241-456; 033-100-401-287-969; 039-505-502-984-134; 040-110-065-478-83X; 043-922-856-983-819; 046-249-813-326-028; 046-464-517-703-193; 047-949-455-932-004; 050-460-199-380-662; 052-604-525-638-386; 053-117-300-654-615; 053-137-818-248-134; 058-873-945-232-52X; 060-817-436-334-38X; 063-617-276-329-073; 065-289-632-112-106; 065-932-639-593-926; 066-347-110-782-638; 066-807-757-722-083; 068-452-604-669-157; 070-093-567-451-393; 072-175-913-783-721; 082-797-391-654-568; 085-454-631-928-842; 091-656-115-318-186; 097-135-941-783-666; 099-446-746-314-03X; 104-230-585-135-474; 109-842-969-650-554; 112-124-785-410-62X; 115-537-551-650-895; 116-860-639-239-693; 121-230-767-263-342; 130-698-554-759-854; 142-624-071-999-929; 145-653-851-729-665; 155-378-411-198-767; 172-018-522-836-888; 176-506-367-701-104; 177-019-961-113-610; 179-599-537-784-673; 189-701-100-136-017; 189-930-776-324-498; 193-192-566-363-66X; 195-156-912-495-61X,14

Kujawa,"Protection of high biodiversity in an intensively farmed areas is strongly related to managing the diverse structure of a landscape, for example by planting shelterbelts. The study was aimed at recognition of avifauna dynamics in young (with the age of 1–4 years at the beginning of the study) shelterbelts (N=9) and at estimation of their importance for farmland birds. Bird density was estimated by mapping method in successive years 1996–2001 and the data were combined and analysed in respect to age of shelterbelts. Eighteen breeding species were found (5–8 pairs km–1), among them most abundant were Corn Bunting (Miliaria calandra) (with dominance of 33%), Yellow Wagtail (Motacilla flava) (19%) and Whitethroat (Sylvia communis) (12%). No trend in the changes of species richness and total density was recorded. The density of species preferring building nests and/or feeding in herb layer (like Yellow Wagtail, Skylark Alauda arvensis and Whinchat Saxicola rubetra) decreased during study period while the density of species associated to higher layers of vegetation like Yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella), Red-backed Shrike (Lanius collurio) increased. According to earlier study, bird species richness and abundance in studied young shelterbelts were lower than in several dozens years old ones. However, in relation to species colonization both classes of shelterbelts (species building their nests on the ground or in low shrubs), young shelterbelts were as important as old ones.",52,4,433,443,Ecology; Geography; Corn bunting; Alauda; Shrike; Lanius collurio; Yellowhammer; Emberiza citrinella; Saxicola rubetra; Species richness,,,,,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-article-6f93dbc4-c278-488f-927f-6b8fc104bf64,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-article-6f93dbc4-c278-488f-927f-6b8fc104bf64,,,2047088526,,0,003-493-278-314-619; 029-904-475-177-008,7

El trabajo de campo se realizo en un area de 500 ha entre Palacio y Pedrun (42o 43� 26�� 42o 46� 15�� S-N, 5o 29� 58�� 5o 30� 55�� E-O, 900-1.000 m s.n.m.), en el valle del rio Torio, provincia de Leon. La densidad de poblacion se estimo mediante transectos lineales y mapeo de parejas. Los registros de parejas transportando material de nido en el pico, construyendo un nido y acarreando ceba en el pico se distribuyeron en intervalos de 10 dias. La seleccion del sitio-nido se estimo mediante el indice de Jacobs. Para determinar el exito de los nidos solo se consideraron los encontrados en una etapa temprana de construccion. Para establecer las tasas de aprovisionamiento, cada nido con pollos se observo durante un minimo de 3 h. El numero de ayudantes en cada nido cada dia se dedujo del numero maximo de adultos distintos cebando a los pollos al mismo tiempo, restando los dos individuos que formaban la pareja. La densidad de poblacion fue c. 6-10 aves/10 ha. La disgregacion de los bandos de invierno y la formacion de parejas sucedio habitualmente desde el comienzo de febrero, la construccion de nidos entre el 11 de marzo y el 10 de abril, la puesta e incubacion entre el 11 y el 30 de abril, y la presencia de pollos en mayo. Probablemente pocas parejas volvieron a nidificar despues de fracasar. Los habitats mas comunes en los alrededores de los nidos fueron setos y robledales. Dos tercios de los nidos fueron emplazados en arbustos y el resto en arboles. Las zarzas del genero Rubus fueron muy preferidas como soporte de los nidos. El exito de los nidos fue muy bajo (c. 18%) y el fracaso ocurrio principalmente antes de la eclosion debido a depredacion. No se detecto comportamiento de ayuda hasta que los nidos contenian pollos. La cria cooperativa se verifico en el 60% de los nidos, y ocurrio en todos los habitats y estratos de vegetacion. El numero final de ayudantes por nido fue entre uno y cuatro, habitualmente uno o dos. Solo se registraron valores por encima de 40 visitas al nido en una hora cuando habia al menos un ayudante, y por encima de 50 visitas con dos o mas ayudantes. En conclusion, (i) en el area de estudio se encontraron condiciones optimas de habitat para el mito comun; (ii) varias caracteristicas de la ecologia de cria coincidieron con las ampliamente descritas en habitats similares en el Reino Unido; (iii) probablemente se dieron los mismos factores determinantes para el comportamiento de ayuda en ambos lugares, con gran importancia del bajo exito reproductor.

Studies were carried out in the Gen. D. Chlapowski Landscape Park near Turew, Western Poland (16045’E, 52001’W). The age of shelterbelts vegetation affected soil mesofauna of adjacent fields in a diverse way. The mean density of mites amounts 7.4 × 103ind. m–2 and 2.6 × 103 ind. m–2 respectively for the shelterbelts and fields. Densities of Acarina communities were affected not only by the presence of a shelterbelt (P = 0.000) but also its age (P = 0.02) and the distance from it (P = 0.000), and these effects were similar in spring and autumn (P = 0.08). The mean density of springtail noted in shelterbelts of different age was 2.0 × 103 ind. m–2 and in the field sites 2.2 × 103 ind. m–2. Although the effect of the shelterbelts’ age on the density of Collembola was not found (P = 0.3), the densities were different in shelterbelts and in adjacent fields (P = 0.006) but statistical significance was found only between spring and autumn (P = 0.000). The distance from the shelterbelt influenced (though less intensely) the density of Collembola on adjacent field (P = 0.01). Eighteen species of Collembola were found in studied shelterbelts and fields. Isotoma notabilis Schaff. usually dominated in shelterbelts. Its contribution to abundance of communities varied depending on the age of shelterbelts (in 6 years old shelterbelt it constituted as many as 71% of the whole community). In 11 years old shelterbelt Schoetella ununguiculata (Tullb.), was more common than Isotoma notabilis Schaff. and in the 170 years old shelterbelt the dominant species was Onychiurus armatus (Tullb.). Friesea mirabilis (Tullb.), Proisotoma minuta (Tullb.), Isotoma notabilis or Onychiurus armatus dominated in adjacent fields though their contribution was depended on shelterbelt’s age and on the distance from it.",55,4,637,646,Windbreak; Soil mesofauna; Vegetation; Ecology; Springtail; Collembola <class>; Species diversity; Transect; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-article-71d967d0-db13-4437-92dd-f09cb1ba1752,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-article-71d967d0-db13-4437-92dd-f09cb1ba1752,,,2022592927,,0,010-423-042-177-734; 014-416-811-048-401; 025-236-956-549-929; 029-013-184-968-011; 034-841-117-369-785; 041-879-047-466-340; 042-341-835-403-764; 057-001-477-328-971; 061-545-891-234-284; 080-735-658-767-793; 087-402-714-925-055; 096-258-501-738-54X; 121-383-641-405-47X; 121-499-310-834-063; 131-597-476-940-415; 149-795-067-767-472; 158-498-105-839-226; 169-283-275-911-72X; 193-154-897-835-230,4

Significantly more pseudoscorpions were found in old compared to new margins, suggesting they may be attracted to litter build-up over time. Pseudo- scorpion numbers were reduced on treatments subjected to two cuts annually, particularly when a summer cut was included, although this effect was ameliorated when the cuttings were left. However, pseudo- scorpions were most numerous on treatments which involved no management because of the increase in leaf litter which may replicate a woodland environment. Adjacent hedges appear to buffer the effects of management: margins with adjacent hedges (rather than ditches or tracks) having more individuals.

Sharpe,"Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations have declined on a continental scale. One factor implicated in the decline is habitat loss through agricultural modernization. To better understand the relationship between north- ern bobwhite and modern farming, and to examine farm habitat improvement methods, we monitored bobwhite (N = 218) from April to September 1993 and 1994 on two study areas, western (WSA) and eastern (ESA), each divided into one filter strip (FS) (treatment) and one non-filter strip (NFS) (reference) section on Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge's farming units in Dare County, North Carolina. Filter strips were 9.4 m wide planted and natural vegetation buffer zones surrounding drainage-ditches in crop fields. Using radio-telemetry, we followed bobwhite, identified nest incubations and hatchings, and monitored hatched broods. We examined the null hypotheses that number of captures, distances to first nest from capture site, number of nest incubation initiations, nest success, and adult and brood survival would be identical on FS and NFS sections. With equal effort, there were 142 and 65 bobwhite captured on the WSA FS and NFS sections, and 75 and 48 bobwhite captured on the ESA FS and NFS sections, respectively. Pooling data across areas, sections, and years, 42 quail initiated 53 clutches. There were 31 and 3 incubations initiated on the WSA FS and NFS sections, respectively. There were 13 and 6 incubations initiated on the ESA FS and NFS sections, re- spectively. Pooling across areas, sections, and years there was 1 incubation/3 and 1 incubation/8 transmittered bobwhite on FS and NFS sections, respectively. Pool- ing clutch (N = 28) data for all areas, sections, and years, clutches averaged 11.7 (SE = 0.75), and declined over time (P = 0.006).

Novak,"With the increased number of large animal production facilities in eastern North Carolina, nutrient accumulation is becoming a problem in surface waters and groundwater. To protect these water sources, management practices to reduce nutrient movement or accumulation are being evaluated using computer models. The computer models, Groundwater Loading Effects of Agricultural Management Systems (GLEAMS) and a version of Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM), were used to estimate nitrogen and phosphorus transport of nutrients through a riparian buffer zone from an agricultural field that received swine lagoon effluent. The models simulated annual application rates of effluent equivalent to 500 and 1000 kg N/ha. The GLEAMS model provided the weather data and nutrient concentrations in the soil, sediment, and leachate for input into REMM. Assuming a 1000 kg N/ha loading rate, GLEAMS monthly average NO3-N leachate concentrations were within 14% of the observed data, and REMM-simulated NO3-N leachate concentration was within 5% of the observed data. Both models provided an adequate estimation of nitrogen transport through the system. GLEAMS simulations of PO4-P leachate followed the general trend of observed data. However, there was no apparent response in simulated PO4-P leachate concentrations for the two loading rates (95 and 190 kg P/ha), indicating a problem in the phosphorus calculations in the model. The REMM-simulated PO4-P leachate was greater than observed concentrations and was affected by the inputs obtained from GLEAMS. The pre-release version of REMM provided good estimates of the nutrient transport, and with a few improvements, official releases of REMM have the potential to provide better estimates of nutrient movement through the riparian buffer zone.",,,,,Riparian zone; Nutrient; Effluent; Riparian forest; Leachate; Riparian buffer; Hydrology; Environmental science; Phosphorus; Groundwater,,,,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/17888 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/download/17888/PDF,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/17888,,,2958390198,,0,,0

Gilley; L. A. Kramer; T. B. Moorman,"ABSTRACT: Runoff losses of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from field applied manure can contribute to surface water pollution. Grass hedges may reduce runoff losses of nutrients and sediment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of narrow switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) hedges (−0.75 m wide) on the transport of P and N from a field receiving beef cattle feedlot manure under tilled and no-till conditions. This study was conducted on a steep (12 % average slope) Monona silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls) soil near Treynor, Iowa. The experiment was a split-plot with no-till and disked systems as main plots and subplots of manure, fertilizer, and check with or without a grass hedge. A rainfall simulator was used and runoff was collected from both the initial and the following wet simulations. Only 38% of the no-till plots and 63% of disked plots had any runoff during the initial 6.4 cm hr−1 water application. A single narrow grass hedge reduced runoff concentrations of dissolved P (DP) by 47%, bioavailable P (BAP) by 48%, particulate P (PP) by 38%, total P (TP) by 40%, and NH4-N by 60% during the wet simulation on the no-till plots receiving manure, compared with similar plots with no hedges. The corresponding reductions in concentrations as a result of a grass hedge for DP, BAP, PP, TP, and NH4-N on the disked plots were 21, 29, 43, 38, and 52%, respectively. Runoff NH4-N concentration from fertilizer applied to the disked plots was reduced by 61%, NO3-N by 21%, and total N (TN) by 27% during the wet simulation when grass hedges were used. Grass hedges also reduced total quantities of DP, BAP, TP, and NH4-N during the wet simulation. The TP loss was 3.3% of applied P fertilizer and was 0.3% of applied manure P. Narrow grass hedges were effective in reducing P and N losses in runoff from both manure and fertilizer application.",55,2,172,176,Loam; Soil water; Eutrophication; Panicum virgatum; Fertilizer; Manure; Environmental science; Surface runoff; Agronomy; Mollisol,,,,,https://www.jswconline.org/content/55/2/172 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/17111 https://www.jswconline.org/content/55/2/172.full.pdf https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/biosysengfacpub/128/ https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20001915647 http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1127&context=biosysengfacpub https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=707765,https://www.jswconline.org/content/55/2/172,,,1888844715,,0,029-227-515-568-324; 057-131-240-501-938; 065-179-468-781-895; 076-826-572-086-275; 089-389-691-942-205; 144-279-645-115-466,78

Composition of the fauna varied according to crop type and position within the field. Proximity of a hedgerow had a major impact upon population dynamics, with more species and a greater over all abundance near field edges. It was the major factor governing the abundance of Isotomurus palustris and Bourletiella hortensis, whereas crop type was most important in determining numbers of Jeannenotia stachi, Sminthurus viridis, Sminthurinus elegans and Lepidocyrus spp. Temporal variation in species abundance was also clear: abundances of J. stachi, B. hortensis, I. palustris and Lepidocyrtus spp. decreased through the sampling period while those of S. viridis and Isotoma viridis increased. Overall, the management practices associated with the two crops were an important determinant of collembolan abundance but not of species composition.",,,,,Epigeal; Relative species abundance; Fauna; Crop; Ecology; Sminthurus viridis; Population; Bourletiella hortensis; Agronomy; Abundance (ecology); Biology,,,,,http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/51314/,http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/51314/,,,188389483,,0,002-669-748-682-425; 013-633-903-307-188,21
