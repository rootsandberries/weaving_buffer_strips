Overwintering polyphagous predator density and composition was compared within a mid-field overwintering refuge (“beetle bank”) and two conventional hedgebanks over a 5-year period. During the study predator densities in the beetle bank were similar to or greater than those in the conventional hedgebanks. Whilst predator densities remained relatively stable in both of the hedgebanks over time, densities fluctuated significantly within the beetle bank. Many of the species recorded on the beetle bank are considered to be important predators of cereal aphids. The results are discussed in terms of the implications of creating such a habitat for the biological control of cereal aphids.",1

The rationale for the study was that replicated buffer plot studies had shown that vegetated buffers will effectively assimilate N, but it was not known whether or not they would work at a larger scale. The study was conducted on a commercial farm near Tifton, Georgia. Wastewater was pumped from a single-stage anaerobic lagoon to vegetated buffers composed of grass and mature or newly planted pines. The buffers approximated 60 m in length by 90 m in width. The upper 10 m of each buffer was in grass, while the downslope area was in mature or newly planted pines. Six buffers were instrumented for wastewater application and water quality monitoring. Two buffers received wastewater at a 1X rate (600 kg N ha-1 year-1), two at a 3/4X rate (450 kg N ha-1 year-1), and two served as controls. The wastewater was applied to the 10 m grassed portion of the buffers. Transects of shallow groundwater wells starting at the grass-forest interface and running downslope were used to monitor water quality N. The study showed mixed results concerning N assimilation by the buffers. Upslope land use changes by the producer during the study added significant N inputs to one set of buffers, and they were unable to assimilate sufficient N from both these inputs and the wastewater to protect shallow groundwater quality. In contrast, almost all samplings of shallow groundwater under the buffers receiving N only from the overland flow applied swine lagoon effluent showed nitrate (NO3-N) concentrations 20 and 30 m downslope to be lower than 10 mg L-1 (drinking water standard). On these buffers, NO3-N concentrations in shallow groundwater were near background levels five years after wastewater application commenced. The study indicated that the ratio of buffer area width to wastewater application area width on the landscape should be at least 1:1, and that buffers for protection of water quality should be continuous on the landscape. It was concluded from the study that buffers can be used at the farm scale to assimilate N from applied wastewater when they are sufficiently wide relative to waste application area, rate, and other N sources at the farm scale.",0

In fact, many objects may have different sensitivities to wind and often require different degrees of wind protection. Since commonly used indexes do not consider the sensitivity to wind, a concept of specific protection efficiency is developed. A critical windspeed is used to represent the sensitivity of each object. Windspeeds greater than this value are considered damaging. A dimensionless protection index is defined to evaluate windbreak efficiency. The maximum index value is 1 for the highest protection, and the index is negative when sheltered windspeed is greater than the critical windspeed. This index can be compared, summed, and averaged across different windbreaks, objects, and leeward locations. A sample of critical windspeed values was compiled from the literature. The index was evaluated using actual wind data measured under both sheltered and open conditions. The results indicated that the index can be used for evaluating windbreak effectiveness in terms of objects protected under various conditions. This model could be used as a tool for windbreak-related research and policy making.",0

High buffer strip effectiveness (BSE) has been reported for sloping shallow aquifers, but experimental data for plain landscapes with deeply permeable soils is lacking. We tested a novel method to determine BSE on a 20-m-deep, permeable sandy soil. Discharge from soil to ditch was temporarily collected in an in-stream reservoir to measure its quantity and quality, both for a BS and a reference (REF) treatment. Treatments were replicated once for the first, and three times for the next three leaching seasons. No significant BSE was obtained for nitrogen and phosphorus species in the reservoirs. Additionally, water samples were taken from the upper groundwater below the treatments. The effect of BS for nitrate was much bigger in upper groundwater than in the reservoirs that also collected groundwater from greater depths that were not influenced by the treatments. We conclude that measuring changes in upper groundwater to assess BSE is only valid under specific hydrogeological conditions. We propose an alternative experimental set-up for future research, including extra measurements before installing the BS and REF treatments to deal with spatial and temporal variability. The use of such data as covariates will increase the power of statistical tests by decreasing between-reservoir variability.",0

Here, we describe the Pacific Northwest component of Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment, phase II (LINX II) to examine how land-use setting influences fates of NO3− in streams. We used 24 h releases of a stable isotope tracer (15NO3-N) in nine streams flowing through forest, agricultural, and urban land uses to quantify NO3− uptake processes. NO3− uptake lengths varied two orders of magnitude (24–4247 m), with uptake rates (6.5–158.1 mg NO3-N m−2 day−1) and uptake velocities (0.1–2.3 mm min−1) falling within the ranges measured in other LINX II regions. Denitrification removed 0–7% of added tracer from our streams. In forest streams, 60.4 to 77.0% of the isotope tracer was exported downstream as NO3−, with 8.0 to 14.8% stored in wood biofilms, epilithon, fine benthic organic matter, and bryophytes. Agricultural and urban streams with streamside forest buffers displayed hydrologic export and organic matter storage of tracer similar to those measured in forest streams. In agricultural and urban streams with a partial or no riparian buffer, less than 1 to 75% of the tracer was exported downstream; much of the remainder was taken up and stored in autotrophic organic matter components with short N turnover times. Our findings suggest restoration and maintenance of riparian forests can help re-establish the natural range of NO3− uptake processes in human-altered streams.",0

Specific objectives were pursued to determine seasonal fluctuations of the microbial populations from the input water to a drainage ditch, conveying back the flux into the river after passing through the soil of the wooded riparian strip. The bacterial communities were determined by combined approaches involving cultivation, microscopic methods and DNA based techniques to determine both culturable and total microbial community in water. The results indicate that the size of the bacterial population, including the culturable fraction, increases from the river to the drainage ditch especially on the warm season. The multiple approach here adopted enabled also to demonstrate that the special condition created in the buffer strip supports the development and the metabolism of the microbial community. The nature of the bacterial population, in terms of phylotypes distribution, was investigated by 16S rDNA analysis indicating that the most represented genera belong to Gamma-proteobacteria, which is known to include an exceeding number of important pathogens. In spring, the effect of the buffer strip seems to significantly reduce such a sub-population. The changes observed for the total bacterial community composition become much evident in summer, as revealed by both denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis cluster analysis and by the diversity index calculation.

From May 2002 through May 2003, orthophosphate or dissolved reactive phosphate (DRP) concentrations in ground water were measured at successive distances from the field edge through 12 m of riparian buffers of both giant cane and mixed hardwood forest along three streams draining agricultural land in the Cache River watershed in southern Illinois. Giant cane and mixed hardwood forest did not differ in their DRP sequestration abilities. Ground water DRP concentrations were significantly reduced (14 percent) in the first 1.5 m of the buffers, and there was an overall 28 percent reduction in DRP concentration by 12 m from the field edge. The relatively low DRP reductions compared to other studies could be attributed to high DRP input levels, narrow (12 m) buffer lengths, and/or mature (28 to 48 year old) riparian vegetation.",0

Abstract:  Riparian forest buffers established according to accepted conservation practice standards have been recommended as one of the most effective tools for mitigating nonpoint source pollution. The midwestern United States is characterized by many kilometers of narrow, naturally occurring forests along streams. However, little is known about the relative effectiveness of these remnant forests compared with these newly established buffers. This study compared the ability of naturally occurring remnant forests with and without adjacent planted grass filters to buffer concentrated flow paths (CFPs) originating in crop fields along first- and second-order streams in three northeast Missouri watersheds. Remnant forests breached by runoff through CFPs were narrower than those that dispersed 100% of the CFPs. Remnant forests with adjacent grass buffers were nearly twice the width as those without grass filters. We also found that CFPs, which developed within remnant forests and at the base of in-field grass waterways, were potential sources of sediments to streams. Methods to mitigate these CFPs warrant further investigation. Our study suggests that although these natural remnant forests provide substantial buffering capacity, both improved management and/or the addition of an adjacent grass filter would improve water quality by reducing sediment loss to streams. Inferences can be used to inform the design and management of similar conservation buffer systems within the region.",0

The results of the study indicated food supply to be important for both predator species during the winter period, although the role of biotic factors in site selection in the autumn could not be clearly demonstrated. The winter distribution of the two species could, however, be explained well in terms of abiotic factors. It is suggested that these and other similar predator species have well-defined overwintering requirements and that these can be exploited in the management of field boundary habitats.",1

Several published papers demonstrate that integration of shelterbelts with agroecosystems offers positive outcomes, such as better yield, more congenial microclimate, and greater organic matter levels. None- theless, soil biological diversity, the driver of greater organic matter levels, has not been convincingly tested and veri- fied yet. In addressing this gap, we measured abundance and diversity of populations of arthropods and fungi in three 11-year old shelterbelts integrated with pasture to determine whether a correlation exists between the abundance of and diversity in populations of arthropods and fungi in two seasons: late autumn-early winter (May-June 2011) and late winter-early spring (August-September 2011). Litter from the soil surface and soil from two depths were sam- pled at increasing distance from the midpoint of shelterbelts for the extraction of arthropods and isolation culturing of fungi. The relationship among distance, depth and biodiversity of different groups of arthropods and fungi was analysed using linear regression. We found that over both seasons arthropod abundance in the litter and soil declined with increasing distance from the midpoint of the shelterbelts, and with soil depth. However, fungi abundance in ei- ther season was not affected by proximity to the shelterbelt but increased with greater soil depth. Distance from the shelterbelt midpoints did not bear an impact on the diversity richness of both arthropods and fungi.",1

N2O emissions were greater in the agricultural zone, whereas complete denitrification to N2 was greater in the riparian zone. In general, the targeted denitrifier community abundance did not change between agricultural and riparian zones. However, nosZ gene expression was greater in the riparian zone than the agricultural zone.

Prey biomass and density decreased from the centre of the hedge to the crop margin and to the centre of the crop, where prey density was low but prey biomass was moderate. Starved and satiated beetles were released in circular enclosures and recaptured using pitfall traps for 6 days. 3. Immediately after release, starved P. melanarius were significantly more active than satiated beetles, but this difference disappeared after the first day. At each recapture date, starved individuals had gained weight whereas satiated individuals had lost weight. The analysis of activity and weight variation at the end of the first day indicated that the centre of the crop seemed to be the most favourable habitat for starved individuals to find food rapidly, whereas the behaviour of satiated individuals was identical in all habitats. 4. This experiment shows that habitat use of P. melanarius is flexible. The results are discussed in the context of the classical view of foraging behaviour in carabid beetles. The activity and foraging efficiency in P. melanarius in different habitats can be explained as the result of the interaction between individual satiation state, prey availability in the habitat, and particular preferences of the species.",0

The adsorption coefficient for HA was 48% higher in VFS compared with CS, but desorption was not statistically different between soils. Adsorption and desorption coefficients for DEA and DIA were not statistically different between soils. The predicted order of mobility in CS is HA < atrazine = DIA = DEA. In VFS, the predicted order of mobility is HA < atrazine = DIA < DEA. These data indicate that the higher organic carbon in VFS will likely retard the transport of atrazine and HA to surface and ground waters; however, the transport rates of DEA and DIA will be similar between soils.",1

A geographic information system (GIS)-based tool was developed and tested that employs terrain analysis to account for spatially nonuniform runoff and produce more effective filter strip designs. The computer program, AgBufferBuilder, runs with ArcGIS versions 10.0 and 10.1 (Esri, Redlands, California) and uses digital elevation models to identify detailed spatial patterns of overland runoff to field margins. The tool then sizes filter dimensions according to those patterns using buffer area ratio relationships. The resulting design is larger along segments where more runoff flows and smaller along segments where runoff is less and delivers a constant level of trapping efficiency around the field margin for sediment and sediment-bound pollutants. The tool also can estimate trapping efficiency of existing filter strips or hypothetical configurations. In a validation test, estimates of sediment trapping efficiency using the tool9s assessment function compared closely to measurements taken on large field plots in central Iowa. Using AgBufferBuilder, designs developed for a sample of fields in the midwestern United States were estimated to trap nearly double the sediment, on average, during a design storm than constant-width configurations having equivalent total filter area. AgBufferBuilder can be used to bolster environmental performance of filter strips where runoff is spatially nonuniform.

The size-stability distribution in addition to estimating aggregate-size distribution distinguishes between amounts of stable and unstable macroaggregates (>250 μm). The determination of aggregate-size stability distribution involves the assumptions that soil aggregates can be categorized in terms of their size and water stability (slaking resistance). Experimentally this procedure involves the slaked and capillary-wetted pretreatmeats; and a subsequent slaking treatment of aggregates >250 μm in size. We also propose the stable aggregates index (SAT) and the stable macroaggregates index (SMal) for studying soil stability based on aggregate resistance to staking. These indices account for the total weighted average of stable aggregates and the total weighted average of stable macroaggregates, respectively. Both the SAI and the SMaI indices were shown to be sensitive to the effects of vegetation on soil stability under different riparian buffer communities. The SAI and the SMaI indices were higher in surface soils under cool-season grass than any of the other treatments.

1
 Understanding the spatial dynamics of insect distributions in farmland can provide insights into their ecological requirements and potential for management. Identifying the scale, location and persistence of species’ aggregations is an important step towards understanding the factors driving population distributions. This study examined how different carabid species were distributed in field and field margin habitats, and analysed their spatiotemporal dynamics.

2
 We sampled 156 locations in a grid of pitfall traps over approximately 1 ha, comprising a hedgerow and adjacent parts of two arable fields. Traps were monitored between June and November 1994 to provide data with high spatial and temporal resolution of the two-dimensional distributions of six carabid beetle taxa.

3
 The pattern of carabid activity-density over the experimental site was displayed in a series of contour plots. Spatial analyses by distance indices (SADIE) were used to provide aggregation indices (Ia) for the distributions of carabid species at different times.

4
A second SADIE index (Im) of spatial association between two sets of counts was used to measure the spatial stability of species’ aggregation patterns through time. Im was also used to measure association or dissociation between the distributions of different species, and the spatial association between a species’ distribution and an environmental variable.

5
 Each taxon was aggregated most of the time, but different taxa aggregated in patches within the field and/or hedgerow to different and varying extents. The field boundaries were important for some species, either as the only habitat in which they occurred (Amara spp.), as the major focus of more widespread distribution (Harpalus rufipes), or as a seasonal refuge (Nebria brevicollis). Within the crop habitat, different species also occupied different areas, providing some evidence to suggest species packing in space.

6
 Spatial distributions between consecutive samples were strongly and positively associated, indicating stability of patch location over short time-scales. The strength of the association in turn was correlated with activity-density. When time lags were introduced between sample distributions, some negative association indices indicated displacement of patches. In most cases, however, positive association was maintained over long periods, demonstrating patch stability.

7
 The spatial stability of patches suggests that future studies should focus on the detailed measurement of biotic and abiotic factors associated with patch location. Identifying the underlying causes of population distributions in farmland has important implications for managing habitat to enhance populations of beneficial predators, and targeting insecticide applications in precision agriculture to minimize their adverse side-effects.",0

Since the 1970s, governments have introduced agri-environment schemes (AES) aimed at mitigating this impact, but information on their success is limited. A five y, farm-scale experiment was conducted to test the efficacy of England's Environmental Stewardship AES in enhancing the species richness and abundance of small mammals (voles Cricetidae , mice Muridae , and shrews Soricidae ) in an intensively-farmed arable landscape. Small mammal communities were sampled in spring and autumn on grassy field margins installed under the Entry Level Scheme (ELS) tier of Environmental Stewardship, where 1% of cropped land was converted to wildlife habitats. Results were compared with those from field margins on a second, experimental treatment (ELS Extra: ELSX) in which 5% of cropped land was taken out of production, and also field margins on a conventionally-farmed control treatment (‘cross compliance’: CC). Species richness and abundance of small mammals showed a significant increase on all treatments in spring and autumn. Many increases were greater on ELS and ELSX field margins compared to the CC controls, but there was little evidence that ELSX was more beneficial than ELS, and there were species-specific differences. Voles were not detected on any treatment in the initial sampling period but bank voles Myodes glareolus rapidly became abundant thereafter, particularly on ELS and ELSX field margins, and field voles Microtus agrestis also colonised. Wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus were present on all treatments in all sampling periods, but spring abundance declined as vole abundance increased. These results suggest that the Entry Level Scheme tier of the English agri-environment scheme is effective in enhancing small mammal communities on arable farmland, with potential benefits for higher trophic levels via their predators.",0

In this study, we show that landscapes composed of higher proportions of organic crop fields support more bee species at greater abundances in fallow strips. An increase in organic cropping in the surrounding landscape from 5% to 20% enhanced bee species richness in fallow strips by 50%, density of solitary bees by 60% and bumble bee density by 150%. Bee species richness and bumble bee density responded strongest to organic cropping in landscape sectors with 500 m radius, solitary bee density in landscape sectors with 250 m radius. The most likely source of these results is that crop and noncrop habitats are strongly connected via bee foraging at the landscape scale. It seems likely that bees depending on nesting sites in fallow strips benefited from the more abundant flower resources provided by broadleaved weeds in organic crop fields. We conclude that the incorporation of organic crop fields into conventionally managed agricultural landscapes can provide food resources needed to sustain greater pollinator species richness in noncrop habitats.",0

Overland flow samples were collected at the field edge and at 3.3 m, 6.6 m, and 10.0 m within the riparian buffers during 19 precipitation events over a 1-year period. On an annual basis, significant sediment reductions occurred by 3.3 m and 6.6 m in the cane and forest buffers, respectively. The giant cane buffer reduced incoming sediment mass by 94% within the first 3.3 m, while the forest buffer reduced sediment by 86% over 6.6 m. Within 10.0 m of the field edge, the cane and forest buffers reduced sediment mass by 100% and 76%, respectively. On a seasonal basis, the cane buffer outperformed the forest buffer. During each of the four seasons, the cane buffer reduced sediment masses within 3.3 m of the field edge, while the forest buffer showed initial reductions occurring at 6.6 m during the summer, fall, and winter. No detectable reductions occurred during the spring in the forested buffer. Reductions in sediment concentrations were less evident compared to mass basis, indicating that infiltration may be a more important sediment reduction mechanism than particle settling.

Agroforestry buffers, 4.5 m wide and 36.5 m apart, consisted of pin oak (Quercus palustris Munchh.) trees planted among redtop (Agrostis gigantea Roth) and brome (Bromus spp.) grasses and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.). Two replicates of intact soil cores (76-mm diam. by 76-mm long) were collected from the 0- to 100-mm depth. Cores were scanned at a voxel size of 73 by 73 by 84 μm. Images were analyzed with Three-Dimensional Medial Axis (3DMA) software. The average pore paths for grass and agroforestry buffer samples were three and five times greater, respectively, than for RC. On average, buffer samples had a 33% higher characteristic coordination number than RC samples. Buffer samples had a higher characteristic path length constant (2.18 times the RC treatment) and an average lower path tortuosity (89% of the RC treatment) relative to values for RC. Average nodal pore volume and throat radii of buffers were 1.8 and 2.9 times larger, respectively, than for RC. Results show that three-dimensional structural differences caused by variations in root growth or organic matter accumulation discriminated between buffer and row crop soil, allowing better quantification of management effects on soil porosity.",0

Agroforestry, a land management practice that intersperses agricultural crops with trees, has recently received increased attention in the temperate zone due to its environmental and economic benefits. However, studies are limited that have examined buffer effects on the quality of water from grazed pastures. Six treatment areas, two with agroforestry buffers, two with grass buffers, and two control treatments were used to test the hypothesis that agroforestry and grass buffers can be used to effectively reduce NPSP from pastured watersheds. Vegetation in grass buffer and pasture areas includes red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) and lespedeza (Kummerowia stipulacea Maxim.) planted into fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.). Eastern cottonwood trees (Populus deltoides Bortr. ex Marsh.) were planted into fescue in agroforestry buffers. Soils at the site are mostly Menfro silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludalfs). Treatments were instrumented with two-foot H flumes, water samplers, and flow measuring devices in 2001. Composite water samples were analyzed for sediment and total nitrogen after each runoff event to compare treatment differences. Treatments with agroforestry and grass buffers had significantly lower runoff volumes as compared to the control. The loss of sediment and total nitrogen were smaller for the buffered treatments. The results of this study suggest that establishment of agroforestry and grass buffers help reduce NPSP pollution from pastured watersheds. It is anticipated as trees grow and roots occupy more soil volume, the reduction in N in runoff will increase on the agroforestry watershed.",0

Five equally spaced images were acquired from each core and were analyzed with Image-J software. The CT-measured soil macroporosity was 13 times higher (0.053 m 3 m- 3 ) for the buffer treatments than the pasture treatments (0.004 m 3 m -3 ) for the surface 0- to 10-cm soil depth. Buffer treatments had greater macroporosity (0.02 m 3 m- 3 ) than RG (0.005 m 3 m -3) or CG (0.004 m 3 m -3 ) treatments. The K sat values for buffer treatments were five times higher than pasture treatments. Soil bulk density was 5.6% lower for the buffer treatments than the pasture treatments.

During the (1991-1997) calibration and subsequent three-year treatment periods, runoff was measured in 0.91- and 1.37-m H-flumes with bubbler flow meters. Composite samples were analyzed for sediment, total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate, and ammonium. Calibration equations developed to predict runoff, sediment, and nutrients losses explained 66 to 97% of the variability between treatment watersheds. The contour strip and agroforestry treatments reduced runoff by 10 and 1% during the treatment period. In both treatments, most runoff reductions occurred in the second and third years after treatment establishment. The contour strip treatment reduced erosion by 19% in 1999, while erosion in the agroforestry treatment exceeded the predicted loss. Treatments reduced TP loss by 8 and 17% on contour strip and agroforestry watersheds. Treatments did not result in reductions in TN during the first two years of the treatment period. The contour strip and agroforestry treatments reduced TN loss by 21 and 20%, respectively, during a large precipitation event in the third year. During the third year of treatments, nitrate N loss was reduced 24 and 37% by contour strip and agroforestry treatments.

Riparian buffer strips are considered an effective means of attenuating concentrated nitrates in agricultural runoff. Whilst a large number of scientific investigations have focused on nitrate removal mechanisms, such as plant uptake and denitrification maximization in buffer zones, few have studied the effects that different soil management treatments have on drainage rates. The application of chloride tracer to soils under six different vegetative treatments from two differing soil textures produced breakthrough curves highlighting the dominant flow mechanisms for each management practice. Of the 18 breakthrough tracers determined, 9 exhibited a rapid macropore hydrology, 6 intermediate mesopore through-flow and three slow micropore flow. Solute breakthrough flow rate was significant between all vegetation and soil treatments (P< 0.05), indicating that both play an important role in the determination of drainage flow pathways and transport speed. Vegetation such as scrub, with a large root network, led to increased soil porosity, significantly increasing the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the maximum peak drainage rates of the soil. On the other hand, maize and grass treatments, with smaller and less dense root networks, exhibited lower soil porosity and hydraulic conductivity, increasing solute residence time within the soil matrix and hence a longer lag time to peak effluent concentration. Although many of the treatments on each soil texture were different, and so could not be directly compared, results suggested that optimal treatments were soil specific, but that grassed and maize buffer strips, on a soil with low saturated hydraulic conductivity, would provide the best compromise at mitigating solute drainage whilst maintaining management practicality.",0

In terms of additional crop production, a three-row mixed windbreak with extensive management and low cost is the most cost effective because it requires the smallest corn yield increases to break even. Using a sheltering effect of 12 windbreak heights, the required additional yield is 0.28 Mg ha""1 yr""1. A four-row spruce windbreak with intensive management and high costs is the least cost effective because it requires the largest corn yield increases that are 28 times larger than those of the mixed windbreak. Trees that grow faster and taller are more cost effective because they provide sheltering effect sooner and over larger distances allowing to break even with smaller yield increases that are more likely to be achieved. In terms of carbon sequestration, a four-row cottonwood windbreak is the most cost effective because it accumulates the greatest amounts of above and below-ground carbon that allow it to break even with a lifespan as short as 30 years. Only a cottonwood windbreak accumulates enough carbon to break even at a comparison price of $10.48 Mg""1. A higher carbon price of $32.38 Mg""1 enables a mixed windbreak to break even. Spruce windbreaks (two and four rows) require higher prices to break even.

The long-term efficiency of forest reclamation and crop-growing technologies developed in the 1950s by the Dokuchaev Soil Science Institute and the Institute of Forest to reclaim strongly saline solonetzic soils was proved. In 55 years, strongly saline sodic solonetzes with sulfate-chloride and chloride-sulfate composition of salts were replaced by agrogenic soils with new properties. Under forest shelterbelts, where deep (40–60 cm) plowing was performed, the soils were transformed into slightly saline solonetzic agrozems with slight soda salinization in the upper meter and with dealkalized plowed and turbated horizons (0–20(40) cm). Under the adjacent cropland subjected to the influence of the shelterbelts on the soil water regime, strongly saline solonetzes were transformed into solonchakous agrosolonetzes with slight soda salinization in the upper 50 cm. In the plow layer, the content of exchangeable sodium decreased to 4–12% of the sum of exchangeable cations.

Hydrologic simulation models assist in predicting the effects of buffers on runoff and sediment losses from small watersheds. The objective of this study was to calibrate, validate and simulate runoff and sediment losses and compare buffer effects on NPSP losses relative to control watersheds (no buffer) for seven years. The experimental design consists of four watersheds under pasture management which were monitored from 2002 through 2008; two with agroforestry buffers (AgB 100 and AgB 300) and two control watersheds (CW 400 and CW 600). Pasture areas included red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) and lespedeza (Kummerowia stipulacea Maxim.) planted into fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) while the agroforestry buffer area included Eastern cottonwood trees (Populus deltoids Bortr. ex Marsh.) planted into fescue. The APEX model was calibrated from 2002 to 2005 and was validated from 2006 to 2008. The r2 and NSE values for the calibration and validation periods of the runoff varied from 0.52 to 0.78 and 0.50 to 0.74, respectively. The model did not predict sediment loss very well probably due to insufficient number of measured events and low measured sediment loss. The measured runoff was 57% higher for CW watersheds compared to AgB watersheds. The measured sediment loss was 95% higher for CW watersheds compared to AgB watersheds. After calibrating and validating the model, it was run for long-term scenario analyses for 10 years from 1999 to 2008. Simulated buffer width had a significant influence on runoff. Simulated runoff decreased by 24% when the buffer width was doubled compared to losses associated with the measured buffer width. Simulated runoff from the CW watersheds was 11% higher with double stocking density (relative to measured density) compared to AgB watersheds with double stocking density.

Appropriate agroecosystems management may favour this type of indirect interaction. In that context, our aim was to test the effect of rose bush [Rosa rugosa (Thunb.)] strips on the building up of aphid populations and of their natural enemies in adjacent cereal habitats. Several aphid species are currently found on Rosa sp. including Metopolophium dirhodum (Walker) for which it is a primary host. Aphid predators and parasitoids may build their populations on the aphid population present on Rosa sp. and later on migrate to wheat field during the cereal aphid infestation. Moreover, the flowers of the rose bushes may provide a source of nectar and pollen to these natural enemies. Our experiment was conducted in three rose margin wheat plots with a strip of rose bushes of R. rugosa and three control plots. Plots were compared during 2 years (2003 and 2004). Aphid, parasitoid and predator densities were recorded from May to the harvest of wheat on rose bushes and in wheat. In 2003, the aphid densities were moderate but in 2004, the population of aphid was very high. Even if predator and parasitoids arrived earlier in rose margin field than in control ones, the presence of rose bushes did not influence the aphid population within the field. Metopolophium dirhodum did not seem to migrate from the rose bushes to wheat. The level of parasitism was weak in rose bushes and the natural enemy population was not different in rose margin wheat and in control plots. The causes of the lack of efficiency of this type of management are discussed as well as the high aphid population in wheat in 2004.",0

Agriculture, urbanization or forestry in river catchments can influence river organisms through diffuse effects on hydrology and hydrochemistry, or local effects on habitat character, bank erosion and sediment delivery. Riparian buffer zones are sometimes established to mitigate undesirable effects on salmonids, but consequences for organisms such as macroinvertebrates are less well known.

2.
Riparian fencing and tree coppicing were carried out on upland tributaries of the Welsh River Wye (UK) from 1997 onwards with the aim of enhancing conditions for salmonid fish. The present study used routine, agency monitoring data to compare assemblages in three recently managed streams and five adjacent control streams. Data between 1995 and 2004 were used to assess treatment effects through time.

3.
Post-treatment (2000–2004) assemblages were richer in recently managed streams than in controls, mostly due to apparent gains of taxa typical of channel margins and lowland, warmer conditions. However, results were equivocal because invertebrate families typical of lowland, more eutrophic conditions increased in occurrence in all reaches irrespective of treatment, while overall richness declined.

4.
This study illustrates how routine monitoring data can reveal some effects of riparian land-use and management on stream biota. However, improved experimental design, ideally using a before–after control–intervention approach, would have allowed more effective assessment in this case study where confounding trends were so marked. We advocate using such approaches in future restoration studies to allow stronger inference and greater statistical power. The recent general decline in the richness of typical headwater organisms in the Wye system requires investigation. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0

In 2000 the Commonwealth of Virginia, USA, began an extensive cooperative venture under the Chesapeake Bay Initiative to establish riparian buffers on agricultural lands, primarily through United States Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). Prior to CREP implementation, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) developed a regionally tailored fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for use as a watershed assessment technique in Northern Virginia. Using this regional IBI framework, we evaluated the effects of recently established riparian buffers on aquatic condition. Within the geographic scope of the regional IBI, we evaluated all buffer segments planned between 2000 and 2003. Cumulatively during this period, we assessed stream physical condition on 36 buffer sites and 12 reference sites using the NRCS Stream Visual Assessment Protocol (SVAP); we also assessed the aquatic community at these sites using the IBI. Improvements in stream condition were clearly demonstrated at certain sites within one year of buffer establishment. Although not all buffer projects responded with positive trends, mean SVAP and IBI scores for buffered sites increased over the course of the study, whereas the trend on reference sites was level or slightly downward. We observed positive IBI response at sites with highly disturbed local conditions prior to buffer establishment combined with small, relatively undisturbed watersheds above. Simple solutions such as buffer establishment alone cannot be expected to protect streams from adverse human impacts that occur at a broader scale. Therefore, riparian restoration should be planned and carried out in concert with other conservation practices at a watershed scale in a way that maximizes buffer effectiveness.",0

Six of the sites received agricultural runoff directly via culverts and drainage ditches (non-buffered sites) and six sites were protected from agricultural runoff by a vegetated buffer (buffered sites). Mean total number of aquatic macroinvertebrates were significantly greater (p <0.001) for buffered sites (230 ± 44 standard error) than non-buffered sites (97 ± 24). Water from non-buffered sites had significantly greater turbidity, conductivity, and concentrations of chlorophyll α and atrazine than buffered sites in addition to consistently greater annual averages of total nitrogen and total phosphorus. Furthermore, sediments from non-buffered sites had significantly greater cadmium, potassium, sodium and zinc than buffered sites.

We also investigated the effect of habitat (field centre vs edge), and of season and year. This was done at the individual level using radio-tracking, and at the population level using live-trapping. Wood mouse population size (estimated as minimum number alive) was significantly affected by season. Wood mouse numbers also differed between crop types. Rape field centres and edges had significantly lower numbers than did barley or wheat field centres and edges. Populations were largest from April to July, when the crop was tall. In winter, significantly more mice were found in field edges compared with field centres. The patterns of movement of individual mice also showed differences between habitats and between seasons. Mice were found to move more quickly when they were tracked through rape compared with the other crops. When the crop was growing, they moved faster through field edges bordered with hedgerow than they did through wood. This pattern was reversed later in the year when the crop was tall. The distances moved during a session of tracking showed differences which paralleled those for speed of movement. Also, males tended to move faster than females. Differences between the sexes in movement patterns were affected by season; when the crop was down (in winter) females moved further than males during a session of tracking, but when the crop was growing and tall, this was reversed.",0

After 3 months, the glomeromycotan communities in the roots of these trap plants were analysed using 454 pyrosequencing of a fragment of the RNA polymerase II gene (RPB1). Intraspecific populations of R. irregularis were studied by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mtLSU) gene. Soil disturbance significantly increased the diversity of species-level molecular taxa (MTs) and altered community structure, whilst fertilisation alone had no significant effect, unless coupled with ploughing. At the population level, the expected shift from genotypes of R. irregularis typically found in grasslands to those usually found in arable sites was only partially observed. In conclusion, in the short-term, physical soil disturbance, as well as nitrogen fertilisation when coupled with physical soil disturbance, affected AMF community and to a smaller extent population composition.",0

Hedgerows are linear features that can vary substantially in structure and quality. Having surveyed 180 hedgerows, in four locations, and sampled their small mammal communities we examined the effect of physical hedgerow attributes on the abundance of small mammal species. Using three elements of landscape structure, we explored whether variation was best explained by the Random Sample Hypothesis (that small islands represent a random sample of those species populating larger areas), or by the Fragmentation Hypothesis (that species abundance will decrease with a loss of habitat area). We tested the relationship between the relative abundance of small mammals and 1. hedgerow connectivity; 2. total habitat availability and 3. local habitat complexity. We then explored the predictive power of combinations of these habitat variables. Connectivity was a positive predictor of wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus, and hedgerow gappiness was a negative predictor of bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus. The total amount of habitat available (hedgerow width, height and length) was a positive indicator of total small mammal biomass. These results support the Fragmentation Hypothesis that species abundance and distribution decrease with a loss of habitat area. The preservation of linear and associated habitats may therefore be important in maintaining metapopulations of the species we studied.",0

Phytophagous species, especially the Psyllidae and the larvae of Lepidoptera and Tenthredinidae were significantly more abundant on the remnant hedges.



The cut hedges had a greater number of taxa than the other two types but the most obvious difference between them was the high number of Psyllidae on the remnant hedges.



The cut hedges had the highest faunal diversity and the ranking of the hedge types was the same for the three diversity indices used. The way hedge management could affect the arthropod fauna is discussed.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of riparian buffers on instream habitat, fish assemblage structure, and population characteristics (i.e., the growth of two small-bodied species) in three streams in central Iowa.

Anderson.Vita.Ph. D. University of Missouri--Columbia 2010.The U.S. Department of Agriculture initiated the Conservation Effects Assessment Project in 2003 to quantify water quality and wildlife benefits of conservation programs funded by the 2002 Farm Security and Rural Investment Act. This study examined the effects of agricultural best management practices (BMPs) implemented in the Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW) and investigated strategies to target future BMPs. Evaluation of storm events between 1993 and 2006 showed no significant BMP effects on dissolved atrazine and NO3�-N losses after 14% of the GCEW had been affected by BMP establishment. Approximately 20 and 4 years of monitoring will be needed before a statistically significant ([alpha]=0.05) 25% reduction in mean dissolved atrazine and nitrate-N can be demonstrated at the GCEW outlet, respectively. A widely used hydrologic model, SWAT, identified fields adjacent to streams with lesser depths to the argillic horizon as the highest risk for atrazine and NO3�-N pollutant loss. Twenty two percent and 34% of cropped fields in the GCEW required establishment of vegetative filter strips to reduce dissolved atrazine and NO3�-N loads by 25% at the GCEW based on SWAT predictions. A 99% accurate method to quantify soil redoximorphic features (SRFs) was developed using a digital camera and image classification software. Correlation between quantified SRFs and the topographic wetness index was found for one of two GCEW fields, indicating field soil surveys may serve as relatively quick reconnaissance methods to identify sensitive field areas.Includes bibliographical reference",0

However, effectiveness of targeted conservation actions across broader landscapes is poorly understood. We evaluated multiregion, multispecies avian densities on row-crop fields with native grass field margins (i.e., buffers) as part of the first U.S. agricultural conservation practice designed to support habitat and population recovery objectives of a national wildlife conservation initiative. We coordinated breeding season point transect surveys for 6 grassland bird species on 1151 row-crop fields with and without native grass buffers (9-37 m) in 14 U.S. states (10 ecoregions) from 2006 to 2011. In most regions, breeding season densities of 5 of 6 targeted bird species were greater in the 500-m surrounding survey points centered on fields with native grass buffers than in landscapes without buffers. Relative effect sizes were greatest for Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), Dickcissel (Spiza americana), and Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla) in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley and Eastern Tallgrass Prairie regions. Other species (e.g., Eastern Meadowlark [Sturnella magna], Grasshopper Sparrow [Ammodramus savannarum]) exhibited inconsistent relative effect sizes. Bird densities on fields with and without buffers were greatest in the Central Mixed-grass Prairie region. Our results suggest that strategic use of conservation buffers in regions with the greatest potential for relative density increases in target species will elicit greater range-wide population response than diffuse, uninformed, and broadly distributed implementation of buffers. We recommend integrating multiple conservation practices in broader agricultural landscapes to maximize conservation effectiveness for a larger suite of species.",1

The objective of this study was to investigate the impacts of riparian land management on gully erosion. A field survey documented the number of gullies and cattle access points in riparian forest buffers, grass filters, annual row-cropped fields, pastures in which the cattle were fenced out of the stream, and continuously, rotationally and intensive rotationally grazed pastures in three regions of Iowa. Gully lengths, depths and severely eroding bank areas were measured. Gullies exhibited few significant differences among riparian management practices. The most significant differences were exhibited between conservation and agricultural management practices, an indication that conservation practices could reduce gully erosion. Changes in pasture management from continuous to rotational or intensive rotational grazing showed no reductions in gully erosion. It is important to recognize that more significant differences among riparian management practices were not exhibited because the conservation and alternative grazing practices had recently been established. As gully formation is more impacted by upland than riparian management, gully stabilization might require additional upland conservation practices. The existence of numerous cattle access points in pastures where cattle have full access to the stream also indicates that these could be substantial sources of sediment for streams. Finally, the gully banks were less important sediment contributors to streams than the streambanks. The severely eroding bank areas in streams were six times greater than those in the gullies in the monitored reaches.",0

In addition to beneficial insects, many herbivores depend on floral food as well. The indiscriminate use of flowering species in field margins can therefore lead to higher pest numbers. Based on results from field observations and laboratory experiments we assessed risks as well as benefits associated with the provision of nectar plants in field margins, using Brussels sprouts as a model system. Results show that Brussels sprouts bordered by nectar plants suitable for the cabbage white Pieris rapae L., suffered higher infestation levels by this herbivore. In contrast, nectar plants providing accessible nectar for the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella L., did not raise densities of P. xylostella larvae in the Brassica crop. Margins with Anethum graveolens L., selected on the basis of its suitability as nectar plant for parasitoids, significantly increased the number of adult Diadegma semiclausum Hellen in the crop. This didn’t translate into enhanced parasitism rates, as parasitism of P. xylostella by D. semiclausum exceeded 65 % in all treatments, irrespective of the plants in the field margin. Our findings emphasize the importance of taking a multitrophic approach when choosing flowering field margin plants for biocontrol or other ecosystem services.",0

Soil organic matter (SOM), and especially biologically-active soil organic matter, is considered to be an important soil quality indicator variable because of it has relationship to critical soil functions like erodibility and the capacity of the soil to act as an environmental buffer. The objectives of this study were to examine trends in SOM C accrual and to quantify intra-seasonal changes in SOM C and particulate organic matter (POM) C for each vegetation zone of a MRBS seven years after establishment on previously cultivated or heavily grazed soil. Total SOM C and POM C in soil under perennial vegetation (poplar, switch- grass and cool season grass) were significantly higher than under cropped soil. Total POM C changed within vegetation type over the four month study period, whereas total SOM C did not. After six growing seasons, SOM C increased 8.5% under poplar grown in association with cool season grass, and 8.6% under switchgrass. The results are very promising and suggest that changes in SOM C can occur in a relatively short time after the establishment of perennial vegetation in a MRB. These changes should increase the ability of MRB soil to process non- point source pollutants.",0

The UK Government's Public Service Agreement target seeks to reverse the decline of farmland birds in England by 2020 through the use of AES. The Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) scheme, introduced in 2005, is the first non-competitive, broad-uptake stewardship scheme designed to deliver simple but effective environmental management on farms throughout England. Approximately 5 million hectares of farmland are currently entered into Environmental Stewardship (ES) agreements, and given the scale of this investment it is important to verify the efficacy of ELS as a mechanism for delivering biodiversity benefits. We used spatially referenced ES agreement data to assess the influence of specific management options and combinations of options on farmland bird population changes between 2005 and 2008 derived from standardized surveys carried out on over 2000 lowland farmland 1-km squares in England. The results showed only limited evidence for short-term effects of ES. Only Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra and Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris showed some landscape-specific positive associations with area under ELS management. There was also limited evidence for positive associations between specific management options and the population changes of the species at which they were aimed. The current pattern of option uptake may be limiting benefits of ELS, with boundary management accounting for over 50% of scheme compensation value. However, the time required for option maturation and the time lags in bird population responses to environmental change mean that it is too early to reach definitive conclusions about the success or failure of the scheme. The findings of this study will assist in the development of ELS by feeding into the 5-year review scheduled for 2010 and have implications for the development of similar schemes elsewhere in Europe.",0

The variation in taxonomic composition, community attributes and trophic structure of fish assemblages from streams under different riparian zone preservation conditions were studied. Nine stream reaches under the following riparian vegetation conditions were selected: Native Forest (NF), with mostly primary forest; Secondary Forest (SF), which included sites with vegetation in an advanced stage of regeneration surrounded by sugarcane plantations; and Sugarcane sites (SC), located in areas without riparian vegetation, adjacent to sugarcane crops. Forty-one species were collected. The variance partitioning and partial Redundancy Analysis (pRDA) indicated that community composition and trophic structure were significantly explained by riparian condition and spatial variations, while diversity, richness, abundance and biomass were only explained by season and space, with higher diversity and richness at the SF sites. Abundance-Biomass curves (ABC curves) suggested that sugarcane plantations destabilized fish assemblages, especially at the more intensively managed sites, which seem to influence stream integrity and associated fish fauna. We concluded that both physical conditions of streams and some attributes of fish communities reflected the different levels of preservation of the riparian buffers, but given the influence of regional processes which have a pervasive role in shaping local assemblages, land use at the watershed scale seemed to be important especially to explain the higher richness and diversity found at the SF sites.",0

Longer-tongued Bombus species preferred the perennial mixtures in which Trifolium pratense was dominant, whilst shorter-tongued Bombus and honeybees, Apis mellifera, visited mainly Borago officinalis in the annual mix. These patterns were supported by analysis of pollen loads from B. pascuorum and B. terrestris, both species showing a high degree of flower constancy to sown species.

The main aims of this study were (i) to investigate how four hedge stand types, i.e., systems of management distinguished on the basis of the natural and managed growth forms of trees and shrubs (low single-storied, high single-storied, two-storied and multi-storied), differ in their biometric parameters and (ii) to identify the primary management-related determinants of native woody species richness. The study used a large dataset of hedgerows (n=538) sampled in seven sites in Northern Italy. The four hedge stand types exhibited highly significant differences in size and biometric parameters. The multi-storied hedges, associated with the highest stand structural diversity index values, supported the highest number of tree species, followed by high single-storied hedges. The low single-storied hedge stand type contained the lowest number of species. We found a positive effect of hedge area as well as a marginal negative effect of basal area on native woody species richness. The management implications addressed by our study include conversion of single-storied into two- or multi-storied types, increasing hedge size and controlling hedge stand basal area.",0

A two-phase study was conducted in southern Illinois that examined the ability of various riparian buffer species to attenuate fecal coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli (E. coli) in overland flow, while also assessing E. coli persistence in associated buffer soils. Plots established with giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea (Walt.) Muhl.), Kentucky Bluegrass (Poa pratensis), Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), and non-vegetated control buffers were subjected to artificial flooding with cattle (Bos taurus) manure-laden water. Mean bacteria concentrations in overland flow exiting all plots were significantly higher than concentrations found in the source slurry. To assess E. coli persistence in plots, overland flow was collected from a simulated rainfall event 4 days following slurry application, and from natural rainfall events 22, 46, 94, 97, and 111 days after the application. Overland flow exiting all plots (including non-vegetated controls) exhibited mean E. coli concentrations significantly higher than those found in the initial slurry applied. The observed concentrations may have been the result of overland flow characteristics and high levels of ambient fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) present with plots. The moist, shaded conditions created by plot vegetation may have produced prime habitat to harbor FIB. Vegetated buffer strips (VBS) may have been effective at attenuating FIB, however, performance may have been masked by the exceptionally high ambient FIB populations that were present in adjacent soils. The young age of the VBS (<1 year) may have also influenced their seemingly poor FIB attenuation. As the VBS age, increases in above and below ground vegetative material may act to increase VBS attenuation capabilities.",0

The microbes, applied within dairy‐farm effluent, were washed into the strips by surface runoff generated at rates of 4–13 litres/min using a water sprinkler system. The effluent and surface and subsurface outflows at the lower end of each plot were sampled for microbial analysis. Flow rate influenced the timing of peak microbial concentration in outflow and the recovery of both microbes. Under high flow, recovery rates varied from 15–100%, and hence entrapment was often minimal. Under the slowest rate of water application, entrapment was much greater (≥95%), at least over the 40 min of water application. During large runoff events, and where preferential flowpaths occur, buffer strips need to exceed 5 m in length in order to markedly reduce the delivery of faecal microbes to waterways.

The species number and density of most predator groups increased from year to year. The succession (parallel to the development of the unmown strips) favoured more specialized species, so that the initial pioneer species become less abundant in consecutive years. In spiders, this succession leads from a dominance of Linyphiidae to a dominance of Lycosidae; the spider biomass increases and probably predator pressure by spiders is augmented. The stability of the predator community (measured as the variance of their frequency in successive years) is higher than that of the phytophagous groups. Under strip-managed conditions the abundance (""activity density"") of most arthropod groups decreases by an average of ca. 12%. The trophic levels, however, are affected to different extents and strong species-specific preferences were found as well. These combined effects lead to constant increase in the ratio of predacious and parasitic to phytophagous insects in the strip-managed area and probably lead also to an increase of the predator pressure facing phytophagous insects. Strip-management is discussed as an important technique among integrated methods for the biological control of pests.",2

Significantly higher recapture rates, indicating higher activity, were found in the strip-managed area than in the control area, especially in Poecilus cupreus and also in Carabus granulatus and Pterostichus melanarius. Several observations led to the conclusion that this higher activity is generally due to a prolongation of the reproductive period in the strip-managed area. Significantly higher activity densities were found for P. cupreus, Pterostichus anthracinus, C. granulatus and Pt. melanarius in the strip-managed area than in a bordering control area. P. cupreus is greatly attracted to the strips during its migrations, as can be deduced from the high percentage of movements that contact the strips. Also, significantly more marked individuals moved from the control to the strip-managed area than vice versa. Pt. melanarius and Pt. anthracinus show less preference for the strips in their movements than P. cupreus. However, significantly more individuals of Pt. melanarius also moved from the control to the strip-managed area. C. granulatus, on the other hand, kept mainly to the cereal areas. After harvest only Pterostichus niger and Harpalus rufipes distinctly preferred the strips. The generally marked degree of attraction exercised by strip-management on carabid beetles is discussed.",2

Grassed waterways are natural or constructed channels that have been shaped to transport water at nonerosive velocities from agricultural fields. When properly designed and maintained, grassed waterways do not have standing water. Geographic location and erosion potential determine the grass species planted in the channel, but generally, cool-season grasses are used because of their quick establishment and even, dense growth (USSCS 1975). Waterways also were promoted for their benefits to wildlife (USSCS 1972). High densities of nesting birds have been found in linear agricultural habitats such as fencerows, roadside ditches, and terraces (e.g., Dow 1969, Basore et al. 1986). This response also may occur in waterways. Because many fencerows have been removed (Vance 1976), grassed waterways may become more important wildlife habitat in agricultural areas. High nest density, however, is not necessarily synonymous with high reproductive output (Gates and Gysel 1978). Disturbance from farming practices can decrease nesting success below the level necessary to sustain populations (Rodenhouse and Best 1983, Frawley 1989). Development of management guidelines for grassed waterways is important, especially with the passage of the 1985 and 1990 farm bills. Both bills required landowners to implement a conservation plan if they were to continue farming annually tilled crops on highly erodible land. Conservation tillage, terracing, and grassed waterways could be used to meet this requirement (U.S. Dep. Agric. 1986). Our objectives were to (1) determine the species and nesting densities of birds in grassed waterways, (2) document nesting success in grassed waterways, and (3) assess the influence of waterway structure and vegetation on nest density and success.",0

However, the effect of field buffers on bird species during the non-breeding season is less understood. We compared density, avian richness, and avian conservation value on row-crop fields containing buffers strategically designed for wildlife versus fields without buffers in 3 southeastern U.S. states during winter 2007 and 2008. Fields with buffers were enrolled in U.S. Department of Agriculture, Conservation Reserve Program practice Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds (CP33), which targets restoration of northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and other upland bird species. Overall species richness did not differ on fields with buffers versus fields without buffers in 2007, but was 29% greater on fields with buffers in 2008. Swamp sparrows (Melospiza georgiana), song sparrows (M. melodia), field sparrows (Spizella pusilla), and red-bellied woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus) had greater densities on fields with buffers compared with fields without buffers. Increasing field-buffer width did not result in greater bird densities. Our results suggest a small change in primary land use (≈7%) produced a disproportionate population response by some grassland-dependent and woodland bird species during winter. Because field buffers provide a direct source of winter food and cover resources, they may be a pragmatic means to provide critical non-breeding habitat with little alteration of existing agricultural systems. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.",0

Similar use of strata occasionally occurred between bird species, but similarities in use of plantings were not found. The majority (60.7%) of the bird species was most often sighted in the ground stratum. Genera of plantings preferred by the avian community included Picea, Populus, Acer, Lonicera, and Ulmus. Bird species best adapted to shelterbelts appeared to be generalists in strata and planting use. Inclusion of the 5 preferred genera of trees and shrubs in new shelterbelts or in old shelterbelts in need of renovation would benefit a variety of bird species in intensively farmed regions. This management practice would increase vegetative complexity in a vertical dimension, enabling coexisting bird species to partition space more effectively in these spatially restricted habitats. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 46(1):50-60 Farmstead shelterbelts are planted primarily to provide year-round protection to humans, domestic animals, homes, and buildings from the effects of high winds, windchills, and snowdrifts, thereby reducing costs of fuel, feed, maintenance, and labor associated with farm operations (Smith and Scholten 1980). These manmade habitats are also important to many bird species that depend on woody habitats as sources of food and cover in intensively farmed regions (Orendurff 1941, Martin 1978). As a consequence of larger farms, increased mechanization, planting of extensive fields in fewer types of crops (principally corn and soybeans), and other recent agricultural trends, farmstead shelterbelts and other wooded habitats often comprise only 3% or less of the total area (Griffith 1976). Moreover, farmstead shelterbelts are generally less than 1 ha in size, and vegetative composition may vary considerably among shelterbelts because landowners can select from a variety of d ciduous and coniferous trees and shrubs when planting new or renovating existing shelterbelts (Smith and Scholten 1980). Thus, an understanding of the m nner by which avian species exploit space in these spatially restricted, manmade habitats is essential for the proper management of birds in the Great Plains",0

Among the specific objectives of the project, there was the determination of change in the composition of the microbial populations of soil of the wooded riparian strip. The composition of the bacterial communities collected at different depths inside and outside the riparian strip was determined by combined approaches involving cultivation (CFU), microscopic approaches (CTC test), and DNA-based techniques (ARDRA and DGGE). The size of the living population was the same inside and outside the experimental strip, with a minor percentage of culturable bacteria. Higher numbers of metabolically active bacteria and higher bacterial diversity were detected in the internal soil, with deeper soil layers showing reduced diversity, thus indicating that soil management within the riparian strip effectively supports the viability of bacterial communities. Total operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and percentage of single OTUs were also found to be always higher in the internal soil samples for all soil layers, with the percentage of Firmicutes increasing and Actinobacteria decreasing with depth. The increasing soil organic carbon inputs due to the contribution of the growing plants were found to support bacterial diversity in all soil layers. DNA-based analysis also indicated a clear effect of the applied treatments on soil bacterial diversity and a well-defined separation of the bacterial communities related to the different soil layers of the riparian strip.",0

1. Understanding the mechanisms by which environmental change has impacted natural processes typically requires good time series for the environmental change. Unfortunately, other than for climate, detailed time series of historical environments are scarce. In many instances, researchers can only collate disparate and sometimes fragmented information from the literature or from historical or pre-historical sources.



2. Here, we apply modern statistical methods to reconstruct a recent historical time series of environmental change from sparse data collected from heterogeneous sources. Specifically, we deal with record irregularity and the varying levels of uncertainty associated with each datum using state-space models in a hierarchical Bayesian framework.



3. As an example, we reconstruct a time series of a simple landscape feature (hedgerow length) over a large spatial scale (Britain) over a long-time period (50 years), by combining both stock estimates and rate of change estimates, gathered from different historical sources.



4. We illustrate the utility of the method by relating the population trends of a hedgerow-nesting passerine bird, the yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella to the reconstructed trends in hedgerow length. Population density was closely related to hedgerow availability, suggesting a potential key role for nesting habitat loss in the yellowhammer decline.



5. The modelling framework we used is flexible and general. The method can be adapted to reconstruct time series of any environmental variables from a variety of sparse and heterogeneous historical sources.",0

This insect overwinters in the adult stage in litter in wooded areas such as shelterbelts. Historically, crop producers have been unsure of the merits of shelterbelts, especially if nearby crops are more likely to be infested by insect pests as a result. In this study, bean leaf beetle adults were sampled during the season by visually counting the number of beetles found on soybean plants early in the season and by sweep net sampling once plants were at the V4 stage (approximately 0.33 m tall). Sampling was done in 1997 and 1998 at the University of Nebraska Agricultural Research and Development Center in Saunders Co. in east-central Nebraska. Beetle counts were compared between shelterbelt-protected and -unprotected fields. In general. bean leaf beetles were more numerous in 1997 than in 1998, with abundance peaks occurring in late-July and early-September in both years. There were significant differences in bean leaf beetle counts from protected and unprotected fields on only three of the 11 and four of the 13 sampling dates in 1997 and 1998, respectively. On the sampling dates when significant differences were found, two of three in 1997 and three of four in 1998 had higher bean leaf beetle abundance in the protected soybean fields. The results of this study indicate a tendency for more bean leaf beetles in shelterbelt-protected soybean fields when differences are found, but beetle numbers were not significantly different between protected and unprotected fields on the majority of sample dates in the two years of this study. This study also reconfirms the presence of two generations of the bean leaf beetle in Nebraska.",0

Therefore, planting flowering plants and perennial grasses around farms may lead to better biological control of pests in nearby crops.",0

Semi-natural vegetation and diverse cropping systems have been converted into monocultures with low tree densities, leaving the soil unprotected. We evaluated the association in soil- and water-conservation systems with production in traditional almond orchards and the beneficial impact of plant strips in mountainous agriculture. Soil loss, runoff and nutrient loss over a four-year period (2002–2005) were monitored in hillside erosion plots with almond trees under different soil-management systems: (1) non-tillage with sage (Salvia lavandulifolia L. subspecies Oxyodon) strips 3 m wide; (2) non-tillage with rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) strips, (3) non-tillage with thyme (Thymus baeticus L. Boiss. exlacaita) strips, and (4) conventional tillage on the south flank of the Sierra Nevada (Lanjaron) in south-eastern Spain. Also, the nut yield from almond trees, and the biomass from aromatic-shrub strips were measured. The erosion plots, located on a 35% slope, were 144 m2 in area. The plant-cover strips, 3 m wide, ran across the slope. Our results show that the most effective treatment proved to be non-tillage with thyme strips, reducing the annual soil loss by 93% and runoff by 80%, with respect to conventional tillage. Non-tillage with rosemary strips reduced soil loss by 91 % and runoff by 82%, with respect to conventional tillage, while these percentages were 69% and 51%, respectively, for non-tillage with sage strips. In addition, all the treatments as a whole, in comparison with conventional tillage, revealed that the plant strips were the decisive factor in the reduction of NPK losses by surface runoff. The average nut yield from non-tillage with sage strips, non-tillage with rosemary strips, non-tillage with thyme strips and conventional tillage during the study period was 2.4, 3.2, 3.8 and 4.5 kg tree−1, respectively, and the essential oil yield from sage, rosemary and thyme strips was 5.0, 8.7 and 10.8 L ha−1, respectively. The non-tillage with thyme strips decreased nutrient loading in surface waters and thus had a positive impact on the environment while simultaneously maintaining reasonable almond-production levels. Thus, the combination of orchard trees with shrubs provided a viable option to conserve soil and water in hilly areas with opportunities to increase overall land productivity as well as sustainable agro-environmental measures.",0

The afforestation of these riparian zones has the potential to increase carbon (C) storage in agricultural landscapes by creating a new biomass sink for atmospheric CO2. Occurring at the same time, the storage of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in plant biomass, is an important water quality function that may greatly vary with types of riparian vegetation. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare C, N and P storage in aboveground, belowground and detrital biomass for three types of riparian vegetation cover (9-year-old hybrid poplar buffers, herbaceous buffers and natural woodlots) across four agricultural sites and (2) to determine potential vegetation cover effects on soil nutrient supply rate in the riparian zone. Site level comparisons suggest that 9-year-old poplar buffers have stored 9e31 times more biomass C, 4e10 times more biomass N, and 3e7 times more biomass P than adjacent non managed herbaceous buffers, with the largest differences observed on the more fertile sites. The conversion of these herbaceous buffers to poplar buffers could respectively increase C, N and P storage in biomass by 3.2e11.9 t/ha/yr, 32e124 kg/ ha/yr and 3.2e15.6 kg/ha/yr, over 9 years. Soil NO3 and P supply rates during the summer were respectively 57% and 66% lower in poplar buffers than in adjacent herbaceous buffers, potentially reflecting differences in nutrient storage and cycling between the two buffer types. Biomass C ranged 49 e160 t/ha in woodlots, 33e110 t/ha in poplar buffers and 3e4 t/ha in herbaceous buffers. Similar biomass C stocks were found in the most productive poplar buffer and three of the four woodlots studied. Given their large and varied biomass C stocks, conservation of older riparian woodlots is equally important for C balance management in farmland. In addition, the establishment of poplar buffers, in replacement of non managed herbaceous buffers, could rapidly increase biomass C, N and P storage along farm streams, which would be beneficial for water quality protection and global change mitigation. © 2015 The Authors.

An opportunity for innovation is offered by the growing success of chip-fed boilers, since the production of chips is simpler than that of logs and has a higher potential for cost reduction. Within this context, a study was conducted in Italy with the goals of: (a) designing three alternative chip harvesting methods for buffer strips, (b) field-testing the performance of each alternative, and (c) developing a model for estimating the cost of these methods under varying operational and economic conditions. The three harvesting methods reflected different mechanization levels, with escalating investment requirements. Overall, the study demonstrated that frequent maintenance of young, single row buffer strips generates profits only when thoroughly mechanized. Using a dedicated feller-buncher, a front-end loader for extraction and an industrial truck-mounted chipper brought the delivered cost below the 14 €/m3 loose chips (approximately 4 €/GJ) presently paid by the district heating stations. However, the intermediate-mechanization system showed the highest potential for improvements. The␣study generated a spreadsheet-based model for predicting the effects of varying work conditions and cost hypotheses.",1

The seven-year-old multispecies buffers were composed of poplar (Populus×euroamericana ‘Eugenei’) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.). The cool-season grass buffers were dominated by non-native forage grasses (Bromus inermis Leysser., Phleum pratense L. and Poa pratensis L). Crop fields were under an annual corn-soybean rotation. Aboveground non-woody live and dead biomass were determined by direct harvests throughout two growing seasons. The dynamics of fine (0–2 mm) and small roots (2–5 mm) were assessed by sequentially collecting 35 cm deep, 5.4 cm diameter cores (125 cm deep cores in the second year) from April through November. Biomass of poplar trees was estimated using allometric equations developed by destructive sampling of trees. Poplar had the greatest aboveground live biomass, N and C pools, while switchgrass had the highest mean aboveground dead biomass, C and N pools. Over the two-year sampling period, live fine root biomass and root C and N in the riparian buffers were significantly greater than in crop fields. Growing-season mean biomass, C and N pools were greater in the multispecies buffer than in either of the crop fields or cool-season grass buffers. Rates of C accumulation in plant and litter biomass in the planted poplar and switchgrass stands averaged 2960 and 820 kg C ha−1 y−1, respectively. Nitrogen immobilization rates in the poplar stands and switchgrass sites averaged 37 and 16 kg N ha−1 y−1, respectively. Planted riparian buffers containing native perennial species therefore have the potential to sequester C from the atmosphere, and to immobilize N in biomass, therefore slowing or preventing N losses to the atmosphere and to ground and surface waters.",0

We documented bird species composition and relative abundance during the breeding season in 44 grassed waterways in central Iowa. The waterways were planted predominately to smooth brome (Bromus inermis) and were in cornfields and soybean fields. Forty-eight bird species were observed in waterways, compared with only 14 in the surrounding crop fields. Red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), dickcissels (Spiza americana), barn swallows (Hirundo rustica), western meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta), brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) were the most abundant bird species in the grassed waterways. Total bird abundance in the grassed waterways averaged 2198 birds observed/census/100 ha compared with 682 in crop fields. Temporal patterns in bird abundance were attributed primarily to aspects of the waterways and surrounding cropland that changed over time, such as vegetation height. Because most (53%) of the bird species were at peak abundance in the waterways during 4-22 July, grassed waterways should not be mowed until the end of August or early",0

Both experiment stations were intensively managed for agricultural row crop and dairy production with field edges managed with frequent mowing and herbicide application. Habitat reclamation and management on 41 ha of field edges was initiated on each farm in 1988 and included selective spraying herbicides to control agronomic grasses, cessation of annual mowing, protec- tion from livestock access, and planting legumes and shrubs. We surveyed birds from 1 May through 15 June on permanently established, fixed-width transects in three conservation buffer and three mowed field edges adjacent to row crops on each experimental farm from 1989 through 2001. We de - tected 25 bird species on mowed field edges and 51 species on edges maintained in conservation buffers on both farms. Mean species richness and bird abundance were higher (P < 0.05) on conservation buffers than on mowed field edges on both farms. We attributed higher bird species richness and abundance in conservation buffers to a more diverse habitat structure and increased food plant availability created by native plant succession and shrub plantings. These results support the concept that creation and maintenance of conservation buffers in field edges along row crops can increase bird spe - cies richness and abundance on agricultural lands.",0

Roughly 16,000 ha of filter strips have been established in Maryland through the United States Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program. Filter strips often represent the only uncultivated herbaceous areas on farmland in Maryland and therefore may be important habitat for early-successional bird species. Most filter strips in Maryland are planted to either native warm-season grasses or cool-season grasses and range in width from 10.7 m to 91.4 m. From 2004 to 2007 we studied the breeding and wintering bird communities in filter strips adjacent to wooded edges and non-buffered field edges and the effect that grass type and width of filter strips had on bird community composition.

Bird species richness, abundance, and diversity were calculated for 6 management situations-forest edge, forest edge with a rose hedgerow, tall fescue waterway, rose hedgerow waterway, rose hedgerow with an unmowed tall fescue strip, and rose hedgerow with a mowed fescue strip. The hedgerow-forest edges had higher bird species richness, abundance, and diversity than the open forest edges. Differences between sites were greatest in winter and early spring. In late spring/summer, several mixed habitat or edge bird species were detected in the hedgerow-forest edges that were absent or seldom observed in the open forest edges. The addition of edge species was also responsible for the fall, winter, and early spring differences. Avian use of the tall fescue waterways was low in all seasons and much lower than the rose hedgerow waterways. Avian use of rose hedgerows with grass borders was not greatly affected by mowing the 7-9-m wide tall fescue border. Wintering birds concentrated in rose hedgerows apparently as a result of the lack of dense shrub cover in other habitats. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 46(4):933-944 Strips of Japanese multiflora rose and tall (Kentucky 31) fescue were planted on Remington Farms in the late 1950's, most extensively along roads.

Enhancement of wildlife habitat, while identified as a function of such systems, has often been of secondary importance to soil conservation and water quality objectives. Though greatly important, little consideration has been given to how specific species will respond to the design and management of riparian buffers or other conservation lands. This study compared avian communities within a chronosequence of riparian buffers established on previously cropped or pastured land with those of the nearby matrix land cover types (row crop fields and an intensively grazed pasture). The riparian buffers consisted of native grasses, forbs, and woody vegetation established at three different times (2, 9, and 14+ years prior to survey). At each site, 10 min point counts for breeding birds were conducted using 50 m fixed radius plots, which were visited eight times between May 15 and July 10, 2008. A total of 54 bird species were observed over all of the study sites. The re-established riparian buffers in this study had higher bird abundance, richness, and diversity than the crop and pasture sites. These results suggest that re-establishing native riparian vegetation in areas of intensive agriculture will provide habitat for a broad suite of bird species, but that specific species will reflect successional stage, horizontal and vertical vegetative structure, and compositional diversity of the buffer vegetation. These results emphasize the importance of matching buffer design and management to species requirements if the objectives are to attract specific target species or species groups.",0

The botanical composition of the plots was examined on four occasions between 2002 and 2004 using permanent, nested quadrats. Emergence traps were used to measure invertebrate abundance within treatment plots and the main sward. Results indicated that 1) exclusion of nutrient inputs had a positive effect on plant species richness within the fi eld margins; 2) plant species richness decreased with increased distance from the hedgerow; 3) herb species richness was greatest in the 1.5m closest to the hedgerow; 4) greater abundance of invertebrates occurred within the 3.5m-wide margins; 5) successful control of Pteridium aquilinum was achieved through spot treatment with the selective herbicide ‘Asulox’; and 6) a combination of management techniques such as cutting and grazing is likely to enhance plant species richness and facilitate the structural diversity of vegetation that is necessary for many invertebrate taxa.",1

Wide field borders supported two times more birds (7.0 birds/0.2 ha) than narrow borders (3.6 birds/ 0.2 ha), which supported six times more birds than no border (0.6 birds/0.2 ha). Mean bird species richness was over five times greater in bordered (0.80-1.10 species/0.2 ha) than non-bordered margins (0.14 species/0.2 ha), but was largely uninfluenced by border width. We documented more bird use of agricultural fields and wooded fencerows adjacent to bordered than non-bordered margins. Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and Dickcissels (Spiza americana) had the strongest positive response to field border presence and width. Wide borders attracted high densities (2.0 birds/0.2 ha) of Dickcissels, an edge-sensitive species, suggesting the conservation potential of herbaceous vegetation patches ,50 m of wooded edges for grassland birds. Extensive implementation of field borders, particularly of enhanced width, may contribute substantially to grassland bird conservation strategies in intensive, agricultural landscapes, although confirmation of these benefits requires additional demographic information.

Non-point source contamination of agricultural pesticides is widely acknowledged as one of the most important anthropogenic stressors in stream ecosystems. We surveyed the occurrence of 31 pesticides and evaluated their potential toxicity for benthic macroinvertebrates using Toxic Units (TU) in 14 Danish 1st-and 2nd-order streams in bed sediments and stream water during storm flow and base flow. Total pesticide concentrations and toxic potential were highest during storm flow events with maximum TU ranging from −6.63 to −1.72. We found that minimum buffer strip width in the near upstream area was the most important parameter governing TU. Furthermore, adding a function for minimum buffer strip width to the Runoff Potential (RP) model increased its power to predict measured TUs from 46% to 64%. However, including a function for tile drainage capacity is probably equally important and should be considered in future research in order to further optimise the RP model.

While landscape context and habitat quality are known to influence species richness and abundance of bees, there is a lack of evidence from manipulative field experiments on bees' responses to adaptive management across differently structured landscapes. We present the results of a large-scale study that investigated the effects of a targeted agri-environment scheme (AES) on bumble bees (Bombus spp.) over three years in the United Kingdom. Forage patches of different sizes were sown with a conservation flower mixture across eight sites covering a broad range of agricultural land use types. Species richness and worker densities (especially of the longer-tongued Bombus species for which the mixture was targeted) were significantly higher on sown forage patches than on existing non-crop control habitats throughout the three-year study, but the strength of this response depended on both the proportions of arable land and abundance of herbaceous forb species in the surrounding landscape. The size of sown patches also affected worker density, with smaller patches (0.25 ha) attracting higher densities of some species than larger patches (1.0 ha). Our models show that a targeted AES can deliver greater net benefits in more intensively farmed areas, in terms of the number and species richness of bumble bees supported, than in heterogeneous landscapes where other foraging habitats exist. These findings serve to strengthen the evidence base for extending agri-environment schemes to boost declining pollinator populations to a larger number of agricultural landscapes across the globe.",0

Ecotones, defined as the transitionary area of vegetation between woody plant species and the arable crop, are an especially important landscape element for birds and arthropods. In this manuscript, we aimed to evaluate which hedgerow attribute was best at predicting avian densities in a conventional and organic farming landscape. Furthermore, we wished to investigate if these same hedgerow attributes could explain arthropod family density, richness and diversity, and how these were correlated to avian densities. An information theory-based multimodel inference method was used to identify which factors influenced variability in avian densities. Although not always significant, avian densities increased with arthropod richness at our study sites. Ecotone width is the best predictor of avian densities and arthropod richness while percent gap is the most important factor if a manager wishes to increase avian diversity (H’) in hedgerow habitats. Increasing ecotone width benefits both avian densities and arthropod richness that in turn further increases bird numbers in our farming landscape.",0

In the heavily cultivated regions of the Midwestern United States, these buffer zones established under the Farm Bill provide important habitat for wildlife such as butterflies. The question of how the landscape context of these plantings influences their use has not been adequately researched. We used multiple regression and Akaike's Information Criteria to determine how habitat width and several landscape-level factors (i.e., landscape composition [total herbaceous cover, amount of developed area, and amount of wooded cover] and configuration [herbaceous edge density]) influenced the abundance and diversity of the butterfly community using filter strips in southwestern Minnesota, USA. Habitat-sensitive butterfly abundance and all richness and diversity measures were positively correlated with filter-strip width. Butterfly abundance was negatively associated with the amount of developed areas (cities, towns, and roads) within the area of a 1-km radius (3.14 km2) surrounding the sites. Percentage of wooded cover in the landscape was an important variable explaining individual species abundance, although the direction of the relationship varied. Our finding that landscape context influences butterfly use of filter strips highlights the importance of landscape-level approaches to wildlife conservation in agroecosystems.",0

1
The behaviour of two butterfly species, a habitat specialist (Speyeria idalia) and a habitat generalist (Danaus plexippus), was tracked at four prairie edges to determine the extent to which edges act as a barrier to emigration. The four edge types studied were crop, road, field and treeline. The edges differed in structure ranging from high-contrast (treeline) to low-contrast (field).

2
S. idalia, the habitat specialist, responded strongly to all edges, even those with low structural contrast. However, S. idalia’s response was strongly affected by conspecific density at crop and field edges; individuals were less likely to exit from high density plots. S. idalia responded to edges both by turning to avoid crossing them, and returning to the plot if they had crossed.

3
D. plexippus responded strongly only to treeline edges. Wind direction and time of year were important factors influencing behaviour at edges for this species. Conspecific density was not a significant factor affecting their behaviour. D. plexippus responded to edges by not crossing them, but rarely returned once they had crossed.

4
In highly fragmented landscapes, such as the one in which this study occurred, butterflies which show little or no response to edges may exhibit high emigration rates because of the high probability of encountering an edge in small habitat patches. Butterflies may respond strongly to even subtle habitat boundaries, but those responses may be modified by the edge structure, local environment or other conditions. Therefore, modifying edge structure may be a way to influence emigration rates, making it a useful tool for conservation.",0

The establishment of grassy strips at the margins of arable fields is an agri-environment scheme that aims to provide resources for native flora and fauna and thus increase farmland biodiversity. These margins can be managed to target certain groups, such as farmland birds and pollinators, but the impact of such management on the soil fauna has been poorly studied. This study assessed the effect of seed mix and management on the biodiversity, conservation and functional value of field margins for soil macrofauna. 2. Experimental margin plots were established in 2001 in a winter wheat field in Cambridgeshire, UK, using a factorial design of three seed mixes and three management practices [spring cut, herbicide application and soil disturbance (scarification)]. In spring and autumn 2005, soil cores taken from the margin plots and the crop were hand-sorted for soil macrofauna. The Lumbricidae, Isopoda, Chilopoda, Diplopoda, Carabidae and Staphylinidae were identified to species and classified according to feeding type. 3. Diversity in the field margins was generally higher than in the crop, with the Lumbricidae, Isopoda and Coleoptera having significantly more species and/or higher abundances in the margins. Within the margins, management had a significant effect on the soil macrofauna, with scarified plots containing lower abundances and fewer species of Isopods. The species composition of the scarified plots was similar to that of the crop. 4. Scarification also reduced soil- and litter-feeder abundances and predator species densities, although populations appeared to recover by the autumn, probably as a result of dispersal from neighbouring plots and boundary features. The implications of the responses of these feeding groups for ecosystem services are discussed. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that the management of agri-environment schemes can significantly influence their value for soil macrofauna. In order to encourage the litter-dwelling invertebrates that tend to be missing from arable systems, agri-environment schemes should aim to minimize soil cultivation and develop a substantial surface litter layer. However, this may conflict with other aims of these schemes, such as enhancing floristic and pollinator diversity.",0

Potted coriander plants under field conditions were used to test: (i) the contribution of insect pollination (open versus bagged umbels) to coriander seed production and (ii) the contribution of floral margins (mixed or monospecific) to pollinator visitation to coriander.
Although coriander showed the capacity to self-pollinate, bagged umbels (no insect pollination) produced significantly less seeds than open-pollinated coriander umbels.
In the vicinity of floral margins (mixed or monospecific), coriander plants were more frequently visited by pollinators than control plants (no margins), which consequently improved seed production and quality (seed weight and germination rate).
Finally, the present study showed that the presence of both mixed and monospecific margins can improve the production of coriander seeds by more than 220% and, in addition, conserve local pollinators within agro-ecosystems.",1

Agricultural practices in the UK have come under increased scrutiny since the heavy and widespread flooding of 2000 and 2001. Although the impact of land use on runoff and flood risk is of growing concern, there are few quantitative data available. A preliminary study was undertaken in the Nant Pontbren catchment, mid-Wales. Experimental tree shelterbelts were established in selected pastures of land used for sheep grazing. Water infiltration rates were up to 60 times higher in areas planted with young trees than in adjacent grazed pastures.

This is likely to be just one of the environmental and economic benefits of planting trees to re-create a more diverse agricultural landscape.",1

Windbreaks decrease wind speed, reducing damage to the crop and improving yield and quality. Sheltering may improve microclimate conditions for plant growth and protects the soil from wind erosion. Aspects of the sheltering ability of four different windbreaks have been tested: single and double row herbaceous (Tritio secale) shelterbelts, and two different artificial wooden fences, with the same overall average porosity, but with different porosity distributions. Mean velocity, turbulence intensity, skewness distributions and spectral and wavelet analysis have been performed in order to characterise the turbulent flow downstream of the different windbreaks. Wheat grain yield and harvest index were compared with adjacent unsheltered plantations. The single and double row shelterbelts enhanced the grain yield and the harvest index of the protected plants. An influence of the turbulent structure on plant growth is suggested by the different response of plants sheltered by the two types of artificial fences.",0

Appropriate agroforestry practices in Saskatchewan include field and farmyard shelterbelts, wildlife plantations, poplar plantations and managed woodlots. A study was conducted to determine the amount of carbon held in prairie shelterbelts. The effect of the soil type and tree species on biomass and carbon content was measured in shelterbelts in the brown, dark brown and black soil zones of Saskatchewan. For some of the main shelterbelt species, the mean aboveground carbon content was 79 kg/tree (32 t/km) for green ash, 263 kg/tree (105 t/km) for poplar, 144 kg/tree (41 t/km) for white spruce and 26 t/km for caragana. In the brown and the dark brown soils, which are more arid than the black soil zone, trees had 60.6% and 65.5%, respectively, of the biomass and carbon content of trees and shrubs in the black soil zone. Improved, fast-growing poplar clones had the greatest biomass at maturity and fixed the greatest amount of carbon. Simple equations were developed to calculate the carbon contents of prairie shelterbelts, based on easily measured tree or shrub parameters.

The main objectives of this study were to: 1) determine if effectiveness of a filter strip changes over years since establishment, and 2) determine if temporal change depends on vegetation type. Four vegetation treatments were replicated five times in 3 × 7.5 m (10 × 25 ft) plots. Plots containing all-grass (New Grass) and grass with trees and shrubs (New Forest) were established in spring of 1995 among otherwise similar plots that contained either grass since ca. 1970 (Old Grass) or were re-cultivated and re-planted annually with grain sorghum (Crop). Once each summer, in 1995, 1996, 1997, 2003, and 2004, identically prepared solutions containing sediment, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer, and bromide tracer were applied to the upper end of each plot during a simulated rainfall event of 2.5 cm (1 in) in 30 minutes, and the load and concentration of runoff components were measured in outflow from the plots. Retention of solution components and reduction of their concentrations by the New Grass and New Forest plots improved from effectiveness similar or less than the Crop plots to effectiveness similar to the Old Grass plots within three growing seasons. Improvement coincided with the development of denser vegetative ground cover and a slower rate of runoff flow through the plots. Change in infiltration accounted for most of the improvement in overall effectiveness. There was no evidence of divergence in the performance of New Grass and New Forest plots. We conclude that filter strip performance improves over a period of years since establishment. Most of the change occurs within three growing seasons after establishment. Infiltration characteristics account for most of that change. Grass and forest vegetation are equally effective as filter strips for at least 10 growing seasons after establishment.",0

Data were extracted from 11 farms surveyed by territory mapping between 1966 and 1986 as part of the British Trust for Ornithology's Common Birds Census. The population size of 38 bird species was quantified for each farm in each year. The extents of five non-crop habitats were measured at 4-yearly intervals on each farm. The farms were selected because some had undergone extensive removal of non-crop habitats while others had undergone little or none. Although declines were commonest on farms where the severest habitat loss had taken place, we found no evidence that habitat loss was the main factor causing population declines: all 11 farms had significant numbers of declining species, even where habitat loss was minimal. Furthermore, general linear modelling found no significant effects of habitat loss on population trends and principal-components analysis found limited effects of habitat extent on community composition. These results suggest that habitat loss is of secondary importance in causing farmland bird population declines. We suggest that other processes, such as habitat degradation, may have caused a baseline population decline in at least 10 farmland bird species and that declines may have been exacerbated by localised habitat loss.",0

The most widely occurring species were: Staphylinus caesareus, Tachyporus hypnorum, Philonthus cognatus, Aloconota gregaria, Tachyporus chrysomelinus and T. obtusus. Although species from Tachyporus spp. were dominant in cumulative samples, the activity density decreased considerably for the second half of the vegetation period. The fields' structure and the treatments have a significant role in forming the dominance of species. Also the dynamics of each species is highly influenced by the disturbances. These could be explained with different microclimatic and humidity tolerance of the species. The greater mobility of staphylinids may enable them to avoid pesticide treatments in individual fields. These factors (natural weed cower, the presence of the hedgerows and the flying ability of the species) can interact and offer optimal possibilities for predation in agricultural fields.",1

A previous study reveals high chloride (Cl) accumulation in the soil under a bottomland oak hedgerow in western France. Our study tests whether Cl can be used as an indicator of the spatial extent of tree root activity. Cl was analyzed in soil profiles up to 2 m deep along transects perpendicular to hedgerows. One site was explored in detail to examine the role of hedgerow position on the slope, supplemented with multi-annual and multi-site studies on bottomland hedgerows. Upslope Cl accumulation was highest near the tree line (and up to 6 m away) and around 1 m deep. Downslope it extended up to 18 m from the tree line and near the surface. This difference was caused by differences in water availability or physical soil constraints. Cl accumulation was found in both temporal (multi-annual) and spatial (multi-site) studies. Cl accumulation under oak hedgerows can be used to identify the lateral extent and depth of water uptake by roots. It results from root activity over many years.

Direct fluorescent antibody analysis was used to quantitate cysts in 350 storm runoff samples. G. duodenalis was detected on all five dairy farms, with fluxes of 1 to 14,000 cysts/liter observed in 16% of samples. Cysts were detected in 41% of runoff samples collected near cattle less than 2 months old, compared to 10% of runoff samples collected near cattle over 6 months old. Furthermore, the concentrations and instantaneous loads of cysts were >65 and >79 times greater, respectively, in runoff from sites housing young calves than in sites housing other age classes of animals. Factors associated with environmental loading of G. duodenalis included cattle age, cattle stocking number, and precipitation but not lot area, land slope, or cattle density. Vegetated buffer strips were found to significantly reduce waterborne cysts in storm runoff: each additional meter of vegetated buffer placed below high-cattle-use areas was associated with reductions in the concentration and instantaneous load of cysts by factors of 0.86 and 0.79 (0.07 and 0.10 log10/m), respectively. Straw mulch, seed application, scraping of manure, and cattle exclusion did not significantly affect the concentration or load of G. duodenalis cysts. The study findings suggest that vegetated buffer strips, especially when placed near dairy calf areas, should help reduce the environmental loading of these fecal protozoa discharging from dairy farms.",1

Here we investigate impacts of non-crop woody vegetation variables, adjacent crop type and abundance of aphid prey on coccinellid abundance in shelterbelts adjacent to vineyards or pasture near Melbourne, Australia. Sixty sites were sampled five times at monthly intervals using yellow sticky traps. The abundance of coccinellids in shelterbelts was influenced to a greater extent by adjacent crop type and aphid abundance rather than vegetation characteristics like canopy flowers. Abundance of some species was 2–5 times higher in riparian shelterbelts while increased litter depth decreased abundance. When the leaf litter depth of shelterbelts was experimentally increased, the abundance of coccinellids decreased, whereas an experimental decrease in porosity tended to have the opposite effect. These findings suggest that coccinellid abundance can be influenced to some extent by characteristics of shelterbelts, but crop type and prey availability is likely to have a relatively larger impact, perhaps reflecting the high movement rates of this group of natural enemies.",0

Several investigations, even during snowmelt season, have shown that retention of sediments and sediment-bound nutrients in runoff water has been high through buffer zones (BZ). It is likely that BZ also can be effective filters for sediment-bound pesticides. The retention of glyphosate, propiconazole, fenpropimorph and soil particles was studied in surface runoff experiments with 5 m wide buffer zones. Volume proportional samples were collected after each runoff episode (1999–2002). The distribution coefficient (K d ) shows moderate to high adsorption of the pesticides to the experimental soil. Results show average retention efficiency of about 51%, 48%, 85% and 34% for particles, glyphosate, propiconazole and fenpropimorph, respectively. The amount of AMPA (which is a degradation product of glyphosate), entering the BZ was high; approximately the same amount as for glyphosate. The retention efficiency through the BZ for AMPA was about 67%. There were no significant differences in removal efficiency (in %) between winter with snowmelt and summer. This is possibly due to detachment of coarser aggregates during winter, which trap more easily in the BZ. The conclusion based on this study suggests BZ to be contributors to reduced pesticide input to surface waters.",0

In this study, we used molecular phylogenetic and genotypic information to infer species diversity, reproductive potential and genetic structure of Beauveria occurring within a single arable field and bordering hedgerow in Denmark. Isolates were sampled from cultivated field and hedgerow soils, from insects harbouring latent fungal infections, and from the phylloplanes of three plant species common in the hedgerow flora. A nuclear phylogeny of this local Beauveria assemblage resolved seven phylogenetic species, including (i) five phylogenetic species within Beauveria bassiana sensu stricto; (ii) Clade C, a taxonomically uncharacterized species that is morphologically indistinguishable but phylogenetically distant from B. bassiana s.s.; and (iii) Beauveria brongniartii. All seven species were present throughout the hedgerow habitat, including as infections in insects. Significantly, only B. bassiana s.s. phylogenetic species Eu_1 was isolated from tilled soils. Mating type polymerase chain reaction assays demonstrated that all five B. bassiana s.s. phylogenetic species possess bipolar outcrossing mating systems. Of these, only the Eu_1 population contained two mating types; however, a 31:2 skew in MAT1:MAT2 mating types suggests a low frequency of sexual reproduction in this population. The four remaining B. bassiana s.s. phylogenetic species were fixed for single mating types and these populations are evidently clonal. Multilocus microsatellite genotyping revealed polymorphism in all five phylogenetic species of B. bassiana s.s.; however, all show evidence of clonal genetic structure.",1

Declines in abundance and diversity of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) in Europe have been linked to agricultural intensification and the resulting loss of suitable foraging and nesting habitats. Environmental Stewardship (ES) is a new scheme in England offering the opportunity to restore habitats of value for these important pollinators to agricultural land. Scientific evaluation of the options prescribed within the scheme is essential to ensure that their objectives are met and that the benefits can be realized by the full bumble bee species assemblage. 2. We compared the efficacy of different ES options for field margins on arable land in enhancing the abundance and diversity of flowering resources and foraging bumble bees. Our study was conducted over 3 years using a multisite experiment. 3. Overall, uncropped margins sown with mixtures containing nectar and pollen-producing plants were more effective in providing bumble bee forage than margins sown with a grass mix, allowed to regenerate naturally or managed as conservation headlands. 4. A mixture of agricultural legumes established quickly and attracted on average the highest total abundance and diversity of bumble bees, including the rare long-tongued species Bombus ruderatus and Bombus muscorum. However, marked differences were observed between species and sexes in their responses to field margin management over time. 5. A diverse mixture of native wildflowers attracted more of the shorter-tongued Bombus spp. and provided greater continuity of forage resources, especially early in the season. Allowing Cirsium spp. to flower on such margins also increased their attractiveness to male bumble bees. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the legume-based 'pollen and nectar flower mix', as prescribed under Entry Level Stewardship in England, can quickly provide a highly attractive forage resource for bumble bees, but that issues of seasonal flowering phenology and longevity of the mixture need to be addressed. Establishment of 'floristically enhanced margins' under Higher Level Stewardship will be important to provide diverse perennial communities of forage plants and to support a greater range of Bombus spp. and other pollinators. The population-level responses of bumble bees to introduced seed mixtures and other agri-environment options require further study in order to maximize the benefits of such schemes in intensively farmed landscapes. © 2006 The Authors.",0

The analysis of the seed bank of these hedge banks showed that the species richness and diversity differed in relation to the date of construction of the hedge banks. The seed banks of recent hedge banks were richer and more diversified than those of old hedge banks. Differences in the floristic composition of the established plant cover between the recent and old hedge banks were determined by multivariate analyses. The species exclusively found in the seed bank and in the herb cover of recent hedge banks were mainly grassland species, whereas the species that only occurred on old hedge banks tended to be woodland species. The floristic composition of the two compartments (established vegetation and seed bank) was very different. A multivariate analysis revealed that the difference between the composition of the seed banks of recent and old hedge banks was less than that between the composition of the established vegetation and seed bank of hedge banks of the same age. Both seed bank and vegetation of recent hedge banks were dominated by ruderal species, whereas old hedge vegetation was dominated by stress-tolerant woodland species, indicating that mechanically constructed hedge banks may impose limitations on colonization by late woodland species.",1

The objective of this study was to characterize macroporosity of soils under a perennial grass hedge system for 12 yr using x-ray computed tomography (CT) and to compare CT-macroporosity results with macroporosity estimated from water retention data. Three positions were sampled: grass hedge position, deposition zone position 0.5 m upslope from grass hedges, and row crop position 7 m upslope from the hedges. Intact core samples (76 mm x 76 mm) were collected from two depths, 0 to 100 and 100 to 200 mm, with five replicates per position per depth. Number of pores (macro- and meso-), averaged across depths, in the grass hedge were nearly 2.5 times greater than those in the row crop and five times greater than in the deposition positions; however their circularity was 8.8% lower than in the row crop and 2.6% lower than in the deposition positions. The CT-measured macroporosity was significantly greater (P < 0.01) for the grass hedge position (0.056 m 3 m ""') as compared with the row crop (0.014 m 3 m - 3 ) and deposition positions (0.006 m 3 m - 3 ). The fractal dimension (D) was significantly greater (P < 0.01) for the grass hedge position (D = 1.56) than in the row crop (D = 1.31) and the deposition (D = 1.12) positions. The values of all measured pore characteristics decreased with depth. Computed tomography-measured macroporosity data were comparable with macroporosity estimated from water retention data. These findings suggest that grass hedge systems have created more pores and a greater volume of macroporosity.",2

However, observational evidence suggests that concentrated flow is prevalent from agricultural fields. Over time sediment can accumulate in riparian buffers forming berms that restrict sheet flow; these berms ultimately back up surface runoff, resulting in an eventual breakthrough that concentrates overland flow. This study examines the occurrence of concentrated flow paths (CFPs) in riparian buffers at both the field and watershed scale. At the field scale, intensive topographic surveys were conducted at ten field sites in southern Illinois. To assess the prevalence of CFPs at the watershed scale, three watersheds in southern Illinois were selected for walking stream surveys along randomly selected 1,000 m reaches. CFPs were identified in all topographic surveys and all walking stream surveys. Among field sites, concentrated flow accounted for 82.5–100% of the drainage leaving the agricultural fields. Sediment berm accumulation was identified at all field sites and was positively correlated with CFP size. At the watershed scale, CFPs were more abundant in agricultural areas compared to forested land. Results from this study indicate that concentrated flow was prevalent across all study sites at both the field and watershed scale. Thus, surface water quality may suffer in areas with poorly functioning buffers, and managers must consider the occurrence of CFPs when designing and maintaining riparian buffers to protect stream water quality.",0

Interactions between fleshy-fruited plants and frugivorous birds are highly seasonal in temperate ecosystems. Nevertheless, combined effects of landscape modification and seasonal variation on plant-frugivore interactions have never been assessed from a network perspective. Here, we present the first study that simultaneously investigates effects of landscape modification and seasonal variation on plant-frugivore interactions and on functional and interaction diversity of plant-frugivore networks. We recorded visitation rates of 39 frugivorous bird species to 28 fruiting-plant species in Central Germany from early summer to late autumn in hedgerows within three landscape types arranged along a gradient of decreasing anthropogenic modification and increasing structural diversity (i.e., farmland, orchard, forest edge). We analyzed how species richness, abundance, and community composition, as well as functional and interaction diversity of fruiting plants and frugivorous birds changed with landscape type, fruit availability, and season. We found that visitation rates of frugivorous birds were lower in farmland, but only in summer. In autumn, visitation rates were similar in all landscape types and strongly increased with increasing local fruit availability. The functional diversity of fruits and frugivorous birds and their interaction diversity remained surprisingly constant in all landscape types. Due to seasonal changes in communities of fruiting plants and frugivorous birds, functional dispersion of fruiting plants was lower in autumn than in summer, whereas functional richness and dispersion of frugivorous birds was higher in autumn than in summer. Our results indicate that seasonal changes in fruit availability influence the abundance of frugivorous birds along gradients of structural diversity at the landscape scale. Although seasonal fluctuations influenced the functional diversity of avian frugivore communities, we found constant interaction diversity of plant-frugivore networks in space and time, probably due to the functional redundancy of frugivorous birds. These findings indicate a high robustness of avian frugivory to moderate levels of human-induced landscape modification in temperate ecosystems and call for studies testing the generality of these findings for ultimate avian seed dispersal functions.",1

Predatory beetles are amongst the most numerous and diverse arthropods present in arable fields. The primary ecosystem services provided by predatory beetles are in biological control and food chain maintenance as they are a key resource for many higher organisms. However, to be effective biological control agents, able to respond quickly to wherever a pest infestation occurs, then they must be sufficiently abundant and widely distributed. Conservation biocontrol utilising predatory beetles has focussed on the impact of species that overwinter in adjacent field boundaries, although those overwintering within fields are often more abundant. If the abundance and distribution of predatory beetles is to be maximised then further knowledge of their spatial dynamics is required to ensure habitats are arranged appropriately. The spatio-temporal dynamics of boundary and field overwintering species was measured across 64 ha encompassing six fields and for three consecutive years using a grid of 973 pitfall traps. Boundary species were more numerous in spring (May and June) whereas more field species were captured in July. The species composition was comprised of relatively few taxa. Boundary species occurred in small patches that were distributed across the fields in spring, but were only found close to the margins in July. Patches persisted in some locations over two years. Field species occurred in larger patches, spread across particular fields and these were stable within years and to some extent between years. Game-cover strips were attractive to boundary species in the spring and summer and did not effect predator distribution in the adjacent crop.",0

MOPS1 is a recently completed 3-year research project on three different soil types in the UK, which focused on mitigation options for winter cereals. MOPS1 demonstrated that tramlines can be the major pathway for sediment and nutrient transfer from arable hillslopes, and that although minimum tillage, crop residue incorporation, contour cultivation, and beetle banks also have potential to be cost-effective mitigation options, tramline management is the one of the most promising treatments for mitigating diffuse pollution losses, as it was able to reduce sediment and nutrient losses by 72–99% in four out of five site years trialled.

The aim of this study was to investigate if different landscape variables are related to wireworm infestation, represented by the proportion of wireworm damaged potato tubers. Based on aerial photographs and field surveys landscape variables, such as landscape composition, landscape complexity and ecological variables were characterised around 14 randomly selected potato field plots alongside the gradient from the lower warm-dry “Weinviertel” (region 1) to the cool-humid “Waldviertel” (region 2) in the North-East of Austria at three scales (1, 9 and 25 ha). Relationships between landscape variables and wireworm damage ratings were described by Spearman correlations coefficients. Our results showed that wireworm damage was higher in region 2 than in region 1 and tended to be higher in soils with higher sand content. Among the tested landscape variables only landscape composition, especially grassy field margins were significantly positively correlated with wireworm damage at the 25 ha scale. In areas with high proportion of such grassy habitats, farmers should pay more attention to field characteristics, such as sand content in soil, and management, like crop rotation. Further investigations on appropriate management regimes for grassy landscape elements suppressing wireworm populations but ensuring the maintenance of natural pest control should be conducted.",0

Butterfly species richness was significantly greater on the 2 m margins than on the control sections, and was greater when a higher number of grass species were included in the original seed mixture. Plant species richness was greater on the 6 m margins when established by natural regeneration. CSS grass margins could be improved as butterfly habitats if they are linked to existing habitats such as hedgerows, are sown with a better range of native grasses and herbs and are managed in a way more conducive to wildlife.

1. To evaluate the spatial extent of the effects of forest cover on stream ecosystems, we measured algae, invertebrate, and fish biomass and invertebrate and fish community structure in 38 small first- to third-order streams in the National Capital Region of Canada along with forest cover at different spatial scales.



2. We considered 55 spatial scales of forest cover including several buffer widths (doubling 10–320 m) and lengths (doubling 10–1280 m, entire riparian distance upstream from sampling area) and entire catchments to determine which spatial scale maximized the correlation with biomass and metrics of community structure.



3. The proportion of variability in biomass and structural metrics explained by forest cover generally increased with increasing scale, suggesting that catchment-wide disturbances are the most influential determinants of benthic and fish communities.



4. Catchment forest cover explained more variation in algal (adjusted r2 = 0.54), invertebrate (adjusted r2 = 0.51) and fish (adjusted r2 = 0.33) biomass than structural metrics of invertebrates and fish (adjusted r2 = 0.08–0.27).



5. Analyses of the partial effects of forest cover at three scales (reach, riparian and the entire catchment) on biomass and community structure metrics identified catchment and reach scales as being most influential and never detected a significant partial effect of forest cover at the riparian scale.



6. These results suggest that maintenance or protection of reach and riparian buffers alone will not sufficiently protect stream function and structure from catchment-wide impacts.",0

Management, crop and boundary structure influences on invertebrate activity were assessed, as was the relationship between crop and boundary type. Classification of crop and boundary assemblages produced three and two groups, respectively, in both years. Organic arable crops had well-defined assemblages in both years; and, while grass and grass/clover fields were separated from conventional arable fields in 2005, there was mixing in 2006. One boundary group, in both years, was dominated by conventional arable fields with tall herbaceous boundary vegetation. The other group had more organic arable and grassy fields with shorter boundary vegetation. Redundancy analyses showed that a number of groups (Cantharidae, Coccinellidae, Syrphidae, Ichneumonidae, Braconidae, Proctotrupoidea, Lycosidae) were more active in organic arable fields with more Staphylinidae in conventional arable crops and no obvious trend with Carabidae, Hemiptera, Neuroptera and Linyphiidae. Activity of some groups, especially Coccinellidae, Syrphidae and parasitic wasps, was strongly related to weed cover. Staphylinidae were most active in tall herbaceous boundaries by conventional arable crops with more of a number of groups (Cantharidae, Coccinellidae, parasitic wasps) in short herbaceous boundaries by organic arable crops. Organic management produced most differences in aerially-dispersed invertebrates, and management had a profound effect on activity in field boundaries. Possible management prescriptions to increase invertebrate activity include changing sowing times, weed cover manipulation and field boundary and margin management.",1

Soil porosity can be significantly influenced by buffer vegetation which affects water transport and water quality. The objective of the study was to compare differences in computed tomography (CT)-measured macroporosity (>1,000-μm diam.) and coarse mesoporosity (200- to 1,000-μm diam.) parameters for agroforestry and grass buffer systems associated with rotationally grazed and continuously grazed pasture systems. Soils at the site were Menfro silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludalf). Six replicate intact soil cores, 76.2 mm diam. by 76.2 mm long, were collected using a core sampler from the four treatments at five soil depths (0–50 cm at 10-cm intervals). Images were acquired using a hospital CT scanner and subsequently soil bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) were measured after scanning the cores. Image-J software was used to analyze five equally spaced images from each core. Bulk density was 5.9% higher and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) values were five times lower for pasture treatments relative to buffer treatments. For the 0–10 cm soil depth, CT-measured soil macroporosity (>1,000 μm diam.) was 13 times higher for the buffer treatments compared to the pasture treatments. Buffer treatments had greater macroporosity (0.020 m3 m−3) compared to pasture (0.0045 m3 m−3) treatments. CT-measured pore parameters were positively correlated with Ksat.

Only farmers with game and conservation interests claimed to adopt field-boundary management that would benefit Whitethroats, but across all farms, intended and actual herbaceous strips were too narrow, and their management too imprecise, for Whitethroats and other wildlife.

The need for mitigation measures was investigated at 10 stream sites within an intensively used arable region in central Germany by characterizing pesticide exposure following edge-of-field runoff and effects on the aquatic macroinvertebrates. Moreover, the influence of riparian buffer strip width (as a mitigation measure) at the sampling sites was considered. Generally, invertebrate fauna was dominated by pesticide-tolerant species, suggesting a high pesticide exposure at almost all sites. This result is also reflected by the elevated levels of suspended particle contamination in terms of toxic units (logTUMax > −2), corresponding to one-hundredth of the median lethal concentration (LC50) to Daphnia magna. At two sites that received high aqueous-phase entries of the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin (logTUMax > −0.6), the abundance and number of sensitive species in terms of the species at risk index decreased during the pesticide application period. In contrast, no acute significant negative effects on macroinvertebrates were observed at sites characterised by low water-phase toxicity (logTUMax < –3.5). An influence of riparian buffer strip width on pesticide exposure was not observed, supposedly because of the presence of erosion rills and ephemeral ditches. In conclusion, results show that mitigation measures (such as the improvement of currently present riparian buffer strips) are needed in the study area.

Although PFSs are similar to riparian buffers, the processes responsible for NO₃⁻–N removal from PFSs are not well understood. Our objectives were to (i) determine the importance of denitrification as a sink for NO₃⁻–N loss from PFSs and (ii) evaluate how PFSs alter the biophysical processes that affect the relative importance of N₂O and N₂ emissions. To address our objectives, we used a coupled field laboratory approach with experimental watersheds that included the following treatments: (i) PFSs covering the bottom 10% of the watershed and an annual corn–soybean crop rotation covering the remaining upslope 90% (PFS); (ii) 100% corn–soybean rotation (CORN); and (iii) 19-yr-old 100% restored native grassland (RNG). In situ N₂O flux rates and laboratory N₂O/(N₂ + N₂O) ratios were highest in CORN watersheds followed by PFS and RNG watersheds. In contrast, potentially mineralizable C and denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) were highest in PFS and RNG watersheds and lowest in CORN watersheds. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between N₂O/(N₂ + N₂O) ratio and DEA. In the laboratory, N₂ fluxes were highest in PFS followed by RNG and CORN. These results indicate that PFS watersheds support greater total denitrification while emitting less N₂O than croplands. Greater potentially mineralizable C in PFS and RNG suggest C availability is an important factor affecting more complete denitrification. These results suggest PFSs function similar to riparian buffers and have potential to reduce NO₃⁻–N losses from annual croplands by denitrification to N₂.",0

Mean site denitrification rates ranging from 0.6 to 1.9 mgN/kg soil/day were measured using intact core incubation techniques. Thethree riparian sites covered with grass each exhibited greaterdenitrification rates than the wooded site. Denitrification rate wascorrelated with moisture content but not with nitrate-N or organic carboncontents. Denitrification rates were greatest near the soil surface and atpositions nearest the stream. Rates decreased uniformly with distance awayfrom the stream and also with depth in the soil for each site. While patternsof nitrate-N, moisture, and organic carbon content differ among the sites,their combined effects on denitrification support the observed, consistentdenitrification rate pattern.KEY WORDS: Denitrification; Riparian ecosystems",0

The objectives of this experiment were to (i) assess denitrification activity within a riparian zone and (ii) determine the influence of physical, chemical, and landscape features on denitrification. This experiment was conducted from 1994 to 1997 in North Carolina on a riparian zone contiguous to a spray field that was heavily loaded with swine lagoon wastewater. Denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) was measured on soils collected from (i) the soil surface, (ii) midway between the soil surface and water table, and (iii) above the water table. The DEA ranged from 3 to 1660 microg N(2)O-N kg(-1) soil h(-1). The DEA was highest next to the stream and lowest next to the spray field. Nitrate was found to be the limiting factor for denitrification. The DEA generally decreased with soil depth; means for the surface, middle, and bottom depths were 147, 83, and 67 microg N(2)O-N kg(-1) soil h(-1), respectively. These DEA values are higher than those reported for riparian zones adjoining cropland of the southeastern United States, but are lower than those reported for a constructed wetland used for treatment of swine wastewater. Regression analysis indicated that soil total nitrogen was the highest single factor correlated to DEA (r(2) = 0.65). The inclusion of water table depth, soil depth, and distance from the spray field improved the R(2) to 0.86. This riparian zone possessed sufficient soil area with high denitrifying conditions to be a significant factor in the removal of excess nitrogen in the ground water.",1

A suitable riparian zone was identified at Cuddesdon Mill on the River Thame floodplain near Oxford, England. Measurements were made of water and nitrate moving from arable land through the riparian zone and into the river. Techniques to measure denitrification were tested and applied, and the factors controlling denitrification measured. While there was considerable potential for denitrification at the site, this was not realized because much of the water moving off the farmland bypassed the riparian zone, entering the river directly via springs or through gravel lenses beneath the floodplain soil. Management of this site would not reduce nitrate leaching unless the floodplain hydrology could be substantially modified, and the main conclusion is that nitrate buffer zones will only operate efficiently where the hydrology of the site is appropriate.

Only the carabid Clivina fossor and staphylinids belonging to the genus Lathrobium were evenly distributed throughout the entire area.

Changes in agricultural practices during the past 50 years have been suggested as one of the major causes of this decline. Field-border conservation practices encouraged by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Conservation Buffer Initia- tive meet many of the needs of sustainable agriculture and offer excellent opportunities to enhance local grassland bird populations within intensive agricultural production systems. Despite the abundant information on avian use of, and reproductive success in, strip habitats during the breeding season, few studies have examined the potential value of field borders for wintering birds. We planted 89.0 km of field borders (6.1 m wide) along agricultural field edges on one-half of each of three row crop and forage production farms in northeastern Mississippi. We sampled bird communities along these field edges during February-March 2002 and 2003 using line-transect distance sampling and strip transects to estimate density and community structure, respectively. We used Program DISTANCE to estimate densities of Song (Melospiza melodia), Savannah (Passerculus sand- wichensis), and other sparrows along bordered and non-bordered transects while controlling for adjacent plant community. Greater densities of several sparrow species were observed along most bordered transects. However, effects of field borders differed by species and adjacent plant community types. Diversity, species richness, and relative conservation value (a weighted index derived by multiplying species-specific abundances by their re- spective Partners in Flight conservation priority scores) were similar between bordered and non-bordered edges.

The distribution of the carabid beetle Nebria brevicollis was monitored in the summer during a period of declining activity associated with aestivation in a hedgerow. After emergence from aestivation, population density, distribution and dispersal of N. brevicollis were studied during autumn 1994 in a mark-recapture experiment. 3560 beetles were marked and 1887 were recaptured in a grid of pitfall traps spanning a hedgerow and extending approximately 32 m either side into two recently harvested cereal fields. Population size, estimated from a Lincoln index, increased slightly with time with a mean population density of approximately 0.9 beetles m−2. Activity-density varied during the experiment and was significantly related to maximum temperature. The population was aggregated within the hedgerow during aestivation and in several spatially stable hot-spots of activity-density within the field during autumn. There was considerable movement within fields but the hedgerow was a significant barrier to dispersal between fields, with potential effects on the metapopulation structure of the species.",0

Bear Creek, is typical of many streams in Central Iowa where the primary land use along the stream's length is row crop (corn and soybeans) production agriculture or intensive riparian zone grazing. The Bear Creek watershed is long (∼ 35 km), narrow (3–6 km), and drains 7,661 ha of farmland. The MSRBS system is a 20 m wide filter strip consisting of four or five rows of fast-growing trees planted closest to the stream, then two shrub rows, and finally a 7 m wide strip of switchgrass established next to the agricultural fields. The 1.0 km long system, is located on an operational farm and is laid out in a split block design on both sides of Bear Creek. An integral part of this system is a streambank stabilization soil bioengineering component and a constructed wetland to intercept NPS pollutants in field drainage tile water flow. It is hypothesized that this system will function effectively as a nutrient, pesticide, and sediment sink for NPS pollutants coming from the upslope agricultural fields. Prior to establishment of the MSRBS system, the riparian zone along Bear Creek was grazed and row cropped to the stream edge. Since 1990 there has been dramatic alteration in the appearance and functioning of this riparian zone. After four growing seasons, the fast-growing tree species (cottonwood, silver maple, willow, and green ash) range in height from 2.4 m to over 5.5 m. Mean (four-year) biomass production of silver maple was 8.4 dry Mg ha−1, more than twice to seven times the yield from other silver maple research plots in Central Iowa. The shrub species, selected because of desired wildlife benefits, have done well in terms of survival and growth with ninebark, Nannyberry viburnum and Nanking cherry doing the best. The switchgrass grass has developed into a dense stand that effectively stops concentrated flow from the agriculture fields and allows for infiltration rates well above the field rate. Early root biomass data indicate significantly more roots below the MSRBS than agricultural fields. This suggests better soil stabilization, absorption of infiltrated water, and soil-root-microbe-NPS pollutant interaction characteristics within the MSRBS system than the cropped fields. Nitrate-nitrogen concentrations in the MSRBS never exceed 2 mg l−1 whereas the levels in the adjacent agricultural fields exceed 12 mg l−1. The water quality data collected suggest that the MSRBS is effective in reducing NPS pollutants in the vadose and saturated zone below the system. The soil bioengineering revetments have stabilized the streambank and minimized bank collapse. Initial results (from 4 months of operation) from the constructed wetland (built in summer 1994) indicate nitrate-nitrogen concentrations of the tile inflow water >15 mg l−1 whereas, the outflow water had a nitrate-nitrogen concentration of <3 mg l−1. Over time this wetland should become more effective in removing excess nitrogen moving with the tile flow from the agricultural fields because of the accumulation of organic matter from the cattails. Overall the MSRBS system seems to be functioning as expected. This MSRBS system offers farmers a way to intercept eroding soil, trap and transform NPS pollution, stabilize streambanks, provide wildlife habitat, produce biomass for on-farm use, produce high-quality hardwood in the future, and enhance the aesthetics of the agroecosystem. As a streamside best management practice (BMP), the MSRBS system complements upland BMPs and provides many valuable private and public market and non-market benefits.",0

Impact assessments documenting how habitat and aquatic biota within streams respond to these practices are needed for evaluating the effects of conservation practices. Numerous sampling protocols have been developed for monitoring streams. However, protocols designed for monitoring studies are not appropriate for impact assessments. We developed guiding principles for designing impact assessments of ecological responses to conservation practices. The guiding principles are as fol- lows: (1) develop the hypothesis first, (2) use replicated experimental designs having controls and treatments, (3) assess the habitat and biological characteristics with quantitative and repeatable sampling methods, (4) use multiple sampling techniques for collecting aquatic organisms, and (5) standardize sampling efforts for aquatic organisms. The guiding principles were applied in designing a study intended to evaluate the influence of herba- ceous riparian buffers on channelized headwater streams in central Ohio. Our example highlights that the application of our recommendations will result in impact assessments that are hypothesis-driven and incorpo- rate quantitative methods for the measurement of abiotic and biotic attributes.

However, buffer system efficacy in pesticide runoff mitigation varies widely due to a multitude of factors including, but not limited to, pesticide chemistry, vegetation composition, and hydrology. Two experimental systems, a control (no vegetation) and a grass–wetland buffer system, were evaluated for their ability to retain diazinon and permethrin associated with a simulated storm runoff. The two systems were equally inefficient at retaining diazinon (mean 9.6 % retention for control and buffer). Grass–wetland buffers retained 83 % and 85 % of cis- and trans-permethrin masses, respectively, while the control only retained 39 % and 44 % of cis- and trans-permethrin masses, respectively. Half-distances (the distance required to decrease pesticide concentration by one-half) for both permethrin isomers were 26 %–30 % shorter in grass buffers (22–23 m) than in the control (32 m). The current study demonstrates treatment efficacy was a function of pesticide properties with the more strongly sorbing permethrin retained to a greater degree. The study also demonstrates challenges in remediating multiple pesticides with a single management practice. By using suites of management practices, especially those employing vegetation, better mitigation of pesticide impacts may be accomplished.",1

Little is known about activity-density and assemblage composition of carabid beetles within sown wildflower areas (SWA) compared with conventional grassy field margins and adjoining arable fields. 2 In 10 landscapes, two pairs of winter wheat fields with adjoining SWA and grassy field margin were studied. We compared activity-density, species richness, ecological traits and assemblage composition of carabids among 20 winter wheat fields, 10 adjoining grassy field margins and 10 adjoining SWA. 3 Beetle activity-density was higher in wheat fields compared with adjoining semi-natural habitats regarding total carabids, macropterous, polyphagous- carnivorous and euryoecious open habitat beetles. Although total species rich- ness (analysis of variance) did not significantly differ among habitat types, we found significantly higher species numbers in SWA than in wheat fields adjoining SWA and grassy margins when the number of recorded species was standardized to the number of individuals (rarefaction). Carabid assemblages in wheat fields differed from assemblages in adjoining SWA and grassy margins. 4 The results of the present study emphasize the important contribution of semi-natural habitats to diversify the spring carabid fauna in agroecosystems. In particular, SWA were shown to be useful to enhance carabid biodiversity conservation in agroecosystems, rather than to enhance their density-dependent functions.",1

Studies examining these effects simultaneously are rare. Here we explore the direct top-down and direct and indirect bottom-up forces regulating the abundance and predation success of an intermediate predator, the web-building spider Argiope bruennichi (Araneae: Araneidae). We manipulated plant diversity (2, 6, 12 or 20 sown species) in 9 wildflower strips in a region of intensive farmland. To identify the major factors regulating the distribution and abundance of A. bruennichi, we quantified three characteristics of vegetation (species diversity, composition and vegetation structure) as well as the spider's prey community and natural enemies. The distribution and abundance of A. bruennichi was regulated by combined bottom-up and top-down processes as well as by direct and indirect interactions between trophic levels. Four main factors were identified: (1) the strong direct effect of vegetation structure, (2) the positive effect of plant species diversity, which affected spider abundance directly and indirectly through increased densities and size of flower-visiting prey species, (3) the positive or negative direct effects of different plant species, and (4) the strongly negative direct effect of predacious hornets. The advantage of taking a global approach to understand the regulation of species abundance is highlighted first by the quantification of the relative importance of factors, with a surprisingly strong effect of hornet predators, and second by the discovery of a direct effect of plant diversity, which raises intriguing questions about habitat selection by this spider.",0

1 The spatial and temporal variations in aphidophagous syrphid abundance were recorded over two seasons in wildflower resource patches sown in a winter barley crop and associated field margins. Standard census techniques and sticky board trapping were used to assess numbers of syrphids, whilst weekly flower head counts were used to quantify the floral resources available in each of the patches.

2 The field margin supported a greater diversity and density of syrphids than the within-crop wildflower patches, despite having a relatively lower flower head density. Presumably this was in response to other resources that field margins offer, namely additional aphid resources, shelter from predation, lekking sites and suitable flight-paths.

3 The commonest species of syrphid, Episyrphus balteatus, demonstrated a very positive habitat association with the field margin and was rarely reported in the field patches. Therefore, it may be an unsuitable candidate for the biological control of aphids via augmentation of numbers using non-host resources.

4 Patch size and shape had little effect on the spatial distributions of syrphids, probably because of the adult syrphids' high mobility.

5 Of greater influence was the number of flowers contained in each habitat patch. Typically, patches with higher numbers of flowers had significantly greater aggregations of hoverflies. Habitat manipulation by the provision of flowers in patches seems to increase the local density of hoverflies. Further work is necessary to establish the importance of flower density in enhancing the control of pest populations.",1

The wild relatives of crop plants are an important source of genetic variation and can be used to introduce new traits into existing crops. Identification and conservation of crop wild relatives (CWR) is, therefore, an important step to safeguard future food security. Recent efforts have identified geographical hotspots of CWR diversity in several countries but, as yet, there have been no surveys to identify the habitats and landscape features within these areas that might be most suitable for conservation efforts. Here, we use a UK-wide vegetation survey covering a range of both habitats and landscape features (e.g. fields, hedgerows, waterways and roadsides) to identify the habitats and features with the highest proportion of CWR identified as priority taxa for conservation. Priority CWR were most abundant in grassland habitats, although this was most striking in CWR related to forage and fodder crops. CWR related to food crops were most common in cropped and weedy areas, fertile grassland and lowland woodland. Within habitats, CWR occurrence was significantly associated with linear features including hedgerows, roadsides, field boundaries and field margins. Our findings indicate that CWR of conservation interest are often associated with disturbed habitats and landscape features that are not considered as priorities under site-based conservation measures. We suggest that efforts to maintain linear features in hotspots of CWR diversity would be most effective at conserving the UK's CWR resource.",0

During the 2007-2009 breeding seasons, we located 387 nests in buffers of a northeast Mississippi agroecosystem. Dickcissel (Spiza americana) and red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) were the most common nesting species. Time since disturbance influenced nest densities of dickcissels and red-winged blackbirds; densities were lesser during the first growing season post- disturbance but increased during the second growing season post-burn. Nest densities for both species were least in buffers adjacent to woodland. Inclusion of disturbance did not improve models of dickcissel and red- winged blackbird nest survival, suggesting that disturbance influenced nesting density, but not nesting outcomes. Amount of grassland surrounding dickcissel nests was positively associated with nest survival, but confidence intervals included zero indicating effects were not strong. Although distance to nearest crop or developed edge were included in competing models of red-winged blackbird nest survival, their effects were negligible. Agricultural conservation buffers will best serve breeding grassland bird populations if they are established in areas with minimal woodland cover, maximize total grassland in the landscape, and are maintained with prescribed burning.

We planted prairie buffer strips in three designs, varying the proportion of the catchment converted to buffer and/or the continuity of the buffer. Within the catchments, we determined the identity and percent cover of buffer strip plant species during 2008–2011 and of weed species in cropped areas during 2009–2011. We found 380% more species in 6 m2 of buffer strip than in 6 m2 of crop, indicating that the presence of buffer strips greatly increased catchment diversity. Plant community composition did not differ among the three buffer designs. Despite being surrounded by cropland, the buffer vegetation was dominated by native perennial species—the targeted vegetation type for both ecohydrological functions (e.g., erosion control) and native species conservation—within four years of establishment. Furthermore, weed species richness and prevalence did not differ between cropped areas of catchments with buffer strips and cropped areas of catchments without buffer strips.

The STRIPs (Science-based Trials of Row crops Integrated with Prairies) project is a watershedscale experiment at the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge, in Jasper County, Iowa, US, in which strips of prairie vegetation were planted within watersheds of corn (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max) production to aid in soil and water conservation. The project includes 12 0.5to 3.2-ha watersheds. Nine watersheds included buffer strips in one of three design treatments that varied the number and position of strips and/or the proportion of the watershed converted to buffer and three watersheds were 100% crop. The present study investigated: (1) If the design of prairie buffer strips influenced their vegetation; (2) If the vegetation of prairie buffer strips shifted over time; (3) If prairie buffer strips caused a weed problem in adjacent crop fields. From 2008-2011, the identity and percent cover of plant species within the buffer strips were surveyed, and from 2009-2011, the identity and percent cover of weed species within the cropped areas of the watersheds were surveyed. Differences among treatments and among years in plant species diversity, percent cover, and composition were analyzed using ANOVA and NMS. The design of buffer strips did not influence plant species diversity or composition; however, buffer strip vegetation did shift over time. In 2008, the strips had 38 species (in 6 m) with 37% of the total plant cover composed of perennial species and 22% composed of native perennial species. By 2011, the strips had 55 species (in 6 m) with 90% of the total plant cover composed of perennial species and 58% composed of native perennial species. In addition, NMS analyses indicated that the buffer strip plant community shifted from annual to perennial species. Within the crop, weed species richness and percent cover did not differ among watershed treatments, regardless of whether watersheds contained buffer strips or not. Prairie buffer strips greatly increased plant diversity in the watersheds; 380% more species were found in 6 m of prairie buffer than in 6 m of cropland.

In this study we describe the effect of field margins on the diet of Eurasian Skylark nestlings and adults living on intensively managed Dutch farmland. We tested the hypotheses that field margins offer a higher diversity of invertebrate prey than intensively managed crops, and that the diet of nestlings receiving food from field margins will therefore be more diverse than that of other nestlings. Field margins had a greater variety of invertebrate prey groups to offer than the intensively managed crops. Coleoptera were the most frequently and most abundantly eaten prey group by both adults and nestlings. Together, Coleoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Araneae accounted for 91% of the nestling diet. Nestlings ate larger prey items and a larger proportion of larvae than adults. Almost 75% of both adults and nestlings consumed plant material, perhaps indicating a scarcity of invertebrate resources. When provided with food from field margins, the mean number of invertebrate orders in the nestling diet increased significantly from 4.7 to 5.5 and the number of families from 4.2 to 5.8 per sample. Thus, birds that used field margins for foraging could indeed provide their young with more invertebrate prey groups than birds only foraging in crops and grassland.",1

The aim of this study was to estimate the dispersal success of forest-dwelling plants from a stand into and along an attached woody corridor, and to explain the observed patterns from the point of view of species’ dispersal traits and corridor properties. We sampled 47 forest–corridor transects in the agricultural landscapes of southeastern Estonia. Regionally common forest-dwelling species (observed in at least 10 % of seed-source forests) were classified on the basis of their ecological response profile—forest-restricted species (F-type) and forest-dwelling generalists (G-type). Species richness and the proportion of F-type species decreased sharply from the seed-source forest core to the forest edge and to the first 10–15 m of the corridor, while G-type species richness remained constant throughout the transect. Corridor structure had a species-specific effect—F species were promoted by old (≥50 years) and wide (≥10 m) corridors, while G species were supported by young and narrow corridors with ditch-related soil disturbances. Moderate shade (canopy cover <75 %) was optimal for all forest-dwelling species. Large dispersule weight, and not seed weight, dispersal vector or Ellenberg’s indicator values, was the trait that differentiated F species from G species. We conclude that most woody corridors are only dispersal stepping-stone habitats for habitat generalist species, and not for specialists. Only century old corridors can relieve the dispersal limitation of forest-restricted species.",0

Three treatments have been tested: (1) cabbage adjacent to a wildflower strip, (2) cabbage near to a wildflower strip (>10 m up to 90 m), and (3 = control) cabbage without wildflower strip or any other semi-natural habitats nearby. Caterpillars and eggs of Mamestra brassicae, Pieris rapae, and Plutella xylostella (only larvae) have been sampled weekly in the unsprayed cabbage crops at 6 dates (cauliflower) and 9 dates (red cabbage). The parasitism rate of each pest species and its stage of development was recorded. Caterpillars of M. brassicae and P. rapae were parasitised at a higher rate in cabbage fields near to the wildflower strip. In contrast, caterpillars of P. xylostella were significantly more parasitised in the field without strip. The parasitism rate of eggs was relatively low in general (14-35%), but increased in the proximity of the strips. In addition, the diversity and abundance of parasitic wasp families (Hymenoptera parasitica) recorded by sweep net catches were much higher in wildflower strips (up to 3 fold more specimens than in cauliflower; 14-16 families) than in the cabbage crops (7-11 families). In conclusion, data of this on-farm trial indicate that wildflower strips enhance the diversity and abundance of parasitic wasps, and thus may improve parasitism of certain lepidopteran cabbage pests in adjacent fields.",1

This was undertaken in 24 wheat fields in 'coarse-grain' and 'fine- grain' landscapes in western France. A greater percentage of the latter landscape was covered by hedgerows and grassland and the total area covered by fields and the average size of the fields were smaller. 2 The effects on aphid abundance of the distance from field margins, the presence of grassy strips and carabid abundance were determined in both landscapes. 3 Both aphid species were more abundant in the 'fine-grain' landscape, which may have been a result of the higher density of semi-natural elements. In both types of landscape, the total numbers of aphids were negatively correlated with the distance from the field margin. This may have been because aphids were dispersing from overwintering sites in field margins. The abundance of M. dirhodum was strongly negatively correlated with the presence of grassy strips in the 'coarse- grain' landscape, although there were no such significant correlations for either of the aphid species in the 'fine-grain' landscape. 4 Aphid and carabid abundances were negatively correlated in the 'fine-grain' and positively in 'coarse-grain' landscape. 5 The results obtained in the present study emphasize the importance of semi-natural areas in agricultural landscapes in shaping the spatial distribution of aphids and carabid beetles, their natural enemies, at different spatial scales.",1

In Australia, farmers and natural resource managers are striving to enhance environmental outcomes at farm and catchment scales by planting streamside management zones (SMZs) on farms with trees and other perennial vegetation. Lack of sound information on and funding for establishing and managing trees in SMZs is hindering wide-scale adoption of this practice. Australian Codes of Forest Practice discourage or prevent harvesting of trees in SMZs of perennial streams. One concern is the potential effect of tree harvesting in SMZs on delivery of sediment to adjacent streams. The aims of this paper were to summarize the literature relevant to this concern and, in one case study in an agricultural context, to determine the effects on turbidity of harvesting a SMZ plantation.",1

The experimental factors investigated were location, vegetation and herbage removal. Margin strips were mown twice a year with a late first cut around 15 June and a regrowth cut around 15 September to meet nature conservation objectives. Average DM yield over the first three years was not significantly affected by herbage removal but increased significantly over time, irrespective of vegetation or herbage removal. Initially, sown margin strips significantly outyielded unsown margin strips, but differences in DM yield converged over time. The mid-June cut yielded significantly more than the regrowth cut but its herbage quality was significantly lower. Herbage from the unsown margin strip had a significantly better forage quality than herbage from sown margin strips. Forage quality decreased over time, irrespective of location or vegetation. Changes over time in DM yield and quality were attributed to changes in species composition. The herbage quality of field margins was lower than the herbage quality of intensively managed grassland, limiting its use in rations for highly productive livestock.",0

Best management practices for adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change include modifications to farm production through adjusted intensity and product types and changing land use through crop siting and tillage practices. Farmer perceptions of risk and profitability of best management practices are key determinants of adoption, which traditional incentive programs like the Environmental Quality Incentive Program attempt to address by providing financial and technical support. To ensure that payments offered through these programs that maximize adoption, regional incentive payments must be based upon locally established costs. This paper focuses on the cost of implementing and maintaining climate change specific best management practices (CCBMPs) for twelve diverse farms in Vermont. Specifically, three CCBMPs for Vermont are examined: cover cropping, management intensive rotational grazing (MIRG), and riparian buffer strips. Results show the average cost for cover cropping is $129.24/acre, MIRG is $79.82/acre, and a tree based riparian buffer strip cost $807.33/acre. We conclude that existing incentive payments for cover cropping and MIRG are below costs, likely resulting in under-adoption.",0

It would be possible to largely eliminate natural resource degeneration through judicious application of on-farm conservation practices. Farmers have little economic incentive to conserve because, according to previous research, most conservation techniques have been demonstrated to be unprofitable. The empirical research into three alternative types of conservation practices for this study confirms that two (conservation crops and riparian buffer strips) provide for net costs to farmers, and that the third (conservation soil tillage) is not profitable under all circumstances. At the same time, the research shows that two out of the three sets of practices, namely riparian buffer strips and conservation tillage, can be economically beneficial to society as a whole. This raises the question of whether and to what extent society, as economic gainers, should offer compensation to farmers as economic losers. This study furthermore establishes that not all conservation practices that result in reduced soil erosion will lead to decreased sediment and phosphorus loadings into watercourses; that not all reduced sediment and phosphorus loadings lead to improved water quality; and that, even where an improvement to water quality in chemical, physical, biological and aesthetic terms can be obtained, the costs to society of achieving improvement may exceed the economic benefits. Such outcomes can readily promote disagreements between environmentalists and ecologists on the one hand and socio-economists on the other. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",1

The species richness and abundance of heteropteran bugs in twenty 1- to 4-year-old wildflower areas and winter wheat fields were compared, and the effects of succession in the wildflower areas investigated. Vegetation and environmental parameters (plant species richness, vegetation structure, flower abundance, field size, surrounding landscape) and their effects on bug species were explored. Total species richness and abundance of bugs were significantly lower in wheat fields than in wildflower areas but did not differ in the wildflower areas of different ages. The numbers of zoophagous bugs in the wildflower areas were positively correlated with the age of the wildflower areas. Correspondence analysis showed that the bug species composition in the winter wheat fields was very similar but strongly separated from that in the wildflower areas. The species composition of bugs in the wildflower areas became increasingly dissimilar with advancing successional age. In a partial canonical correspondence analysis, the bug assemblage was significantly associated with the number of perennial plant species, the number of annual plant species and vegetation structure, which accounted for 13.4%, 12.6% and 7.2% of the variance, respectively. As wildflower areas clearly increased heteropteran diversity on arable land and bug species composition changed with increasing successional stage, the establishment of a mosaic of wildflower areas of different age is recommended as it enables the survival of heteropteran bugs with different life history traits.",0

Lower amounts of pesticides leached through grass-cover soil columns (2.7–24.3% of the initial amount) than the bare soil columns (8.0–55.1%), in correspondence with their sorption coefficients. Diuron was recovered in higher amounts in leachates (8.9–32.2%) than tebuconazole (2.7–12.9%), in agreement with their sorption coefficients. However, despite having a sorption coefficient similar to that of diuron, more procymidone was recovered in the leachates (10.2–55.1%), probably due to its facilitated transport by dissolved organic matter. Thus even in this very permeable soil, higher organic matter contents associated with grass-cover reduce the amount of pesticide leaching and limit the risk of groundwater contamination by the pesticides. The results of diuron and tebuconazole transfer through undisturbed buffer zone soil columns are in agreement with field observations on the buffer zone.",1

(3) In a multiple regression analysis the amount of dead grass present in the base of the hedge was the best predictor of grey partridge breeding density within farms after the length of the field boundary was taken into account. A similar analysis for red-legged partridges showed that the amount of nettle present at the base of field boundaries was the only variable related to breeding density after the overall length was taken into account. Between farms, the breeding density of both species was unrelated to the hedgerow characteristics. (4) The importance of hedges and hedgerow management to partridges is discussed.

Margin plots were regenerated spontaneously or were sown to grass/forb mixtures and were managed under a cutting regime with removal of cuttings. In general, soil nitrate N, soil ammonium N and soil mineral N losses were significantly affected by distance from the field crop edge and not by plant community type. The further away from the crop edge, the lower soil nitrate (up to fivefold lower than in the crop) was found in the margin strip, but soil ammonium N was approximately 50% higher close to nearby trees and shrubs. Inside the margin strip, total soil mineral N as well as N loss during winter was minimal at a distance of 5 m from the crop edge. The reduction of soil nitrate N near the boundary by the presence of a margin strip was responsible for the increase in abundance of less competitive species and for an up to 20% higher species-richness within the field boundaries. In summary, our results show clearly that margin strips both decrease N pollution of groundwater and increase botanical diversity. A minimal margin width of 5 m is recommended.",0

Moreover, different ways of mitigating the losses in a boreal climate are discussed. Studies were conducted in 1996-2008 at Jokioinen, Tohmajarvi, Ruukki and Taivalkoski.

Water samples representing surface runoff were collected from open ditches and analysed e.g. for total solids (sediment) as well as total P (TP), dissolved reactive P (DRP) and total N (TN) to estimate nutrient losses from forested feedlots with different stocking rates (animal units per hectare, AU/ha) and from slurry-amended grass. Surface runoff samples were similarly analysed to evaluate the efficacy of 10 m wide buffer zones to decrease and retain nutrient losses from pasture and tilled soil. The soil was sampled for plant-available P and mineral nitrogen (SMN) analyses.

Fairly high TP (0,9-1,4 kg/ha/yr) and TN (4-16 kg/ha/yr) losses occurred in ditch water from forested feedlots where cattle has been reared for 1-3 years. These amounts correspond to the annual losses from cropped felds. The plant-available P (up to 20 mg/L) in surface soil and the amount of SMN (up to 100-400 kg/ha) in the 60 cm deep soil layer were highest in places where the cattle gathered, such as bedded and feeding areas (called high-input areas).

High losses of TP and DRP (4,4 and 3,6 kg/ha/yr, respectively) also occured in surface runoff from the grass fields where surface application of slurry (40 t/ha) in autumn was followed by rainfall. Injection of the slurry into the soil decreased TP and DRP losses by 79 and 86 %, respectively.

The buffer zones along watercourses were less important in the grazed field than in autumn-tilled soil due to the smaller erosion and nutrient losses from grass than from tilled soil. The surface runoff losses of sediment, TP and TN decreased by more than 50, 30 and 50 %, respectively, by buffer zones on tilled soil.",0

When rain falls on burnt pastures, it can lead to increased pollutant transport in runoff. However, this transport can be modified by vegetative buffers which intercept the runoff downslope of burnt areas. This study examines the effects of different pasture buffer lengths (0, 2, and 5 m) on sediment and chemical transport from two pasture sites near Wivenhoe Dam, the main water reservoir for Brisbane City. Simulated rainfall (100 mm/h) was applied to 18 plots on pasture sites after they were burnt, and insoluble and soluble components were measured in the runoff. Most eroded sediment/organic debris accumulated against the first row of the grass buffer strips or was deposited in the upslope backwater region. Buffer length had little impact on the runoff concentrations of NO3– and NO2– (NOx), total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and total nitrogen from the 5-m-length upslope plots but was significant for sediment loss rate, filterable reactive phosphate, ammonium, and total and dissolved organic carbon. Pasture type was significant for NOx, ammonium, sediment loss rate, and total organic carbon only. Burning increased enrichment ratios of nutrients and carbon in the runoff compared with unburnt plots, but a 2-m buffer strip subsequently reduced the enrichment ratio values by >30%. Buffers strips of unburnt pasture grass may provide an effective tool for post-fire erosion control following prescribed burning; however, further work including scaling to larger plot sizes and catchment level is required.",0

P. neoaphidis was able to infect the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, when maintained under controlled conditions that simulated those that occur seasonally in the UK. Although there was a significant inverse relationship between temperature and time-to-kill, with death occurring after 4.2, 6.9 and 13.6 days when maintained under fluctuating summer, autumn and winter temperatures, respectively, there were no additional statistically significant effects of photoperiod. The activity of inoculum on soil was indirectly assessed by baiting with A. pisum. Under controlled conditions P. neoaphidis remained active on soil and was able to infect aphids for up to 80 days. However, the percentage of aphids that became infected decreased from 76% on day 1 to 11% on day 80. Whereas there was little difference in the activity of conidia that had been maintained at 4 degrees C and 10 degrees C, activity at 18 degrees C was considerably reduced. Under field conditions the activity of inoculum was strongly influenced by season. On day 49 there was little or no activity during spring, summer or winter. However, during autumn a mean proportion of 0.08 aphids still became infected with P. neoaphidis. Margin type did not affect the activity of conidia nor was there a difference in activity between blocks that had regenerated naturally and those that had been planted. These results suggest that P. neoaphidis can infect aphids and remain active on soil under the abiotic conditions that occur seasonally in the UK and that this fungus may be able to persist annually without a resting stage.",1

Government sponsored programs like the Cropland Reserve Program generally require the planting of specifi c vegetative spe- cies during buffer restoration, although the effectiveness of such an approach when compared to restoration by volunteer species is unknown. We studied the effect of differences in vegetation structure on avian habitat in riparian buffer zones. A 25 m (82 ft) wide planted woodland buffer, 30 m (98 ft) wide grass, shrub, and woodland three-zone buffer, and a 9 m (30 ft) wide shrub buffer were evaluated for habitat potential using breeding-bird counts and vegetation surveys. Bird density and spe- cies richness varied with the structure of the vegetative communities present at the three sites. Avian species richness and total detections were higher in the three-zone buffer than in both the shrub and planted buffer, likely a result of the diversity of vegetation at the site. These data suggest that restoration of riparian areas by allow- ing fallow vegetation to recolonize is at the very least equally benefi cial to avian wildlife as is restoration by planting specifi c grass, shrub, and tree species. Buffer restoration by natural revegetation using this method could be recommended as an alternative to implementation by planting riparian species due to its simplicity and cost effectiveness.",0

The study was carried out in 1998-2006 and covered four shelterbelts (planted in 1993-1996) located in the area of the Dezydery Chlapowski Landscape Park (western part of Poland). The shelterbelts were colonized by macrofungi just after planting. During first years of their growth a total of 174 species were recorded. Species composition changed significantly between ini- tial (1998-2000) and final (2004-2006) period of study. Similarity of macrofungi communi- ties (expressed as the Sorensen's index) between these two periods in studied shelterbelts ranged between 37 and 46%. In spite of high similarity in tree species composition between studied af- forestations (69-80%), the communities of mac- rofungi differed strongly between these sam- pling plots (Sorensen's index was equal to about 40%). Pattern of changes in percentage share of functional groups, i.e. parasitic, mycorrhizal and saprotrophs (humicolous, lignicolous, litter- inhibiting and muscicolous ones) in individual afforestations was different but the diversity of the communities measured with the Shannon- Weaver H' index on the basis of share of func- tional groups tended to increase with ageing of afforestations. On average, the share of fungi growing on soil (ectomycorrhizal and humico- lous saprotrophic species) was highest among all distinguished groups. Species composition of particular functional group was changing dur- ing the study period. A species representing new groups (lignicolous saprotrophs and parasites) were appearing in some shelterbelts in successive years. There were recorded some species rare in Poland, eg. Psilocybe (Stropharia) melanosperma (Bull. ex Pers.: Fr.) Noordel., Clavariadelphus fistulosus (Holmsk.: Fr.) Corner, Thelephora caryophyllea (Schaeff.): Fr., Agrocybe arvalis (Fr.)

Quel., Psilocybe (Stropharia) inuncta (Fr.: Fr.) Noordel., Trichophaea gregaria (Rehm) Boud. and Typhula filata (Pers.) Herter. Occur- rence of rare and threatened species in young shelterbelts indicates that such afforestations, planted in crop fields but not treated by agricul- tural practices, contribute to the protection of species richness of macrofungi associated with tree communities and they are important substi- tute habitats for many species.",0

However, the experimental evidence on their effectiveness (BSE) has been from sloping locations with shallow flow and surface runoff. The aim of this experimental study was to quantify BSE for P on flat agricultural lowland, predominantly with deep flow. We selected sites characteristic of five major hydrogeological classes in the Netherlands and in each experimental field installed paired 5-m-wide unfertilized grass (BS) and reference treatments (REF) that abutted the ditch. The REF treatments were managed similar to the adjacent grass or maize field, but BS treatments were only harvested. Each treatment had a reservoir in the ditch to collect and measure discharge and flowproportional P concentration for 3 or 4 yr. We also measured net P withdrawal, the P status of the soil and P concentration in upper groundwater. We found a significant BSE for P of 61% on the site with the shallowest flow and steepest slope (2%). At the other sites, BSE was low and statistically insignificant. We conclude that harvested unfertilized buffer strips reduce P loads from flat fields only in specific areas with high surface runoff and ⁄ or shallow flow, especially in combination with a high original soil P status.",0

Research was conducted in 2006 to 2008 to evaluate the size of cool season grass filters consisting primarily of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb) with some orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata L.) relative to drainage area size in reducing runoff sediment and phosphorus (P). The soil was Pohocco silt loam Typic Eutro- chrepts with a median slope of 5.5 %. The grass filters occupying 1.1 and 4.3 % of the plot area were compared with no filter with four replica- tions. The filters were planted in the V-shaped plot outlets which were 3.7×11.0 m in size. The filter effect on sediment and P concentration was deter- mined from four natural runoff events when nearly all plots had runoff. Filter effect on runoff volume and contaminant load was determined using total runoff and composites of samples collected from 12 runoff events. Sediment concentration was re- duced by 25 %w ith filters compared with no filter (from 1.10 to 1.47 gL −1 ), but P concentration was not affected. The 1.1 and 4.3 % filters, respective- ly, compared with having no grass filter, reduced: runoff volume by 54 and 79 %; sediment load by 67 and 84 % (357 to 58 kgha −1 ); total P load by 68 and 76 %( 0.58 to 0.14 kgha −1 ); particulate P (PP) load by 66 and 82 %( 0.39 to 0.07 kgha −1 ); and dissolved reactive P (DRP) load by 73 and 66 % (0.2 to 0.07 kgha −1 ), respectfully. A snowmelt runoff event had 56 % greater DRP concentration compared with rainfall-induced runoff events.

Secondary functions include reducing runoff volume and velocity and retaining sediments and harmful substances from adjacent fields. Grass cover (sward)-damaging sedimentation in the GWW is commonly reduced by frequent mowing, but in doing so the effectiveness of the waterway relative to the secondary functions is reduced. Our objectives were to (i) evaluate whether the maintenance of a GWW can be reduced if on-site erosion control is effective, (ii) measure the effectiveness of such a GWW, and (iii) analyze the underlying mechanisms. A long-term (1994-2000) landscape experiment was performed in four watersheds, where two had GWWs for which maintenance was largely neglected. An intensive soil conservation system was established on all fields. Runoff and sediment delivery were continuously measured in the two watersheds with GWWs and in their paired watersheds that were similar, but without GWWs. Runoff was reduced by 90 and 10% for the two sets of paired watersheds, respectively. The different efficiencies of the GWWs resulted from different layouts (doubled width and flat-bottomed vs. v-shaped drainageway). The GWWs reduced sediment delivery by 97 and 77%, respectively, but the sward was not damaged by sedimentation. Grain sizes > 50 microm were settled due to gravity in both GWWs. Smaller grain sizes were primarily settled due to infiltration, which increased with a more effective runoff reduction. In general, the results indicated a high potential of GWWs for reducing runoff volume and velocity, sediments, and agrochemicals coming from agricultural watersheds.",1

At one well-drained site with a 100 m buffer, little or no effect was detected on surface-water quality by discharging ground water because extensive woody vegetation in the buffer was able to take up not only most nitrate, but also most ground water before discharging to the stream during the growing season (March-October). At the second well-drained site, ground water discharging to the stream from the side with a buffer contained about 2 mg/L of nitrate-nitrogen after passing through the bed of the stream compared to 6 mg/L in ground water discharging from the side with no buffer. In the poorly drained settings, nitrate in ground water decreased from about 6 mg/L in the recharge area to less than 0.02 mg/L downgradient from the riparian buffer. Ground water discharging from the side with no buffer contained 0.83 mg/L. Riparian buffers appear effective in reducing nitrate in ground water discharging to Coastal Plain streams.",1

To better understand
these processes, a runoff study was conducted to evaluate vegetated buffer strips performance in reducing atrazine,
metolachlor, and chlorpyrifos transport as affected by the drainage area to buffer strip area ratio. The simulated runoff water
mixed with pesticide–treated soil was distributed onto six vegetated buffer strips, each 1.52 m wide . 20.12 m long, located
downslope of the inflow distribution tank in a well established vegetated grassed waterway. These strips provided for three
replications of two inflow rates designated as “drainage area/buffer strip area ratio treatments” of 15:1 and 30:1. Infiltration
for the 15:1 treatment averaged 38.8% of the inflow volume, whereas it averaged 30.4% for the 30:1 treatment. Sediment
retention efficiencies averaged 90.1% and 86.8% for the 15:1 and 30:1 treatments, respectively. Concentrations of atrazine
and metolachlor associated with sediment outflows from the strips were larger than their respective inflow concentrations,
while the results were opposite for chlorpyrifos. Concentrations in runoff water for both atrazine and metolachlor in outflow
from the strips were smaller than the inflow concentrations; again, the results were opposite for chlorpyrifos. The 15:1
treatment retained an average of 52.5% of the total input of atrazine, 54.4% of metolachlor, and 83.1% of chlorpyrifos.
Corresponding numbers for the 30:1 treatment were 46.8% for atrazine, 48.1% for metolachlor, and 76.9% for chlorpyrifos.
Analysis of variance using the randomized block design showed that differences of percent retention of pesticide between
treatments were not significant for any of the three pesticides at the 10% significance level. A lack of significant difference
indicates either a need for more than three replications and/or larger area ratio treatments to be studied. The results of this
study indicate that a 30:1 area ratio buffer strip could perform equally as well as a 15:1 area ratio buffer strip. Thus, less
land would be required under buffer strips to get the desired results.",0

Five rice plots located on the Rice Research Station in Crowley, LA represented the different MP's to be evaluated. The five water seeding MP's were: a.1‐no till; a.2‐water cultivation with 30‐day settling; a.3‐dry cultivation with clear water planting; a.4‐mudding‐in with vegetated filter, and b‐mudding‐in (control).

To determine the risk insecticides pose to quail, we quantified exposure rates and hazard, Exposure rate depends on quail habitat use in relation to insecticide applications, whereas hazard depends on susceptibility to a toxin and the dose an individual receives, Because providing early-successional vegetation around row-crop fields is a typical habitat management recommendation, we determined rates of exposure of quail and their broods to insecticides applied to soybean fields with and without vegetated field borders, Radiocollared quail (n = 69) used soybean fields extensively (64% of telemetry locations) at the time of year insecticides were applied. Quail used soybean fields twice as often when vegetated borders surrounded crop fields (P = 0.04). Ten of 18 broods monitored by telemetry were located in soybean fields 88% of the time. In 1993. 4 of 6 broods 0.49). However, ChE activity was depressed (P < 0.001) and body mass was lower (P = 0.02) in chicks exposed to methyl parathion, which historically (pre-1980) received significant use in production of row crops in North Carolina. Our results, along with data on use and toxicity of other insecticides applied to row crops, collectively suggest direct affects to survival of quail chicks from use of foliar-applied insecticides does not explain reduced quail densities on agricultural landscapes.",0

Denitrification in riparian buffer strips is thought to be the major process -with nitrate uptake by plant growth- that reduces nitrate input in surface water. We investigated the Denitrifier Enzyme Activity (DEA) to test how the buffer strip management modifies the denitrification process. The experimental site is composed of a crop field and a 11 m wide grassed buffer strip at the border between the crop field and a tributary to the Attert river, South-East Belgium. Soil samples from the crop field and the buffer strip have been submitted to different imposed conditions combining glucose, nitrate and water saturation to investigate how antecedent water regime, nitrate and carbon content affect denitrification. The work included DEA measurements on undisturbed soil cores freshly sampled. Experiments on undisturbed soil cores identify the buffer strip as more effective in denitrification (p < 0.001) than the cropped field. However, experiments on samples conditioned under imposed carbon and/or nitrate contents emphasised the importance of micro-topography.",0

It is unknown how such a GWW affects the loading of surface runoff with dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP). The effect on DRP was tested in a landscape-scale study where DRP concentrations and loads in surface runoff were measured in two watersheds in which GWWs were newly installed and increased in effectiveness over time. Both watersheds were compared with paired watersheds without GWW installation; all watersheds were continuously monitored over 5 yr (1993-1997). Additionally, DRP concentrations were measured in open field and throughfall precipitation under growing grass and crops in field experiments, and DRP concentrations in surface runoff from straw covered surfaces were determined with laboratory rainfall simulation experiments. Dissolved reactive P in throughfall for the different cover types was highly variable, and the highest concentrations (up to 2.8 mg L(-1)) occurred especially during flowering of the respective crop and after frost events. Dissolved reactive P concentrations in runoff from straw-covered surfaces were slightly higher compared with those from bare soil. On average, there was a small difference in DRP concentrations between throughfall under growing crops and grass and in runoff from bare or straw covered soil surfaces. Hence, the introduction of a relatively small grassed area has little effect on the DRP concentration in surface runoff from the total watershed. This finding was supported by the watershed data, where watersheds with and without GWW showed similar DRP concentrations. No change in DRP concentrations occurred over the 5-yr period. Such GWWs will thus reduce the DRP load analogously to the reduction in total surface runoff.",1

A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was built to investigate the effects of field boundary vegetation types on the abundance of S. rubrovittatus. Intensive mowing in June of immediate and surrounding rice field boundaries containing flowering host plants of S. rubrovittatus, such as Lolium multiflorum Lam. and other poaceous plants, is the key to reducing the total abundance of S. rubrovittatus.

Although agricultural intensification has led to a scarcity of native grassland habitats within most agricultural landscapes of North America, fragmented remnants and semi-natural habitats may support diverse communities, including butterflies, as long as vital resources such as host plants are available. The United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Conservation Reserve Program practice CP33 Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds (USDA 2004) provides semi-natural grassland habitat in agricultural landscapes, but a knowledge gap exists about impacts of prescribed disturbance (e.g. burning or disking) on butterflies. We monitored butterfly habitat and butterfly communities on experimentally manipulated CP33 grassland buffers in Clay County, Mississippi from 2007 to 2009. Disturbance guild butterfly species richness did not differ among treatments. However, disturbance guild abundance was positively affected by disking in both the first and second growing seasons following disking, and the magnitude of this response varied between years. Effects of burning on disturbance guild abundance did not differ from the control treatment. There were no treatment differences for grassland guild butterfly abundance and species richness suggesting that periodic disturbance does not unduly impact grassland-associated butterflies in the southeastern US. Our results support current USDA practice standards that require periodic disturbance during the 10-year contract, but restrict the disturbance to 1/3 or 1/4 of grassland buffer area in a given year.",0

Agricultural conservation practices such as native perennial vegetation (NPV) strips will influence carbon cycling of an upland agroecosystem, and could affect how much DOC enters streams in runoff, potentially affecting aquatic ecosystems. In a study conducted in Iowa (USA), four treatments with strips of NPV varying in slope position and proportion of area were randomly assigned among 12 small agricultural watersheds in a balanced incomplete block design. Runoff samples from 2008 to 2010 were analyzed for DOC and correlated with flow data to determine flow weighted DOC concentrations and loads. Data were analyzed for the entire 3 years, annually, seasonally, monthly, by flow event size and for one extreme storm event. Overall we found few differences in DOC concentration with the exception that concentrations were greater in the 10 % NPV at the footslope watersheds than the 20 % NPV in contours watersheds over the 3 years, and the 100 % agricultural treatment had higher DOC concentrations than all NPV treatments during the one extreme event. Because the NPV treatments reduced runoff, DOC export tended to be highest in the 100 % agricultural watersheds over the 3 years and during high flows. We also compared two watersheds that were restored to 100 % NPV and found decreases in DOC concentrations and loads indicating that complete conversion to prairie leads to less watershed DOC export. Regression results also support the contention that increases in the percentage of NPV in the watershed decreases watershed export of DOC. Further analysis indicated that DOC concentrations were diluted as flow event size increased, independent of any treatment effects. It appears groundwater sources become an important component to flow as flow event size increases in these watersheds.",0

Hedges represent a new and undisturbed habitat for those polyphagous predators and may provide increased prey availability. Carabids were sampled with pitfall traps in a hedge and an adjacent cultivated field during the whole activity period of these insects to assess the effect of distance from the hedge on species diversity. Fenced pitfall traps were also used to estimate absolute population densities. Several diversity indices were calculated at various sampling levels (total area, distance treatment, trap). Kendall's coefficient of rank correlation between communities at adjacent distances showed that the greatest changes in species relative abundances occurred close to the hedge. Indices of species richness, dominance concentration, equitability and Fisher's a all indicated a significant decrease in species diversity with increasing distance from the hedge. These trends are explained by two complementary factors. First, the number of species decreased significantly with distance from the centre of the hedge. Second, the various species had different spatial patterns of total capture and absolute density. Four groups of species can thus be distinguished: species restricted to the hedge, species preferring the hedge, species preferring the crop, and species unaffected by the hedge. The respective roles of small-scale abiotic changes in habitat structure and differences in prey availability are discussed.",0

The effects of two pesticide regimes (conventional and reduced) on spiders were contrasted with effects of two types of cultivation systems (customary and integrated farming practice). The plots under the conventional pesticide regime were sprayed with herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and growth regulators annually. The plots on reduced pesticide regime were treated only when the control thresholds were exceeded (in 1992 with insecticide and in 1994 with herbicide). The perennial grass strips (sown with a mixture of timothy, meadow fescue, red clover and white clover) at the margins of the treated plots provided an additional element. Seasonal patterns of spider catches were quite synchronous in the field and in the perennial strip. Number of spiders were clearly higher in perennial strips than in the field. Furthermore, the composition of spider fauna differed between cerela plots and perennial grass strips. Lycosidae dominated in grass strips, whereas in cereal fields the family Linyphiidae was common. The dominance of Lycosidae in grass strips increased from year to year. The perennial strips affected the spider abundance of the field; total spider catches and Lycosidae catches, but not Linyphiidae, in pitfalls near the strips were higher than in pitfalls situated further away. However, the effects of pesticide treatments on spider numbers did not depend on the distance from the perennial strip. Reduced pesticide use plots had greater total spider catches than conventional plots in 1992 and 1994. In both years the difference was obvious for more than 3 weeks after insecticide (dimethoate) treatment. In 1992, pirimicarb was nearly harmless to spiders compared to dimethoate. In 1994, the dimethoate treatment (in June) did not decrease clearly the abundance of spiders, but deltamethrin treatment (in July) had dramatic effects on the total spider abundance and the difference was still obvious in the last sampling period. At family level, the effects of pesticide treatments varied between families. Statistically significant differences between pesticide treatments were found in all years in Linyphiidae numbers, but in Lycosidae only in 1994. During the period of 3 years, no differences were found in the numbers of spiders between the two cultivation systems tested.",0

Yet, despite this constituting a major land-use change, surprisingly little is known about the effects of these strips on riparian organisms. We investigated the effect that widespread adoption of buffer strips may have on activity density, species diversity, and assemblage composition of ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae).
Over 2 years, we sampled carabids from 41 riparian margins within two river catchments in north-east Scotland. We compared three types of riparian margin: unbuffered (i.e. ‘unimproved’), vegetated buffer strips, and wooded, the latter acting as reference sites. A range of site parameters including characteristics of soil, water, and vegetation were recorded and the extent to which they correlated with ground beetle assemblages was explored.
Catchment and treatment effects were detected on ground beetle activity density and species diversity with unbuffered sites showing higher activity density and species richness. The assemblage structure differed according to catchment, treatment, and local characteristics. Multivariate analysis suggested that soil and vegetation parameters and stream width, together with buffer strip age and length were determinants of assemblage structure. Few riparian species were found in large numbers.
This study shows that in intensively managed agricultural landscapes riparian buffer strips do not create the quality of habitat required by truly riparian species. They do, however, provide habitat for woodland and stenotopic species and with more careful planning could play a role in increasing habitat heterogeneity at a landscape scale.",0

As a result, most headwater streams show structurally degraded channels, lacking riparian buffer zones, which are heavily loaded with nutrients from the surrounding crop fields. The present study examines whether longitudinally restricted riparian forest buffers can enhance the in-stream nutrient retention in nutrient-enriched headwater streams. We estimated nutrient uptake from pairwise, short-term addition experiments with NH, NH, PO, and NaCl within reaches with riparian forest buffers (RFB) and degraded reaches (DEG) of the same streams. Riparian forest buffers originated from the conservation of the pristine vegetation or from restoration measures. Hydrologic retention was calculated with the model OTIS-P on the basis of conductivity break-through curves from the salt injections. A significant increase in surface transient storage was revealed in pristine and restored RFB reaches compared with DEG reaches due to the longitudinal step-pool pattern and the frequent occurrence of woody debris on the channel bed. Ammonium uptake lengths were significantly shorter in RFB reaches than in DEG reaches, resulting from the higher hydrologic retention. Uptake velocities did not differ significantly between RFB and DEG reaches, indicating that riparian forest buffers did not affect the biochemical nutrient demand. Uptake of NH was mainly driven by autotrophs. Net PO uptake was not affected by riparian forest buffers. The study shows that the physical and biogeochemical effects of riparian forest buffers on the in-stream nutrient retention are limited in the case of highly eutrophic streams.",1

Achieving this goal requires an ability to balance avian benefits with agronomics, which may be facilitated by understanding how bird communities respond to various conservation practices. We evaluated bird richness, abundance, Shannon diversity, and Total Avian Conservation Value in 20 replicates of four Conservation Reserve Program practices in an intensive rowcrop agricultural landscape in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley from May–Jul., 2005–2007. Conservation practices included: (1) large blocks of structurally-diverse early-succession vegetation (6–8 y old trees) and three buffer types; (2) 30 m wide monotypic filter strips with tall dense switchgrass (Panicum virgatum); (3) 30 m wide diverse filter strips with a forb-native warm season grass mixture; and (4) 60 m wide early-succession riparian forest buffers (1–3 y old trees). The breeding bird community was dominated by red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus; 43% of total) and dickcissels (Spiza americana; 42% of total) but commonly included eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea), mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). We observed ≥1.8 × more dickcissels in large blocks and diverse filter strips than other buffers and greater Shannon diversity in large blocks than any buffers (P < 0.05). Diverse filter strips had ≥1.6 × greater overall bird density (7.2 birds/0.6 ha), on average, than all other practices. Based on these data, we conclude that buffers are attractive to farmland breeding birds and may provide important ecological benefits to supplement a conservation management system founded on large blocks of early-succession vegetation.",0

This study tested the hypothesis that the absence or presence of shelter belts (one or two) in paddocks decreases fence-line pacing and associated soil and water quality impacts. Soils near the fence line and in the rest of the paddock, in paddocks containing zero, one or two shelter belts, were sampled for bulk density and macroporosity (pores > 30 μm diameter). Large intact samples (1 x 0.2 x 0.1 m 3 ) were used to generate overland flow via rainfall simulation. The flow was tested for nutrients [phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) fractions], suspended sediment (SS), and the faecal indicator bacteria, Escherichia coli. Results showed that bulk density, void volume, SS, particulate P and total P were affected by location (fence line or rest of paddock) but, along with all other measurements except E. coli, were not affected by the number of shelter belts. Thus, the inclusion of shelter had no effect on the concentration of contaminant lost in overland flow or any soil physical or hydrological parameter, but decreased the run-off of E. coli. The lack of contrast between the location of soils can be partly attributed to the soil type (Brown, NZ soil classification, USDA Taxonomy: Typic Fragiudalf), which when compared with past studies was less erosive and lost less P into solution. Other factors may have been different management or the lesser impact of weaners compared with older hinds and stags on soil properties. Although only E. coli concentrations were decreased by the inclusion of shelter, factors such as improved production and animal welfare weigh heavily in favour of installing and maintaining shelter on deer farms. However, the environmental benefit of shelter should be tested in other farms where factors such as slope, soil, climate and farm management may increase the contrast with no shelter.",1

Much of this snow is transported by wind, causing substantial sublimation losses, which are reduced by obstacles and topographic features on the landscape that reduce snow transport and trap snow. Agroforestry configurations trap snow and reduce the amount and distance of snow movement and, because of this, reduce the amount of moisture lost to sublimation. The planning of agroforestry measures should therefore take into account their effects on snow hydrology. In this study, the effects of shelterbelts on snow quantity and distribution are shown over multiple years, including a number of locations in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Results show that snow transport reached equilibrium in 400 m or less (i.e., that sublimation rates were at their maximum beyond 400 m leeward of a shelterbelt). Also, in a paired landscape inventory, the landscape with shelterbelts had 29% more snow water equivalent (SWE) than the unsheltered landscape. Site-specific meteorological data was used in the Prairie Blowing Snow Model, now a component of the Cold Regions Hydrological Model, to calculate the effects of agroforestry configurations on snow water conservation. Modeled snow distribution agreed well with measured snow at Conquest, Saskatchewan, in the winter of 2009/2010. Using actual weather data for the same location for the period 1996–2011, the model calculated the annual sublimation from 200 m wide fields protected by shelterbelts to be up to 12.5 mm less than similar unsheltered fields.",0

We located 16 plots at intervals of 500 m along the shelterbelt and characterized both horizontal and vertical structure of each plot. Wind speed was measured within each plot and at different distances windward and leeward. We found that wind shelter effects were closely related to stand structure of the studied M. glyptostroboides shelterbelt. Stands with high basal area but intermediate crown index and intermediate proportion of large trees (LT) produced the best shelter effects, with significantly longer shelter distance (d70, shelter distance which the wind speed U does not exceed 70 % of U
 0) and slightly lower minimum relative wind speed (U

 0). Simple structural indices that can be easily measured in the field were good predictors of the shelter effect. LT was the best predictor of d70, while basal area at ground level was the best predictor of U

 0. The relationships between stand structure and shelter effect provides a practical guideline to the design, construction and management of forest shelterbelts. In order to provide the best shelter effects, high basal area of >50 m2 ha−1 at ground level or >33 m2 ha−1 at breast height coupled with an intermediate LT value of about 60 % should be maintained for the studied M. glyptostroboides shelterbelt.",0

Sampling was stratified from the field border or edge in each field in an attempt to elucidate any edge effects that might have occurred. Early season thrips populations appeared to be unaffected by the presence of a border. Pitfall sampling disclosed no differences in ground-dwelling predaceous arthropods but did detect increased populations of crickets around fields with borders. Cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii Glover) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) populations were too low during the study to adequately assess border effects. Heliothines, Heliothis virescens (F.) and Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), egg numbers and damage rates were largely unaffected by the presence or absence of a border, although in one instance egg numbers were significantly lower in fields with borders. Overall, foliage-dwelling predaceous arthropods were somewhat more abundant in fields with borders than in fields without borders. Tarnished plant bugs, Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois) (Heteroptera: Miridae) were significantly more abundant in fields with borders, but stink bugs, Acrosternum hilare (Say), and Euschistus servus (Say) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) numbers appeared to be largely unaffected by border treatment.

In this study, we analyzed the effects of wildflower strips (WFS) at the field scale and in the landscape context on butterflies in a Swiss arable landscape. Three hypotheses were tested: (1) butterfly diversity and abundance are higher in WFS than in conventional fields; (2) butterfly diversity and abundance are enhanced by the amount, proximity and connectivity of WFS in the landscape context; (3) additional factors influence butterfly diversity and abundance according to individual site conditions and landscape context characteristics linked to other landscape elements. WFS had more species and individuals of butterflies than conventional habitats. However, promoted species were mainly generalists; few specialists were enhanced. The diversity of all butterflies and of generalists increased linearly with percent cover of WFS, reflecting an effect of restoration measures depending on the landscape context. The influence of proximity and connectivity of WFS were, however, not significant. The occurrence of specialists was conditioned by plant species richness, while the effect of WFS for overall diversity was affected by the amount of grassland in the surroundings. We conclude that to increase the effectiveness of biodiversity-orientated restoration measures, their implementation should be steered toward increasing the share of WFS in the landscape. However, the combination of WFS with additional restoration measures might be needed to halt the decline of specialist species.",0

Installation of vegetated buffers on loamy soils dramatically reduced the bacterial contamination of runoff water from manure-treated pasturelands, but the size of the vegetated buffer was not an important determinant of bacterial removal efficiency. Only 10% of the runoff samples collected from treatment cells having vegetated buffers exhibited FCB concentrations >200 colony forming units (cfu)/100 mL (a common water quality standard value), and the median concentration for all cells containing vegetated buffers was only 6 cfu/100 mL. The presence of a vegetated buffer of any size, from 1 to 25 m, generally reduced the median FCB concentration in runoff by more than 99%. Results for FCB load calculations were similar. Our results suggest that where substantial FCB contamination of runoff occurs from manure-treated pasturelands, it might be disproportionately associated with specific field or management conditions, such as the presence of soils that exhibit low water infiltration and generate larger volumes of runoff or the absence of a vegetated buffer.

Achieving these ecosystem service goals depends, in part, on their ability to remove water from the soil via transpiration. In these systems, edges between crop fields and trees of the buffer systems can create advection processes, which could influence water use by trees. We conducted a field study in a riparian buffer system established in 1994 under a humid temperate climate, located in the Corn Belt region of the Midwestern U.S. (Iowa). The goals were to estimate stand level transpiration by the riparian buffer, quantify the controls on water use by the buffer system, and determine to what extent advective energy and tree position within the buffer system influence individual tree transpiration rates. We primarily focused on the water use response (determined with the Heat Ratio Method) of one of the dominant species (Acer saccharinum) and a subdominant (Juglans nigra). A few individuals of three additional species (Quercus bicolor, Betula nigra, Platanus occidentalis) were monitored over a shorter time period to assess the generality of responses. Meteorological stations were installed along a transect across the riparian buffer to determine the microclimate conditions. The differences found among individuals were attributed to differences in species sap velocities and sapwood depths, location relative to the forest edge and prevailing winds and canopy exposure and dominance. Sapflow rates for A. saccharinum trees growing at the SE edge (prevailing winds) were 39% greater than SE interior trees and 30% and 69% greater than NW interior and edge trees, respectively. No transpiration enhancement due to edge effect was detected in the subdominant J. nigra. The results were interpreted as indicative of advection effects from the surrounding crops. Further, significant differences were document in sapflow rates between the five study species, suggesting that selection of species is important for enhancing specific riparian buffer functions. However, more information is needed on water use patterns among diverse species growing under different climatic and biophysical conditions to assist policy and management decisions regarding effective buffer design.",0

Sown margin strips are key features of agri-environmental schemes in European agricultural landscapes and have been shown to benefit grasshoppers depending on the initial sown seed mixture. Understanding the mechanisms by which the sown mixture impacts grasshoppers in sown margin strips is the aim of our study. Here, we investigated plant–grasshopper interactions in sown margin strips and the respective effects of plant identity and diversity on grasshoppers. We surveyed plants and grasshoppers in 44 sown margin strips located in Western France which were initially established with three sowing mixtures dominated, respectively, by alfalfa, Festuca rubra and Lolium perenne and Festuca arundinacea. Grasshopper species contrasted in their response to plant diversity and to the abundance of sown and non-sown plant species. Some grasshopper species were positively correlated with the abundance of grass and especially of a single sown plant species, F. rubra. In contrast, other grasshopper species benefited from high plant diversity likely due to their high degree of polyphagy. At the community level, these contrasted responses were translated into a positive linear relationship between grass cover and grasshopper abundance and into a quadratic relationship between plant diversity and grasshopper diversity or abundance. Since plant identity and diversity are driven by the initial sown mixture, our study suggests that by optimizing the seed mixture, it is possible to manage grasshopper diversity or abundance in sown margin strips.",0

They are potentially important for wetland biodiversity but, despite their ubiquity, information on their biodiversity and management in the wider countryside is scarce. We surveyed 175 ditches for their physical and chemical characteristics, spatial connectivity, plant communities and aquatic invertebrates in an area of intensively managed farmland in Oxfordshire, UK and collected information on ditch management from farmer interviews. Water depth and shade had a small impact on the diversity of plant and invertebrate communities in ditches. Increased shade over the ditch channel resulted in reduced taxonomic richness of both channel vegetation and aquatic invertebrates and channel vegetation cover was lower at shaded sites. Invertebrate taxonomic richness was higher when water was deeper. Spatial connectivity had no detectable impact on the aquatic invertebrate or plant communities found in ditches. The number of families within the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT), which contain many pollution-sensitive species, declined with decreasing pH of ditch water. As time since dredging increased, the number of EPT families increased in permanent ditches but decreased in temporary ditches. Whether or not a ditch was in an agri-environment scheme had little impact on the reported management regime or biodiversity value of the ditch. Measures for increasing the amount of water in ditches, by increasing the water depth or promoting retention of water in ditches, could increase the biodiversity value of ditches in agricultural land. Some temporary ditches for specialised species should be retained. Reducing the amount of shade over narrow ditches by managing adjacent hedgerows is also likely to increase the species diversity of plant and invertebrate communities within the ditch. We recommend that to preserve or enhance the biodiversity value of ditches, and improve their ecosystem service delivery, management prescriptions for hedgerows adjacent to ditches should differ from those aimed at hedgerows only.",1

In intensive pastoral systems the landscape at ground level is clad in dense, filtering vegetation – yet phosphorus losses in overland flow do occur, and pollution of surface waters is a serious consequence. The use of pre-applied polyacrylamide (PAM) or chitosan to trap particulate phosphorus (PP) and P-sorbing potable water treatment alum residue (PWTR) to enhance vegetative filtering effects is examined here using field and laboratory overland flow simulation (flows from 0.43 to 0.34 litres s−1 (m width)−1) and analysis.



Fitted equations suggest that up to 40% of dissolved reactive P applied (0.75 mg P litre−1) in overland flow could be captured in a flow length of 2.1 m (1 kg PWTR m−2). Unfortunately, drying decreased PWTR effectiveness, though little of the P captured was readily desorbed. This effect did not appear to be the result of gibbsite formation. Compared with the other treatments, there was a strong treatment effect of pre-applied PAM on the change in PP losses (P < 0.001) over time, though evidence suggests the PAM effect declined during a 44 minute flow period.



We showed that the investigated two-pronged approach to the enhancement of the effectiveness of P trapping by pasture had limitations. Laboratory sheet-flow simulations suggest that a field-stable P sorber with sorption characteristics similar to those of the un-dried PWTR could be an effective retention enhancer for dissolved P. Pre-applied PAM can have an effect on particulate-P trapping but was rapidly dissolved and removed by flow.",0

The fine—(at 550 m) spatial patterns of the key environmental predictors and the pure spatial effects on species richness were measured using a computation of the principal coordinates of a matrix of geographical neighbours integrated into a variation partitioning. The total explained variation of species richness among hedgerows was highest for wetland herbs (62 %), with increasing rates for rare plants (33 %), forest herbs (43 %) and arable weeds (47 %). 43–11 % of that variation was spatially structured and mostly explained by some of the key environmental predictors, such as proportion of a given landuse, presence of woody species and dead trees. This indicates that complex relationships between herbaceous species distribution and spatial processes exist in woody field margins and much of that is related to key factors which are spatially structured, both at fine or broad-scales, with implications for management and landuse planning.",0

1. In high-intensity agricultural landscapes, small landscape elements such as hedgerows, ditch banks, and rows of pollard trees may represent the last refuge of many plant and animal species, some of them being rare or even threatened with extinction. However, due to their small size and low habitat quality, long-term population survival cannot be ascertained and often active management is needed to maintain viable populations of species forced to survive in these small landscape elements.



2. Population models are needed to assess the threats to species at risk and to evaluate alternative management actions. Here, we present a methodology to evaluate management interventions using spatio-temporal analyses of point patterns. We apply this method to several populations of primrose Primula vulgaris in Flanders, where it is rare and predominantly occurs along ditch banks.



3. The effects of ditch bank clearing on the establishment success of seedlings was investigated by comparing spatial patterns of seedling recruitment, survival and mortality between populations that were grazed and populations that were severely disturbed by mechanical clearing of ditch banks followed by annual mowing. A total of 884 seedlings were mapped and monitored during 4 consecutive years (1999–2002).



4. In all populations, plants showed significant clustering, but in cleared sites only seedlings were significantly clustered around adults. Spatial patterns of mortality varied according to the management intervention. In grazed sites, mortality was almost random, whereas in cleared sites we found clear evidence for strong negative density-dependent mortality. There was no evidence that the presence of adults affected survival of recruits in any of the sites studied.



5. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that the analysis of spatial point patterns contributes to our understanding of the population dynamics of plant species occurring in different environments. The approach can be broadly applied to other plant species to elucidate the processes that determine the number of individuals that establish and persist into later life stages and will help conservation managers to refine management strategies intended to conserve or restore plant populations. In the case of P. vulgaris, increasing the availability of microsites is most likely to result in increased growth rates, as it results in increased recruitment and establishment of recruits.",0

The restoration of degraded riparian zones to improve a range of functions is attracting increasing interest, but there are still questions about (i) how effectively restoration changes riparian or channel conditions; (ii) whether riparian management offsets the effects of wider catchment pressures; and (iii) whether these effects can be detected quantitatively. 2. A catchment-scale experiment was used to assess the effects of riparian restoration on riparian and channel conditions in the Welsh River Wye. In a hierarchically designed survey, variations in river habitat character were assessed among tributaries where riparian zones were recently managed for restoration (n = 9 streams), unmanaged controls (n = 12), intensively grazed pastures (n = 3) and coniferous plantation (n = 3). Management between 1997 and 2003, largely involving coppicing, was designed to exclude grazing through fencing in order to enable vegetation development while creating salmonid refuges. River habitat character was assessed using the UK 'River Habitat Survey' (RHS) method, with habitat variation quantified using Principal Components Analysis. 3. Stream habitats varied significantly among treatment categories. Streams draining plantation conifer had 'harder' channel features, while those draining intensively grazed pasture were characterized by finer substrata and more active channels than elsewhere. Riparian management reduced livestock trampling ( = poaching) and increased algal cover relative to controls. Coppicing and riparian fencing successfully excluded grazing on banks while increasing, in-stream vegetation cover, but did not affect substrata, flow-types and channel features. 4. These data show that RHS can detect habitat variation among streams in contrasting riparian land-use, revealing some apparently significant effects of recent restoration. We advocate longer-term investigations at reach to catchment scales to assess longer-term effects on channel and flow character, and to appraise fully the extent to which local riparian management can offset impairments at a catchment or larger scale, such as altered run-off regimes, sediment delivery and climate change.

Astroturf mats (n = 136) were placed within contrasting buffer features at nine sites [mid-field hedges (two sites), edge-of-field grass strips (six sites) and channel wetlands (one site)] within the River Parrett basin in England. Sediment was recorded on the mats at seven of the sites during the 18-month sampling period. At the other two sites either there was insufficient erosion or sediment by-passed the mats. At the seven sites where mats collected sediment, there was a considerable range in sediment deposition over the 18-month sampling period with site-average values (based on all mats at a site) ranging from 0.02 ± 0.06 to 1.15 ± 1.88 g cm )2 ; the average for all 136 mats was 0.41 ± 1.08 g cm )2 , or approximately 0.27 g cm )2 year )1 . Most of the sediment collected on the mats (n = 60) was sand-sized (>63 lm) material. The site-average total-P content of the <63 lm fraction of the deposited sediment ranged between 616 and 1938 mg kg )1 (average 890 mg kg )1 ). About half of all the mats that collected sediment were from the front of the buffers. Comparison of the sediment in the buffer features with topsoil from the contributing upslope fields suggests that the buffers trap coarser sediment with lower P concentrations, than the contributing topsoil. This suggests that the finer fraction, enriched in total-P, may be passing through the buffers towards river channels. Comparison between sites indicates that sediment deposition within buffers is greater at sites with steeper slopes, erodible soils and certain types of land use, such as maize for silage, reflecting the greater soil erosion and sediment transfers in these fields. The location and careful design of buffer features is a key factor in their effectiveness.",1

Since the 1990s, federal and state conservation agencies in Virginia have been involved in establishment of riparian buffers under the auspices of programs, such as the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). Riparian buffers established by the CREP program are considered to be beneficial towards the protection of water quality. However, the benefit is based upon assumption that planted trees and shrubs survive and grow. Little evaluation has been done within the state to document the success of the establishment efforts. We evaluated 63 riparian planting sites located in the Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and Ridge and Valley physiographic provinces of Virginia. Overall, the riparian forests in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont were fully stocked due to a combination of planted and natural regeneration. Riparian forests in the Ridge and Valley region were inadequately stocked, and the region has problems with invasive, exotic species. Major recommendations for improving the success of future riparian restoration and establishment efforts are to (1) include the potential for natural regeneration when planning CREP plantings, (2) stop mechanized operations in the riparian buffers that reduce planted and natural regeneration (e.g., mowing and disking), (3) reduce herbivory (particularly cattle) within the riparian buffer, and (4) control invasive exotic species as necessary.",0

While many crops benefit from insect pollination, soft fruit crops, including strawberries are highly dependent on this ecosystem service to produce viable fruit. However, as a result of intensive farming practices and declining pollinator populations, farmers are increasingly turning to commercially reared bees to ensure that crops are adequately pollinated throughout the season. Wildflower strips are a commonly used measure aimed at the conservation of wild pollinators. It has been suggested that commercial crops may also benefit from the presence of noncrop flowers; however, the efficacy and economic benefits of sowing flower strips for crops remain relatively unstudied. In a study system that utilizes both wild and commercial pollinators, we test whether wildflower strips increase the number of visits to adjacent commercial strawberry crops by pollinating insects. We quantified this by experimentally sowing wildflower strips approximately 20 meters away from the crop and recording the number of pollinator visits to crops with, and without, flower strips. Between June and August 2013, we walked 292 crop transects at six farms in Scotland, recording a total of 2826 pollinators. On average, the frequency of pollinator visits was 25% higher for crops with adjacent flower strips compared to those without, with a combination of wild and commercial bumblebees (Bombus spp.) accounting for 67% of all pollinators observed. This effect was independent of other confounding effects, such as the number of flowers on the crop, date, and temperature. Synthesis and applications. This study provides evidence that soft fruit farmers can increase the number of pollinators that visit their crops by sowing inexpensive flower seed mixes nearby. By investing in this management option, farmers have the potential to increase and sustain pollinator populations over time.",0

Cut strips contained more species than the grass crop but most were generalists or woody species. A few semi-natural species were present in non-experimental field margins bordering the grass crop fields, but few colonized the strips.

The external benefits to society can be worth as much as the private benefits to producers. However, the external benefits have not been quantified or monetized in a well-documented way. In this study, external benefits were estimated for tree seedlings distributed by the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Shelterbelt Centre in the Canadian Prairie Provinces for the period 1981–2001. Estimation of these benefits required information on the biophysical changes caused by shelterbelts and their valuation. Using literature, we estimated that the value of these external benefits amounted to over $140 million (2001 CDN$; CDN$1 = US$0.63). The majority of this value was derived from carbon sequestration ($73 million) and reduced soil erosion ($15 million) services with the remainder being contributed by biodiversity and water and air quality services. Other external benefits, such as health values, transportation safety, aesthetics and property values were identified but could not be estimated due to a lack of data. The estimated value for external benefits conferred by shelterbelts in this study indicates that they are large and suggests that both private and external benefits need to be considered in formulating policies or programs so that benefits to the society can be maximized.",0

However, plant diversity in field boundaries has decreased substantially in recent decades. This pattern is generally linked with the intensification of agricultural land use at field and landscape level. Therefore, we aimed to test the effect of farming management (field and boundary management), boundary structure (width and habitat assemblage considering the Mediterranean grassland element), and landscape heterogeneity on plant species richness of field boundaries. Plants were recorded along 30 field boundaries next to organic fields and 30 next to conventional fields located in 15 agrarian localities of NE Iberian Peninsula along a gradient of landscape complexity. A total of 517 plant species were identified in the 60 field boundaries. We recorded 162 species (31%) catalogued as rare, very rare or extremely rare in the flora of the Catalan Countries. Our results showed the importance of landscape heterogeneity, field management and habitat assemblage, since they were found to be the most influential variables for plant species richness; whereas boundary width and boundary management were seen to contribute less to explaining plant diversity. Accordingly, agri-environmental schemes should be designed to promote organic farming and maintain the structure of the landscape mosaic in order to benefit plant diversity in field boundaries in the Mediterranean region.",0

Non-floral factors affecting distribution included the degree of shelter, insolation, width of hedgebank or grass verge, and uncultivated habitat. Farm tracks adjacent to the field boundaries exerted a negative effect on abundance. 3. Floral variables affecting distribution included the abundance of flowers of bramble (Rubus fruticosus), thistle-like Compositae, marjoram (Origanum vulgare) and mayweeds (Matricaria spp.) in conservation headlands.

In recent decades the botanical diversity of arable field boundaries has declined drastically. To determine the most important factors related to the species composition of arable field boundaries, the vegetation composition of 105 herbaceous boundaries, 1-m wide, in the central and eastern Netherlands was surveyed. Biomass samples of the boundary were taken at 0-33, 34-66 and 67-100 cm from the adjacent arable field. 2. Farmers were interviewed with respect to boundary management and land use on the adjacent arable field. The two data sets containing the botanical data and the environmental variables were linked and analysed by multivariate analysis and analysis of variance. 3. The nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to the crop were closely correlated to another environmental variable, crop rotation. Crop rotations dominated by maize cultivation received significantly higher nutrient inputs than the other rotations. 4. Nitrogen, phosphorus and crop rotation were strongly correlated with the composition of the boundary vegetation. Species richness of the boundary vegetation was negatively related to nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to the crop, while total boundary biomass was negatively related to nitrogen inputs only. Furthermore, there was a significant relationship between the partitioning of the boundary vegetation between different functional groups and both nitrogen inputs and crop rotation on the adjacent arable field. No significant relationships were found between the vegetation composition and either herbicide use in the boundary or boundary management. This may have been due to the descriptive approach of the study: little variation in boundary management as well as herbicide use in the boundary was observed in the study area. 5. The boundary vegetation was characterized by a peak in biomass production in the zone near the arable field. In this zone the perennial arable weed Elymus repens, as well as annual dicot species, were significantly more abundant, while perennial dicots and monocots were significantly less abundant compared with the zones further from the arable field. 6. Efforts to protect field boundary vegetation need to focus on a reduction or cessation of fertilizer applications in the outer metre(s) of crops that require high nutrient inputs. The determination of the exact nature of the relationship between the vegetation composition of arable field boundaries and the intuitively important management and herbicide use in the boundary requires an experimental approach.",0

Multivariate (co-inertia) analysis was used to analyse relationships of habitat and landscape descriptive variables with rodent records. Two main ecological gradients were recognized according to statistical analysis. Relationships of species occurrence with environmental factors were interpreted according to their main life traits. The first ecological gradient clearly differentiated communities from hedges to those of grass-dominated linear banks. This first gradient was associated with the prevalence of forest versus grassland rodent species. This partitioning seems to reflect rather ecological requirements of species than competitive interactions. Small rodents diversity and abundance were inversely evolving along this gradient. The second factor influencing species assemblages was associated to landscape heterogeneity surrounding the permanent habitats. According to this second gradient, species seemed to be selected in relation to their ability to disperse and to use cultivated fields. Maximum diversity was generally observed in heterogeneous permanent habitats with mixed vegetation structure but hedges are important to produce biomass for predators.",1

Date of silking was the most important predictor of bird damage to corn; earlier maturing fields received greater damage. A field's peak population of northern corn rootworm beetles (Diabrotica longicornis) was the second most important variable and was also negatively correlated with bird damage. Other variables of lesser importance were the extent to which a field was bordered by woods and hedgerows and the field's weediness (both positively correlated with damage). Husk extension past the tip of a corn ear was always negatively correlated with blackbird damage within a given field that received higher amounts of bird damage. Because this variable was unimportant in explaining variation in damage among fields, however, we feel that recommending the use of corn hybrids whose bird-resistance is based primarily on husk extension is unwarranted. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 49(4):1109-1115 On a continent-wide basis, blackbird damage to corn is not a serious problem. Less than 1% of the total crop is lost to blackbirds (primarily red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus) in both the United States (Stone et al. 1972) and Canada (Tyler and Kannenberg 1980), whereas insects, weeds, fungi, and diseases combine to reduce potential yield by an average of at least 20% (Jugenheimer 1976:261, Pimental 1976, McEwen 1978, Dolbeer 1980). Blackbird damage to corn, however, is not evenly distributed. Whereas most farmers receive little or no damage, a small proportion of growers suffer severe economic losses (Dolbeer 1981). Although on a regional scale, most of this major bird damage occurs in cornfields located near autumn blackbird roosts (Cardinell and Hayne 1945, Dyer 1967, Martin 1977, Dolbeer 1980), damage levels vary widely even among fields located",0

In this study, bird surveys were carried out during the winter and breeding season on nine farms in the east and south-east of Ireland and field boundaries at each site were assessed using the Field Boundary Evaluation and Grading System (FBEGS). Poisson regression demonstrated that FBEGS scores were a good predictor of both winter and breeding bird species richness and diversity within the field boundaries studied. We interpret these preliminary results with caution since our sample size was relatively small (compared to the wide variety of field boundary types found in Ireland) and no single combination of field boundary attributes is likely to be optimum for all bird species. However, our results suggest that FBEGS may be a useful surrogate indicator of overall field boundary bird diversity and we discuss the consequent implications for agri-environmental policy, and for the possible adaptation and use of FBEGS as a tool to monitor the impact of changing farm management practice.",0

However, hedgerows and other structures can also impede dispersal by flying insects. The current work uses the pollen of Phacelia tanacetifolia in hover fly guts as a marker to assess hover fly movement in farm landscapes. In the United Kingdom and New Zealand, Phacelia pollen was found in the guts of Ephisyrphus balteatus and Metasyrphus corollae (United Kingdom) and Melanostoma fasciatum (New Zealand) at distances up to 200 m from the source, when there were no barriers between the flowers and the traps used to catch the flies. The rate of decline over distance in the proportion of flies containing pollen was similar for the two countries. The extent to which four replicated field boundary types impeded hover fly movement was tested using post-and-wire fences, lines of poplars (Populus spp.) with gaps, dense poplars and controls (no potential barriers). Phacelia was planted on one side of each boundary, and along the centre of the control plots. The relative presence of the pollen in flies on both sides of the barriers showed that both types of poplar boundary restricted the movement of the flies, but the fence had no effect. In a separate experiment, gravid females of M. fasciatum were captured at a greater height on a shade-cloth fence than were non-gravid females and males. The implications of this work include the functioning and persistence of metapopulations and the influence of field boundaries on population recovery of beneficial invertebrates following pesticide-induced mortality. If field boundaries contribute to a temporal asynchrony between pest and natural enemy populations, this needs to be considered along with the well-established roles of boundaries as refugia for, and sources of, beneficial arthropods.",0

Weedy-margin vegetation may harbor pests or pathogens and may also serve as source populations for ongoing immigration of weeds into the field. It is also possible, however, that margin vegetation provides habitat for organisms that consume weed seeds or suppress the likelihood of pest or pathogen outbreak. We examined the nature of margin habitat using spatial-scaling of weed-species richness as an ecological assay. In 2003, we recorded the occurrence of weedy species along the perimeters of 63 fields in Wisconsin. The fields were distributed within six counties that differed in topography, geological history, local climate, and soil type and which spanned the range of variability in the agricultural landscape. We identified seven habitats that differed in geology and land use. The relationship between species richness and margin class was estimated using an analog of the power law. Additionally...",0

Grassland accounts for 81 million ha of land within the EU; however, the ecology of field margins associated with permanent grassland has not been well studied.
This study investigated the effects of experimental field margin measures on hymenopteran parasitoid communities over a 5-year period. Hymenopteran parasitoids were chosen because they occupy high trophic levels, feed on a diverse range of plant and invertebrate hosts, and are considered good indicators of arthropod diversity. Establishment methods included: fencing, natural regeneration, and reseeding with a wildflower mixture, at three margin widths.
Field margin establishment method had a significant effect on abundance of parasitoids. Establishment method did not have a significant effect on parasitoid genera diversity, but did affect parasitoid community composition. Margin width had no significant impact on parasitoid communities.
Grazing had a significant negative effect on parasitoid genus richness and community structure. This suggests that structural diversity of vegetation plays an important role in parasitoid community structure.
Plant species richness did not significantly affect parasitoid abundance or genera richness. Noxious species within plots resulted in a significantly greater abundance and diversity of parasitoids and of idiobionts in particular.
Where plant species richness is limited, simple measures such as fencing of narrow field margins may be as effective at increasing parasitoid taxon richness and abundance (indicators of arthropod richness and abundance) as expensive measures such as reseeding and wider margin widths.",0

The buffer site received NO3-N loading from an agricultural field that was fertilized with inorganic fertilizer. Field results showed the buffer reduced groundwater NO3-N concentration moving to the stream over a five-year period. REMM was calibrated hydrologically using daily field-measured water table depths (WTDs), and with monthly NO3-N concentrations in groundwater wells. Results showed simulated WTDs and NO3-N concentrations in good agreement with measured values. The mean absolute error and Willmott's index of agreement for WTDs varied from 13-45 cm and 0.72-0.92, respectively, while the root mean square error and Willmott's index of agreement for NO3-N concentrations ranged from 1.04-5.92 mg/l and 0.1-0.86, respectively, over the five-year period. REMM predicted plant nitrogen (N) uptake and denitrification were within ranges reported in other riparian buffer field studies. The calibrated and validated REMM was used to simulate 33 years of buffer performance at the site. Results showed that on average the buffer reduced NO3-N concentrations from 12 mg/l at the field edge to 0.7 mg/l at the stream edge over the simulation period, while the total N and NO3-N load reductions from the field edge to the stream were 77 and 82%, respectively.",0

The aim of this paper is to describe and illustrate the use of a newly developed field-based evaluation tool for riparian buffer zones in agricultural catchments. The Buffer Zone Inventory and Evaluation Form (BZIEF) incorporates criteria-based scoring systems developed from literature review, subsequent peer-review, and then a pilot field study. Use of the BZIEF is demonstrated by comparing buffer zones in three catchments established for water quality and habitat improvement under the Water Fringe Option agrienvironment scheme in England in order to assess whether the buffers were likely to provide environmental enhancement. Results among the three catchments were generally similar; buffer zones scored highly for their abundant vegetation cover, lack of erosion, stream habitat quality, and sufficient width. Furthermore, previous grassland or arable land use did not substantially affect buffer zone ratings. However, the BZIEF indicated that inappropriate soil characteristics in one catchment were likely to constrain buffer zone effectiveness for improving water quality. In another catchment, poor riparian vegetation diversity and structure may yield ineffective habitat enhancement, according to the BZIEF. It was concluded that the BZIEF might be a useful tool for buffer zone comparison and monitoring, even though more work is needed to test and validate the method. For example, the BZIEF could be used to target appropriate locations for buffer zones and is flexible, so could be adapted for different policies, objectives and regions.",0

This study compared performance of different filter strip designs on several contaminants and evaluated the contributing processes. Different vegetation types and widths were investigated using simulated runoff event on large plots (3 m × 7.5 or 15 m) having fine-textured soil and a 6 to 7% slope. Filter strips 7.5 and 15 m wide downslope greatly reduced concentrations of sediment in runoff (76-93%) and contaminants strongly associated with sediment (total P, 55-79%; permethrin, 27-83% 1(3-phenoxyphenyl) methyl (±)-cis,trans-3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate]). They had less effect on concentrations of primarily dissolved contaminants [atrazine, -5-43% (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine); alachlor, 10-61% [2-chloro-2'6'-diethyl-N-(methoxymethyl) acetanilide]; nitrate, 24-48%; dissolved P, 19-43%; bromide, 13-31%]. Dilution of runoff by rainfall accounted for most of the reduction of concentration of dissolved contaminants. Infiltration (36-82% of runoff volume) substantially reduced the mass of contaminants exiting the filter strips. Doubling filter strip width from 7.5 to 15 m doubled infiltration and dilution, but did not improve sediment settling. Young trees and shrubs planted in the lower one-half of otherwise grass strips had no impact on filter performance. Compared with cultivated sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] grass clearly reduced concentrations of sediment and associated contaminants in runoff, but not volume of runoff and concentration of dissolved contaminants. Settling, infiltration, and dilution processes can explain performance differences among pollutant types and filter strip designs.",0

We experimentally tested if fire ant mound density and foraging activity increased after burning and disking in native grass buffers. In 2008, fall disking increased mound density and foraging activity during the first growing season post-disturbance, but burning did not.

water bodies. It is commonly assumed that runoff proceeds perpendicularly across a VF as sheet flow. However, there is little
research information on natural pathways of water movement and performance of field-scale VF. The objectives of this study
were: (1) to quantify the performance of a VF where the flow path is not controlled by artificial borders and flow path lengths
are field-scale, and (2) to develop methods to detect and quantify overland flow convergence and divergence in a VF. Our
hypothesis is that flow converges and diverges in field-scale VF and that flow pathways that define flow convergence and
divergence areas can be predicted using high-resolution topography (i.e., maps). Overland flow and sediment mass flow were
monitored in two 13 × 15 m subareas of a 13 × 225 m grass buffer located in Polk County in east-central Nebraska.
Monitoring included a high-resolution survey to 3 cm resolution, dye tracer studies to identify flow pathways, and
measurement of maximum flow depths at 51 points in each subarea. Despite relatively planar topography (a result of grading
for surface irrigation), there were converging and diverging areas of overland flow in the buffer subareas. Convergence ratios
ranged from -1.55 to 0.34. Predicted flow pathways using the high-resolution topography (i.e., map) closely followed actual
flow paths. Overland flow was not uniformly distributed, and flow depths were not uniform across the subareas. Despite
converging and diverging flow, the field-scale VF trapped approximately 80% of the incoming sediment.",0

Habitats associated with broadleaved woodland and water were most preferred, while arable land, moorland and improved grassland were strongly avoided. Linear vegetation features were selected in all landscapes, demonstrating the importance of habitat continuity to bats. The availability of preferred habitats was low and patchy in all landscapes, indicating that bats have specialized habitat requirements. Differences in habitat selection between landscape types and possible factors influencing habitat selection are discussed. Habitat selection analysed on a local scale demonstrated the same consistent preference for woodland, riparian and corridor habitats across 19 discrete land classes. Management policies for bats in Britain should endeavour to preserve and enhance the availability of woodland, water margins and linear corridor habitats. Lack of continuity of the landscape, loss and fragmentation of habitat patches plus deterioration of the quality of such patches may pose a threat to bat populations.",0

Although the water purification effect of riparian ecosystems has been well studied, there is little knowledge of their internal cycling, especially in the area of gaseous emissions. We measured fluxes of nitrous oxide (N 2 O), dinitrogen (N 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in riparian grey alder stands in southern Estonia and black alder stands in Brandenburg, Germany. Dinitrogen emission was the most important component in N retention in the studied riparian grey alder forests. In 2001-2003, the median values of N 2 emission in the grey alder sites significantly exceeded the N 2 emission rates in the black alder sites, varying from 700 to 1200 and from 360 to 400 kg N 2 -N ha -1 year -1 respectively. In contrast, the median values of N 2 O flux were higher in the black alder sites than in the grey alder sites, i.e., 0.9-2.6 and 0.2-0.7 kg N 2 O-N ha -1 year', respectively. The black alder sites acted as a sink for CH 4 , whereas the grey alder sites emitted a small amount of CH 4 . The CO 2 -C flux was higher in the black alder stands. The estimated N 2 -N emission in the grey alder stands for 1994-1995 was 51.2, whereas N 2 O-N emission was 0.5 kg N ha-' year'. The significant increase in N 2 emission from 1994-1995 to 2001-2003 can be related to changes in microbial activity during the succession of the pioneer grey alder stand into a more stable mixed forest community. Due to CO 2 fluxes and N 2 O fluxes from sites with altered water regime, the estimated GWP of the studied riparian alder stands was relatively high. Further investigations should concentrate on the factors that regulate rates of N 2 O and N 2 emission from riparian buffer zones.",0

GIS-models are increasingly used to assess habitat preferences and distribution of target species, but their accuracy is constrained by availability of digital data layers. We developed a two-steps approach aiming at showing pros and cons of landscape (GIS)- and site-level habitat models, identifying key habitat factors for conservation of a threatened bird species, the red-backed shrike Lanius collurio. A spatially explicit GIS-model was generated using landscape variables, and a second model at site level was developed using fine-scale variables measured on the ground. The GIS-based model was then extrapolated to the entire region to obtain a map of distribution of suitable habitats. Positive associations between shrike occurrence and both hedgerow length and partial shrub cover were detected at both scales. Shrikes were also positively associated with grassland cover at landscape level and with partial cover of untilled herbaceous vegetation at the finer scale, and negatively affected by lucerne cover. The GIS-model led to an affordable map of predicted habitat suitability which should help conservationists to focus on different local priorities, but was unable to identify effects of untilled and lucerne cover. Site-level model gave fine details for habitat management, but its application elsewhere requires ground-measurements of factors. Combining the multiscale models could indicate more urgent actions at large scales (e.g. maintaining suitable habitats, or improving connectivity among isolated patches) and draw a detailed figure of the most suitable habitat for the species. Shrike occurrence was associated with a higher number of shrub and tree species: the indicator value of the species should ensure general benefits for biodiversity from dedicated management.",0

This study evaluates the comparative effectiveness of three conservation practices in reducing runoff, sediment, N, and P losses from 1.5- by 16-m plots on an Aeric Epiaqualf. Three practices compared are a traditional fescue (Festuca arundinacea) filter strip (Fescue-FS), a switchgrass barrier in combination with the Fescue-FS (B-Fescue-FS) and a switchgrass barrier in combination with a native grass and forbs species filter strip (B-Native-FS). This study also predicts transport of sediment, N, and P in Fescue-FS and B-Fescue-FS. Fescue-FS and B-Fescue-FS of equal widths (0.7 m) significantly reduced runoff and sediment transport as compared with a continuous cultivated fallow (CCF) treatment, but B-Fescue-FS was more effective for reducing runoff (p < 0.05) and sediment (p < 0.01) transport. B-Fescue-FS was also more effective than Fescue-FS for reducing losses of organic N, NO 3 -N, NH 4 -N, particulate P, and PO 4 -P (p < 0.01). Fescue-FS and B-Native-FS were equally effective for reducing runoff, sediment, and nutrient loss. Effectiveness of FS increased with distance with 18% of runoff, 92% of sediment, and 71% of nutrient leaving the source area being reduced in the first 4 m of the FS. An equation to predict sediment associated with runoff ponding above barriers explained approximately 70% of the variability between measured and predicted values of sediment, organic N, and particulate P transport. Combination of switchgrass barriers with FS is an effective alternative to Fescue-FS alone for reducing sediment and nutrients in runoff.",0

Non-crop corridors may have the potential to enhance the connectivity for arthropod predators in cropland landscapes, especially for species that require multiple habitats, such as cavity-nesting wasps which use wooded habitat for nesting and grassland habitat for foraging. However, the effects of corridors in nonexperimental landscapes have been rarely examined. We studied the species richness and abundance of cavity-nesting wasps and their parasitoids in standardized trap nests located in three habitat types (forest edge, hedge, grass strip) and in three grass-strip types (connected to a forest edge, slightly isolated, highly isolated from a forest edge). Species richness and the abundance of wasps (Hymenoptera: Sphecidae, Eumenidae, Pompilidae) were highest at forest edges, which provide natural nesting sites, and lowest in grass strips, with few natural nesting sites. Wasp abundance in grass strips connected to forest edges was 270% higher than in slightly isolated grass strips and 600% higher than in highly isolated grass strips. The abundance of caterpillar-hunting eumenid wasps was 600% higher in connected grass strips than in slightly and highly isolated grass strips. Species richness of wasps was enhanced by 180% in connected grass strips compared to highly isolated grass strips. Parasitism rates were not directly influenced by habitat or grass-strip type, but increased with increasing parasitoid diversity that was higher at forest edges than in grass strips. We conclude that grass-strip corridors enhance the colonization of nesting sites, presumably by facilitating wasp movements. In agricultural landscapes, where nesting sites are limited and food availability changes frequently, rapid colonization of nests may enhance population viability. Higher wasp abundance in connected nesting sites may be directly linked to higher biocontrol of pest caterpillars within the foraging range around nests. Although grass strips can reduce the negative effects of habitat fragmentation, non-crop habitats such as forest habitats and hedges providing nesting sites are required within the home range of wasps to allow reproduction in agricultural landscapes.",1

The objective of this study was to assess the influence of buffer width and vegetation type on the key processes and overall reductions of total suspended solids (TSS), phosphorus (P), and nitrogen (N) from simulated runoff passed through established (7-year old) RBSs. Nine 1-m RBS plots, with three replicates of three vegetation types (all natural selection grasses, two-segment buffer with native grasses and plum shrub, and two-segment buffer with natural selection grasses and plum shrub) and widths ranging from 8.3 to 16.1 m, received simulated runoff having 4,433 mg/l TSS from on-site soil, 1.6 mg/l total P, and 20 mg/l total N. Flow-weighted samples were collected by using Runoff Sampling System (ROSS) units. The buffers were very efficient in removal of sediments, N, and P, with removal efficiencies strongly linked to infiltration. Mass and concentration reductions averaged 99.7% and 97.9% for TSS, 91.8% and 42.9% for total P, and 92.1% and 44.4% for total N. Infiltration alone could account for >75% of TSS removal, >90% of total P removal, and >90% of total N removal. Vegetation type induced significant differences in removal of TSS, total P, and total N. These results demonstrate that adequately designed and implemented grass-shrub buffers with widths of only 8 m provide for water quality improvement, particularly if adequate infiltration is achieved.",0

However, being located near a wooded edge may increase grassland bird vulnerability to edge effects through reduced nest survival. We examined nesting bird communities in field margins adjacent to wooded field edges with no buffer (i.e., control), narrow (approx. 10-m) buffers, and wide (approx. 30-m) buffers in an intensive agricultural system in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley, United States. Dickcissel (Spiza americana) and red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) accounted for 97% of nests. Nest density was >7 times greater in wide buffers than in narrow. We modeled nest survival in Program MARK as a function of time (yr and season), nest-site, and local vegetation characteristics. Nest survival was influenced by among- and within-season temporal effects and local vegetation structure, but not by buffer width. Nest success varied substantially between years and within seasons for dickcissel (12.9% and 19.1% early in the seasons of 2003 and 2004, respectively), but not for red-winged blackbird (15.1%). Overall nest-success estimates were similar to noncrop, herbaceous strips elsewhere in the United States, though whether or not these estimates represent population sinks remains uncertain. Based on this research, we advocate integrating upland habitat buffers within intensive agricultural landscapes and emphasize the use of wide buffers when grassland-nesting birds are a conservation priority. 2011 The Wildlife Society.",0

Communities of spiders, ground beetles, true bugs and aphids were sampled in 2years along transects from the centre of organically managed cereal fields into adjacent grassy margins. Based on species richness, abundances, ecological and body size traits of species and taxonomic distinctness between species, communities were compared between organically managed cereal fields and their grassy margins. The species richness, abundance and variation in taxonomic distinctness of true bugs were significantly higher in grassy margins. For spiders and ground beetles, these metrics were either higher in cereal fields or did not differ significantly. At the species level, spiders living under stones or in soil crevices, as well as phytophagous ground beetles and true bugs that overwinter as eggs benefited from grassy margins. True bug communities in cereal fields were dominated by a few abundant species, whereas communities in margins were rather dominated by a few large species. Our comprehensive analyses highlight the importance of accounting for species identities and biology in biodiversity studies. The traits that characterised arthropod species that benefited from margins are not characteristic for pest species. Grassy margins along organic fields therefore represent an important agri-environmental scheme for the conservation of several arthropod taxa and margins should not be removed to increase the crop production area in organically managed cereal fields.

Associations between vegetation characteristics and parasitoid abundance, sampled five times at monthly intervals using canopy sticky traps, were investigated.
The presence of vineyard or pasture adjacent to the shelterbelt had no impact on hymenopteran family abundance within the shelterbelt. The availability of floral resources influenced a single family; the abundance of the Trichogrammatidae was doubled by the presence of canopy floral resources. By contrast, an increased abundance of some large Hymenoptera families was associated with a decreasing leaf litter depth and the proportion of introduced ground cover, an increased grass height and the amount of ground with vegetated cover.

Giant cane and forest riparian buffer zones were monitored to determine each cover type's ability to reduce ground water nitrate concentrations. Ground water was sampled at varying distances from the field edge to determine an effective width for maximum nitrate attenuation. Ground water samples were analyzed for nitrate concentrations as well as chloride concentrations, which were used as a conservative ion to assess dilution or concentration effects within the riparian zone. Significant nitrate reductions occurred in both the cane and the forest riparian buffer zones within the first 3.3 m, a relatively narrow width. In this first 3.3 m, the cane and forest buffer reduced ground water nitrate levels by 90 percent and 61 percent, respectively. Approximately 40 percent of the observed 99 percent nitrate reduction over the 10 m cane buffer could be attributed to dilution by upwelling ground water. Neither ground water dilution nor concentration was observed in the forest buffer. The ground water nitrate attenuation capabilities of the cane and forest riparian zones were not statistically different. During the spring, both plant assimilation and denitrification were probably important nitrate loss mechanisms, while in the summer nitrate was more likely lost via denitrification since the water table dropped below the rooting zone.",0

The NC Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (NC CREP) has established buffers to treat groundwater nitrate-nitrogen (NO3−-N) from agricultural sources in multiple river basins. A maturing 46 m wide riparian buffer enrolled in NC CREP was studied to determine its effectiveness in reducing groundwater NO3−-N concentrations from a cattle pasture fertilized with poultry litter. Three monitoring blocks that included groundwater quality wells, water table wells, and soil redox probes, were established in the buffer. NO3−-N concentrations decreased significantly across the buffer in all of the monitoring blocks with mean reductions of 76-92%. Many biological processes, including denitrification and plant uptake, may have been responsible for the observed NO3−-N reductions but could not be differentiated in this study. However, mean reductions in Cl− concentrations ranged from 48-65% through the blocks, which indicated that dilution was an important factor in observed NO3−-N reductions. These findings should be carefully considered for future buffer enrollments when assigning nitrogen removal credits.",0

Both study areas showed a capacity to deplete essentially 100% of NO3−–N from subsurface waters. Attenuation was concentrated in the leading 20 – 30 m of the riparian zones, suggesting the sites had a significant, unused potential for NO3−–N depletion. At Carroll Creek, a comparative study of NO3−–N concentrations from differently vegetated riparian zones was performed. Both woody and grassy riparian areas demonstrated a decrease in NO3−–N concentrations below the limits of detection (<0.02 mg/L).

Two sites, grass (L.), and poplar ()-vegetated riparian strips, were investigated in southern England (River Leach). Groundwater flow was via subsurface pathways within the sites, NO concentration gradients and loading rates were calculated over the winter period. Nitrate retention was found to be linearly dependent on load rate. Nitrate retention occurred at the edge of the riparian zone. This was most obvious in the poplar site where all hillslope-derived NO was absorbed within the first 5 m of flow within the riparian strip. When loading rates into the sites increased, NO absorption migrated upslope from the riparian site. The poplar-vegetated riparian zone was found to be more resilient (99% retention of NO) than the grass-vegetated riparian zone (84% retention of NO) in the winter months. It is postulated that although vegetation has no active role in retaining NO in the winter, above-ground vegetative biomass does contribute C to the soil microbacterial biomass that is engaged in NO reduction in the winter months, this accounted for the greater efficiency of the poplar vegetated site.",0

Research was conducted under nonirrigated conditions at the Shel- terbelt Research Area, Univ. of Nebraska Agricultural Research and Development Center (ARDC) near Mead. 'Strike' (white-seeded) and 'Rushmore' (dark-seeded) were planted in locations sheltered from wind stress by tree windbreaks (shelterbelts) and in locations exposed to normal winds using a randomized complete-block design with a split-split plot arrangement of treatments. Air temperature, soil temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction were monitored. Detailed microclimate conditions at bean canopy level in sheltered and exposed plots are provided in the text. Wind speed in sheltered areas averaged 36% of open fi eld wind speed in 1994 and 43% of open wind speed in 1995. Soil tempera- tures were higher in sheltered areas than in exposed areas. Microclimate changes due to shelter had no effect on the percent seedling emergence or number of days to emergence. Plants in shelter had signifi cantly higher total dry weight and leaf area index and greater total internode length than exposed plants. Both total and marketable yields were increased signifi cantly by production under sheltered conditions each year. Planting date and cultivar also had a signifi cant impact on average pod yields. No interactions between shelter and planting date, or shelter and cultivar, were found in either year. The results suggest that wind protection provided by shelterbelts (tree windbreaks) can increase pod yields of snap bean both early and late in the season. This may result in greater profi t for the grower due to a tendency for higher prices at these times.",0

A total of 390 male and 373 female beetles was examined. Each female was dissected and the number of ripe eggs counted. The nutritional state was expressed by a condition factor, which was calculated for each individual based on the observed weight and elytra length of male and female P. cupreus. Carabids in the 1-year-old wildflower areas contained significantly less ripe eggs than those from the 4-year-old areas. The condition factor of female and male beetles was significantly lower in 1- than 2- to 4-year-old areas. We examined the influence of habitat parameters (vegetation cover, soil water content, coarse and fine sand, pore volume, habitat size and age, surrounding landscape structure) on the reproductive success and nutritional state of P. cupreus in the 16 wildflower areas. The number of eggs was best explained by habitat age, accounting for 53.4% of the variability. The variation in the condition factor of female and male beetles was best explained by habitat age, which accounted for 73% and 71% of the variation, respectively. Moreover, the beetles' reproductive potential and nutritional condition were significantly associated with vegetation cover, and occasionally also with soil water content. The potential of wildflower areas as a reservoir for the generalist predator P. cupreus was shown to increase with successional age.",0

This study examined variation in the habitat selection and breeding success of yellowhammers, allowing an evaluation of whether Britain's yellowhammer decline might have been caused by recent changes in agriculture.



2. Yellowhammer territories were associated with hedgerows, vegetated ditches and wide uncultivated grassy margins around fields. Pasture and silage leys were avoided. Nests were built among herbaceous vegetation in ditches or in the shrubby vegetation of hedgerows.



3. Breeding started slightly earlier on organic farms than on intensively managed farms, but no measure of breeding success differed between farm types. Predation was the cause of most (64%) nest failures. A maximum of three breeding attempts (two successful) was observed per pair, with a mean clutch size of 3·3, a Mayfield nest success rate of 0·46, and 2·6 nestlings fledged per successful brood. These data, together with published estimates of adult yellowhammer survival and of post-fledging survival among other passerines, suggest that breeding productivity is too low to maintain a stable population.



4. The removal of hedgerows or abandonment of hedge management, filling or clearing of ditches, intensification of grassland management and cropping or grazing right up to the field edge, are all likely to have adversely affected yellowhammers on lowland farmland in southern England. Policy reforms that redirect subsidy support to environmentally beneficial management of field margin habitats and retention of winter-feeding sites such as stubbles should assist in restoring populations of breeding yellowhammers on lowland farmland.

The winter distributions of a range of polyphagous predators were investigated in relation to field boundary structure. The distribution of Demetrias atricapillus was significantly positively correlated with the density of cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata) tussocks, and Forficula auricularia and Tachyporus chrysomelinus were significantly positively correlated with percentage cover of deciduous leaf litter, However, although densities of predators varied significantly between field boundaries, no further relationships were identified to explain the observed predator distribution patterns. It is suggested that detailed intensive investigations rather than the extensive approaches of the present study, are required to address questions relating to successful over wintering and selection of over wintering site.",1

We tested whether AES options aimed at increasing general biodiversity also benefit a highly endangered moth, Polia
 bombycina, without species-specific tailoring. We assessed effects on its abundance of two AES options, wide field margins and hedgerow trees, using light traps at the landscape-scale and for mark-release-recapture at the farm-scale. We hypothesized that abundance would be highest at wide field margins and at hedgerow trees, and that if hedgerow trees conferred a positive effect, individuals would be more likely to follow hedgerows than crossing exposed fields while on the move. The results showed that significantly more individuals were captured at sites with a hedgerow tree. Numbers were also higher at wide margins, but this was not statistically significant, and no individuals were caught at field centres. Our study suggests that general options within appropriately designed and implemented AES aimed at increasing overall biodiversity in intensive agricultural landscapes have the potential to not only benefit common, widespread habitat generalists, but some rare and more endangered species as well. P. bombycina serves as an example of how general AES options, existing and novel ones alike, might cater for the needs of rare and localised species. As the precise ecological requirements of most invertebrate species remain unknown, we urge scientists and governments to address the challenge to research and design truly general AES, which options should be able to deliver not only for widespread species but also for the less-widespread counterpart of farmland biodiversity.",0

1. Wildlife reintroductions can help to restore populations and save species from extinction. However, success rates of reintroductions are low due to inherent problems, such as behavioural deficiencies resulting in high post-release predation rates among captive-bred animals. In particular, the released animals may use habitats maladaptively, leading to an ecological trap, i.e. preference for low-quality habitats leading to reduced survival and/or breeding success. Ecological traps in reintroductions can be identified only through intensive studies of habitat preferences and survival of known individuals, but such studies are lacking.

2. We investigated habitat preferences and their relationship with survival by radio-tracking reintroduced, captive-bred grey partridges Perdix perdix, a widely reintroduced commercial game species and native farmland bird of conservation concern in the UK. The low success rate of grey partridge releases could be due to maladaptive habitat use and a possible ecological trap.

3. Grey partridges released as pairs in spring showed preferences for crop and field margin habitat. The use of crops had a positive, and use of field margins a negative, association with survival, suggesting field margins could serve as ecological traps for released grey partridges. Predation rates were high, and field margins probably hosted concentrated predator activity.

4. Grey partridges released as family groups (coveys) in autumn exhibited a preference for game covers, i.e. areas of tall vegetation specifically planted to provide cover for game birds, and mortality rates were lower than in spring. Habitat use did not affect survival in autumn.

5. Synthesis and applications. We have shown that newly released grey partridge pairs behave maladaptively by preferring a habitat which has a negative association with survival. In grey partridge reintroductions, we recommend releasing grey partridge family groups in autumn rather than releasing pairs of birds in spring, and providing game covers that could induce the groups to settle onto the release areas. In reintroductions in general, the habitat preferences of the released animals should be documented together with their fates, to enable detection of possible ecological traps that could threaten the success of these conservation efforts.",0

The Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra is considered a suitable indicator for the conservation value of farmland habitats, and has recently suffered strong declines throughout much of its European range. As a basis for targeted conservation measures, we investigated the habitat preferences of this species in north-eastern Germany by comparing the composition of male territories with randomly chosen control sites. A territory was defined as the area within a radius of 150 meters around the assumed centre of the territory, as the majority of nests is found within this radius. To assess food availability for nestlings, arthropod abundance within the most abundant land use types i.e. crop fields, fallows, grassland as well as within unploughed strips was investigated. In total we found 102 male Corn Bunting territories, which were mainly composed of crop fields (50%), grassland (28%), and fallows (12%). Territories compared with control sites were characterized by a lower proportion of crop fields, a higher proportion of fallows, more diverse land use types, more abundant field boundaries, unploughed strips, and tracks, and a higher availability of song posts. However, neither the number of larger (≥ 1 cm), smaller ( 10%) and song posts (> 70 m 'linear song posts' or > 1 solitary post per ha) for the habitat selection of male Corn Buntings. We conclude that measures to halt population declines of Corn Buntings seem to be relatively easy to implement, provided that farmers are granted a fair compensation.",0

However, little is known about their impact on mammals, including the brown hare, a priority species for conservation in the UK. We studied radio-collared hares for 13 months in a mixed agricultural area using ‘homing in’ to provide high spatial-resolution fixes. Hares selected agri-environment field margins during both active and inactive periods and used the areas in the middle of large fields less frequently than those closer to the field boundaries. Blocks of woods and lines of trees were selected as resting sites while sheep-grazed fields were generally avoided throughout the year. We suggest that agri-environment schemes targeted at creating and increasing non-farmed habitat features associated with field boundaries and reducing sward depletion through less intensive or mixed grazing regimes could prove beneficial for populations of this priority species in farmland.",0

The destruction of traditionally managed orchards, an important breeding habitat in Central Europe, is a relevant cause. An additional factor for the decline of this species could be the intensified management of the ground vegetation in orchards through reducing food availability and lowering prey detectability and accessibility. In this study we examined the importance of surfaces with sparse vegetation for the location of redstart territories and for foraging. To validate the results of these field studies we made habitat-choice experiments in aviaries with captive birds. Territories occupied by redstarts in orchards of northwestern Switzerland contained a significantly higher proportion of surfaces with sparse vegetation than unoccupied control sites. Redstarts made almost five times more hunting flights into experimentally established ruderal vegetation strips than into adjacent unmown meadows. No difference was observed when the meadow was freshly mown. Vegetation height and the proportion of open ground surface correctly predicted the vegetation type for hunting in 77% of the cases. Experiments in aviaries offering two types of sparse vegetation and a dense meadow supported the results of the field experiments. Even a four-fold increase of the food abundance in the meadow did not lead to a noticeable change in preference for the sparse vegetation types. For the conservation of the common redstart, not only traditionally managed orchards with tall trees with cavities should be preserved but also areas with sparse vegetation should be favored.",0

Habitat overlap and breadth were similar in the two species; both species avoided woods and chose hedgerows in spring and summer but in autumn‐winter selection of permanent cover differed: grey partridges selecting hedgerows and red‐legged partridges calanques and landslides, the driest habitats in the study area. Significant differences were also found for nesting site selection: grey partridges preferred the edges of habitats and hedgerows, while red‐legged partridges selected the centre of habitats, vineyards and uncultivated land. In general, grey partridges seemed to be more linked to crops and open land than did red‐legged partridges and this latter species needs a similar habitat in cover structure and micro‐climate to those of its zones of origin.

Here we focus on changes resulting from removal of land from arable production under the set-aside scheme. Wood mice were radio-tracked to compare: (a) their use of set-aside, crop and hedgerow before and after harvest; (b) set-aside configured as margins and as a 3 ha block; (c) cut and uncut 20-m wide set-aside margins. Males had larger home ranges, and were more mobile than females. Ranges were larger, and animals more mobile, before harvest than afterwards. There were no differences in range sizes of breeding and non-breeding animals after harvest, suggesting that changes in habitat use were not a function of cessation of breeding. Before harvest, wood mice used habitats within their ranges at random, and their ranges contained a high proportion of cropped area. After harvest they preferred hedgerow and avoided margin set-aside within their ranges, but did not similarly avoid the set-aside block. The proportion of cropped area within their ranges decreased after harvest, and the proportion of margin increased. Our evidence suggests wood mice avoided using the area adjacent to the hedgerow, perhaps to avoid predators. Uncut set-aside patches were favoured and cut patches avoided, possibly in response to differences in food availability and levels of protection from predators. These results confirm that wood mice are useful indicators of change in arable landscapes.",0

The barrier was comprised of a planting of three rows of hybrid poplar, Populus deltoides Bartr.×Populus nigra L., one row of Italian alder, Alnus cordata L. (nectar reward), and one row of white pine, Pinus strobus L. The hedgerow completely surrounded the perimeter of the apple orchard and was treated with garlic and a low rate of pyrethroid insecticide in 4 of the 5 years. The Enhanced IPM program significantly reduced G. molesta populations as measured by moth captures in pheromone traps. Captures of G. molesta were significantly higher in apple orchards treated with OP and carbamate insecticides, ‘Conventional IPM’, and either not surrounded by the hedgerow or with the barrier present but not treated with the repellent compounds. To explain these differences in G. molesta control, and the potential non-lethal effect of hedgerow barriers on G. molesta orchard colonization, we studied the adult vertical movement in a traditional unsprayed standard apple orchard at three different heights: 0.95, 1.95 and 3.20 m, respectively. In the overwintering generation at a height of 0.95 and 1.95 m, the mean number of moths captured per sampling period was 14.64 and 14.84, respectively, and only 2.95 at 3.20 m. However, the number of individuals captured in the second and third generations was not significantly different at the three different heights. Fruit damage evaluated before ‘June drop’ closely corresponded to the distribution of moths captured during the overwintering generation. Fruit damage at a height of 1.95 and 3.20 m was 5.8 and 3.5%, respectively. These results indicated that G. molesta is a weak flyer and that hedgerow barriers exerted some influence in the colonization of the orchard by limiting the free movement of adults from the overwintering generation. Thus, hedgerow barriers seem to limit early migration and establishment of G. molesta in the orchard. This in turn may reduce the size of the following generations and makes subsequent control easier under the Enhanced IPM program.",0

Knowledge about the hydrological role of hedgerows is useful in many fields of study, such as hydrological modelling and rural landscape management. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a hedgerow on rainfall distribution, soil-water potential gradient, lateral water transfer and water balance. A hillslope with a hedgerow perpendicular to the slope was monitored. To evaluate hedgerow rainfall interception, rainfall was measured (hourly, daily, and by rainfall event) both next to and up to 16 m upslope and 12 m downslope perpendicularly away from the hedgerow. The strongest correlation between rainfall next to the hedgerow and rainfall at more distant points was obtained using data measured per rainfall event. The average percentage of rainfall intercepted equalled 28% for the leafed period and 12% for the leafless period. The impact of the hedgerow on spatial rainfall distribution was related to distance from the hedgerow and rainfall amount. Annual distribution of soil-water potential showed that the hedgerow influenced it up to 9 m upslope and 6 m downslope, the area in which most of the hedgerow's roots were observed. The soil was driest at the end of summer, which delayed soil rewetting during autumn in areas surrounding the hedgerow. Annual groundwater dynamics exhibited three distinct periods due to temporal rainfall distribution and, especially at the end of summer, root-water uptake. In addition, the total potential gradient showed that unsaturated flow was directed towards the hedgerow in summer and autumn. These results indicate that at the local scale hedgerows influences (1) spatial rainfall distribution, (2) soil rewetting, and (3) groundwater recharge, often at distances well beyond the hedgerow's drip line. Consequently, the processes involved in soil-water dynamics around hedgerows should be integrated into relevant hydrological models, especially for catchments with a dense hedgerow network.",0

Hedgerow quality can be greatly affected either by over- or under-management. Neglect of hedgerows is an increasingly important issue as traditional management techniques such as hedgelaying become economically unviable. In the UK, funding for hedge management is available under agri-environment schemes but relatively little is known about how this impacts on wider biodiversity. We used a randomised block experiment to investigate how habitat structural change, arising from a range of techniques to rejuvenate hedgerows (including more economic/mechanised alternatives to traditional hedgelaying), affected invertebrate abundance and diversity. We combined digital image analysis with estimates of foliage biomass and quality to show which aspects of hedge structure were most affected by the rejuvenation treatments. All investigated aspects of habitat structure varied considerably with management type, though the abundance of herbivores and predators was affected primarily by foliage density. Detritivore abundance was most strongly correlated with variation in hedge gap size. The results suggest that habitat structure is an important organising force in invertebrate community interactions and that management technique may affect trophic groups differently. Specifically we find that alternative methods of hedgerow rejuvenation could support abundances of invertebrates comparable or even higher than traditional hedgelaying, with positive implications for the restoration of a larger area of hedgerow habitat on a limited budget.",0

Crucial to achieving this is identifying management options that are practical and beneficial to biodiversity, and understanding the influence of the surrounding landscape. We used data on abundance and species richness of farmland macro-moths, many of which are declining, and trait-based analyses on their feeding guild, mobility and conservation status, to explore local- and landscape-scale effects of two farmland features (extended-width field margins and hedgerow trees) and surrounding farmland intensification. Macro-moths were light trapped at 48 fixed sites on 16 farms, over 4 years, within a 1200-km2 area of lowland UK farmland. Sites belonged to one of four experimental groups that differed in their combinations of hedgerow tree presence and field margin width. Hedgerow trees and extended-width field margins locally increased species richness, but not abundance, of macro-moths, irrespective of each other's presence. Overall, species richness and abundance were not affected by agricultural intensification, as measured by the amount of arable land in the surrounding landscape. Sedentary moths showed double the species richness, but were half as abundant as mobile moths. Both groups responded positively to extended-width margin and hedgerow tree presence. The effect of hedgerow trees was particularly strong for shrub- and/or tree-feeding species. Analyses based on the conservation status of moths demonstrated that agricultural intensification lowered the species richness of nationally severely declining UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species and the abundance of both nationally moderately declining and priority species. These effects were most pronounced at the 0·8-km radius scale. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the presence of extended-width field margins and hedgerow trees, possibly promoted by agri-environment schemes targeting their implementation at relatively small spatial scales (0·8 km), may help mitigate negative effects of agricultural intensification on macro-moths. A wide range of other taxa feed on macro-moths and may therefore indirectly benefit from these features. Nevertheless, taxa differ widely in their mobility and measures mitigating biodiversity loss may need to be targeted at multiple spatial scales to maximize their effectiveness for multiple taxa.",2

They are part of rural landscapes and should not be studied without considering the farming systems and the rural society as a whole. Their species composition depends on the history of the countryside, as well as current farming practices. Land use and boundary management play a major role in determining the floristic composition of hedgerows, and are strongly related to the grain size of the field's mosaic. Hedgerow networks, due to their rectilinear shape, and with their high degree of connection, enhance or interrupt many fluxes in the landscape. Hedgerows act as a corridor of movement and dispersal for many forest species, such as carabids, small mammals, and plants. On the other hand, hedgerows interrupt or slow down air fluxes and the propagules they carry. In the heterogeneous mosaic of fields and wooded patches, hedgerows often increase the functional connectivity of rural landscapes. The future of hedgerows...",0

Given these premises, a study was done on the eastern Po Plain, in a transition area between the Temperate (Eurosiberian) and Mediterranean climatic zones, adopting the same sample shape and dimensions as a North-American study [Corbit et al. (1999) J Ecol 87:220–232]. The following research questions were posed: (1) how common are forest species in hedgerows? (2) do origin, isolation, distance from source, width and adjacent land-use factors correlate with the frequency of forest species? (3) are hedgerows corridors for forest species? To address these, three functional types of hedgerows, identified by comparing old aerial-photos, were sampled: remnant attached (n = 12) and remnant isolated (n = 6) with respect to the nearest woodland and regenerated attached (n = 4). If wooded patches were a source for hedgerows, then regenerated hedgerows should be more similar to an adjacent woodland than an isolated remnant. A 900 m2 circular plot in woodlands and an adjacent 90-m transect along hedgerows were sampled for the presence and cover of all plant species, then 39 woodland taxa were selected. Significant differences between the three hedgerow types emerged in forest species richness, but not in cover. The forest species composition in both remnant and regenerated attached hedgerows showed a strong affinity with the adjacent stand, implying a dispersal process from woodland (source) to regenerated hedgerows (sink). A distance effect on forest species distribution clearly linked to a corridor function was found only in regenerated hedgerows, while in the remnant attached ones, even with a composition similar to that of the nearest woodland source, other additional factors cannot be ignored to explain the fine scale distribution of forest species. The cover of the most common ant-dispersed species showed a similar distance effect while vertebrate-dispersed ones did not show any significant trend with distance from woodlands. Habitat suitability for forest species was affected by width, especially in hedges wider than 12 m, but not by adjacent land use.",0

A source area of 0.41 ha (mainly Canisteo silty clay loam soil), having an average slope of 3%, was fall chisel-plowed, spring disked, and planted to corn. Three herbicides (atrazine, metolachlor, and cyanazine) were applied to the source area in each spring. Six vegetative buffer strips, 1.52 m wide ¥ 20.12 m long, were isolated with metal borders downslope of the source area in a well established bromegrass (Bromus inermis) waterway. These strips provided for three replications of two drainage to buffer area ratio treatments of 15:1 and 30:1. Herbicide retention was dependent on the antecedent moisture conditions of the strips. These retentions ranged from 11 to 100% for atrazine, 16 to 100% for metolachlor, and 8 to 100% for cyanazine. Herbicide retention by the buffer strips for the two treatments were not significantly different for the observed storm events. Herbicide concentrations in solution in outflow from the strips were less than the inflow concentrations for all the three herbicides. Infiltration was the key process for herbicide retention by the buffer strips, although there was some adsorption to in-place soil and/or vegetation. Metolachlor concentrations in sediment increased in outflow for the two treatments; however, the opposite was true for atrazine and cyanazine. Herbicide retention by sediment deposition in the strip represented about 5% of the total herbicide retention by the buffer strips. The buffer strips were found to have high percent sediment retention, ranging from 40 to 100%; thus, the strips would be more effective for retaining strongly adsorbed herbicides.",0

The effect of a
restored riparian forest buffer system (RFBS) on transport of two herbicides, atrazine and alachlor, was studied during
1993–1994. Herbicides were applied above a restored 3–zone riparian buffer system in April of 1993 and 1994. Bromide was
applied as a tracer with the April 1993 herbicide application. The buffer system was managed based on USDA
recommendations and averaged 38 m in width. The system included a grass buffer strip immediately adjacent to the
application area (zone 3), an area of planted pines downslope from the grass buffer (zone 2), and a narrow area of planted
hardwoods containing the stream channel system (zone 1). Most of the herbicide transport in surface runoff occurred before
June 30 with about 250 mm of cumulative rainfall after herbicide application. During this period of higher herbicide
transport, atrazine and alachlor concentrations averaging 12.7 g L –1 and 1.3 g L –1 , respectively, at the field edge were
reduced to 0.66 g L –1 and 0.06 g L –1 , respectively, as runoff neared the stream. The effect of dilution versus other
concentration reduction factors (infiltration, adsorption) was estimated for surface runoff using the bromide concentration
data. Concentration reduction was greatest per meter of flow length in the grass buffer adjacent to the field. There was only
minor transport of herbicides through the buffer system in shallow groundwater. Average herbicide concentrations were at
or below detection limits in groundwater near the stream for the entire study period. The restored riparian forest buffer had
similar effects on herbicide transport as a mature buffer.",0

The return period model suggested that most of the herbicide loss by runoff (about 98%) is caused by a few, or even just one, extreme rainfall event with a return period of about 25–27 years, whereas ordinary events (4–5 each year) account for the rest.

Many natural enemies hibernate in non-crop habitats, from which they may colonise arable fields in the spring. Spring colonisation ensures annual repopulation of the crop with natural enemies, allowing them to keep pace with the development of pest populations. The availability of non-crop habitats can, therefore, be crucial to successful conservation biological control. We quantified the density of overwintering natural enemies near organic Brussels sprout crops in five different non-crop habitats (short grassy field margin, herbaceous field margin, herbaceous field margin under a tree line, ditch and forest). Soil and litter samples of non-crop habitats were taken at two sites. One site was located in an open agricultural landscape, the other in a landscape dominated by mixed forest. Insects belonging to Staphylinidae, Araneae, Carabidae, Coccinellidae and Dermaptera were the most abundant. Mean densities of predatory arthropods were higher in the open agricultural landscape (290 predators m−2) than in the forested landscape (137 predators m−2). Herbaceous habitat types supported the highest densities of overwintering predators (up to 400 predators m−2), whereas densities in the forest were lowest (10 predators m−2). These results indicate that herbaceous non-crop habitats are important refugia for predators and may play a vital role in conservation biological control.",0

Compared to herbaceous vegetation, high transpiration rates are measured for isolated trees, shelterbelts or hedgerows. This article deals with the influence of a tree hedge on the soil and groundwater Cl− concentrations and the possibility of using Cl− as an indicator of transpiration and water movements near the tree rows. Cl− concentrations were measured over 1 year at different depths in the unsaturated zone and in the groundwater along a transect intersecting a bottomland oak hedge. We observed a strong spatial heterogeneity of Cl− concentrations, with very high values up to 2 g l−1 in the unsaturated zone and 1·2 g l−1 in the upper part of the groundwater. This contrasts with the low and homogeneous concentrations (60–70 mg l−1) in the deeper part of the groundwater. Cl− accumulation in the unsaturated zone at the end of the vegetation season allows us to identify the active root zone extension of trees. In winter, upslope of the tree row, downwards leaching partly renews the soil solution in the root zone, while the slow water movement under the trees or farther downslope results in Cl− accumulation and leads to a salinization of the soil and groundwater. This salinization is of the same order as experimental conditions produce negative effects on oak seedlings. The measurement of Cl− concentrations in the unsaturated zone under tree rows at the end of the vegetation season would indicate whether certain topographic, pedological or climatic conditions are likely to favour a strong salinization of the soil, as observed in the present study.

The effect of sampling methods on the number of hoverfly species and individuals was analyzed. Two sampling methods were used to catch hoverflies: netting and pan traps. The whole sampling period was divided into three subperiods, which are early (22nd April–2nd June), middle (11th June–1st August) and late (6th August–11th September). Altogether 1,214 individuals of 22 species were sampled. Fourteen species with 78% of individuals belonged to the aphidophagous group, feeding on aphids as larvae. Altogether 861 individuals of 22 hoverfly species were sampled by netting and 353 individuals of 10 species by pan traps. The total number of hoverfly species was significant lower in the late period than in the early. The total abundance was higher in the middle period compared to the early. The species richness and abundance of aphidophagous species followed a similar pattern as the total species values. The species richness and abundance of hoverflies were significant higher in 10 m and 20 m distance in the wheat field than along the hedgerow. The results suggest that the pan traps were less efficient in the hedgerow than the netting, but in the wheat field they sampled more hoverflies because of visually alluring effect on hoverflies in the absence of flowers.",0

Habitat destruction and increasing land use intensity result in habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, and subsequently in the loss of species diversity. The fact that these factors are often highly confounded makes disentangling their effects extremely difficult, if not impossible, and their relative impact on species loss is mostly speculative. 2. In a two-year study, we analysed the relative importance of changed landscape composition (increased areas of cropped habitats), reduced habitat connectivity and reduced habitat quality on nest colonization of cavity-nesting bees, wasps and their parasitoids. We selected 23 pairs of conventional and organic wheat fields in the centre of landscape circles (500 m radius) differing in edge densities (landscape configuration) and % non-crop habitats (landscape composition). Standardized trap nests were established in the field centres and in neighbouring permanent fallow strips (making a total of 92 nesting sites). 3. Factors at all three scales affected nest colonization. While bees were enhanced by high proportions of non-crop habitat in the landscape, wasps profited from high edge densities, supporting our hypothesis that wasps are enhanced by connecting corridors. Colonization of herbivore-predating wasps was lower in field centres than in fallow strips for conventional sites, but not for organic sites, indicating a fallow-like connectivity value of organic fields. The relative importance of habitat type and farming system varied among functional groups suggesting that their perception of crop-non-crop boundaries or the availability of their food resources differed. 4. Local and landscape effects on parasitoids were mainly mediated by their hosts. Parasitism rates were marginally affected by local factors. A specialist parasitoid was more sensitive to high land use intensity than its host, whereas generalist parasitoids were less sensitive. 5. We conclude that the conversion of cropland into non-crop habitat may not be a sufficiently successful strategy to enhance wasps or other species that suffer more from isolation than from habitat loss. Interestingly, habitat connectivity appeared to be enhanced by both higher edge densities and by organic field management. Thus, we conclude that high proportions of conventionally managed and large crop fields threaten pollination and biological control services at a landscape scale.",0

Information is needed on how the effectiveness of grass hedges changes over time after planting, and in response to hedge clipping management. Erosion from natural rainfall was measured during 13 yr after establishing single-row (eventually growing to be 1 m wide) miscanthus (Miscanthus sinensis Andersson) hedges at the lower end of erosion plots (21 m long, 5% slope) in a replicated study involving conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) grown on silt loam soils (Typic Fragiudalfs) in Holly Springs, MS. Sediment yield values from plots with and without grass hedges were analyzed with reference to the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to determine the conservation support practice (""P"" factor) for sediment yield, which is the fractional reduction in sediment yield due to the presence of the grass hedge. The ""P"" factor of grass hedges was found to be about 0.5 in the establishment year and to decrease progressively with time for CT cotton. The ""P"" factor for grass hedges averaged 0.23 for CT wide-row cotton and 0.12 for ultra narrow row (UNR) cotton studied with older hedges. ""P"" factors for NT were higher, averaging 0.5 for wide-row cotton and 0.65 for UNR cotton, perhaps reflecting a finer eroded sediment size distribution. Comparison of several methods of estimating hedge effectiveness showed that while observed monthly rainfall effects on soil erosion were not fully explained by the E130 term used in RUSLE, fitting more complex statistical models to the data did not appreciably alter estimates of fractional sediment yield reduction due to grass hedges. The results of this study demonstrated that during extreme events, hedge effectiveness was enhanced (""P"" was lowered) by management that allowed accumulation of hedge clippings upslope of the hedges. However, for freshly tilled conditions, ""P"" values for 7-yr old hedges varied from 0.2 for monthly rainfall = 100 mm to 0.35 for monthly rainfall = 400 mm even when all residues were removed.",0

The variability of carbon storage within this biological system, including soil organic matter, is explored, and the number of samples required to achieve a desired level of statistical certainty are predicted. As has been investigated previously for other biological systems (Garten and Wullschleger, 1999), the study shows that a prohibitively large number of samples must be taken in order to achieve high degrees of certainty about mean carbon storage values. The study also shows, however, that mean values with somewhat greater uncertainties can easily be achieved with much smaller sample sizes. Thus carbon sequestration verification might be accomplished cost-effectively if the degree of certainty required is not unrealistically high for highly variable natural systems.",0

Two different sampling methods were evaluated: drop cloth sampling and suction sampling. The overall catch was dominated by juvenile spiders, web-building spiders, and spiders of the families Theridiidae, Linyphiidae, Tetragnathidae and Araneidae (in decreasing order). Field margins harboured more species than maize fields, whereas the total spider abundance was higher in the maize crop. Web-building spiders such as Theridiidae and Linyphiidae were prominent in maize by individual numbers. Suction sampling with a small suction device proved to be a more efficient and consistent sampling method for foliage-dwelling spiders than drop cloth sampling.

Our aims were firstly to examine factors controlling spatial variation in bank erosion, secondly to estimate sediment and phosphorus (P) loss via bank erosion. The overall mean bank erosion rate was 11 mm year−1. Bank erosion rate over the 2-year period was significantly related to a number of site-specific characteristics, including bank angle, bank vegetation cover, overhanging bank and estimated stream power. An empirical model for bank erosion based on these descriptive variables yielded a 55% explanation of the observed spatial variation in bank erosion rate. Bank erosion was higher at the lower 50-cm bank section (20 mm year−1) than at the upper bank (6 mm year−1). Cattle fencing in grazed areas and buffer zones with riparian woodland lowered bank erosion rates. We found that total P content of bank material was high (0·64 g P kg−1) and at the same level as found in agricultural topsoil along the streams. The overall annual catchment loss of bank-derived clay–silt sediment and total P to streams amounted to 58–72 kg sediment ha−1 and 0·23–0·28 kg P ha−1, respectively. In comparison, the mean annual suspended sediment (SS) and total P losses from 14 similar sized Danish agricultural catchments were 122 kg SS ha−1 and 0·58 kg P ha−1 over the 2-year study period. Thus, bank erosion seems to be a major contributor of suspended sediment and P in this type of small channelized lowland stream. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0

Riparian buffers are often used to reduce agricultural NPS yet the effect of buffers in the watershed is difficult to quantify. Using corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) and model averaging, we compared flow-path riparian buffer models with land use/land cover (LULC) models in 24 watersheds from the SE Coastal Plain to determine the ability of riparian buffers to reduce or mitigate stream total nitrogen concentrations (TNC). Additional models considered the relative importance of headwaters and artificial agricultural drainage in the Coastal Plain. A buffer model which included cropland and non-buffered cropland best explained stream TNC (R2 = 0.75) and was five times more likely to be the correct model than the LULC model. The model average predicted that current buffers removed 52 % of nitrogen from the edge-of-field and 45 % of potential nitrogen from the average SE Coastal Plain watershed. On average, 26 % of stream nitrogen leaked through buffered cropland. Our study suggests that stream TNC could potentially be reduced by 34 % if buffers were adequately restored on all cropland. Such estimates provide realistic expectations of nitrogen removal via buffers to watershed managers as they attempt to meet water quality goals. In addition, model comparisons of AICc values indicated that non-headwater buffers may contribute little to stream TNC. Model comparisons also indicated that artificial drainage should be considered when accessing buffers and stream nitrogen.",0

Results showed that hedgerows could notably reduce soil erosion and runoff soon after their establishment, the Lonicera japonica Thunb. hedgerow showed the best effect on it. All of the four tested hedgerows could reduce slope gradient in a certain extent, while Lonicera japonica Thunb. hedgerow exhibited the most obvious effect on it.

Displacement experiments of bromide and two herbicides, isoproturon and metribuzin, were performed in unsaturated undisturbed soil cores sampled on a unique site under (i) conventional wheat/maize rotation, (ii) 10-year-old grassed strip and (iii) 80-year-old oak/chestnut forest. Steady state conditions at constant rainfall intensity were used to compare the effect of the different land uses on soil herbicide transport and dissipation parameters. For each herbicide, mobility was similar between grassed strip and cultivated soils while it was reduced in the forest soils. The descriptive and moment analyses of the experimental breakthrough curves of bromide and herbicides demonstrated a similar degree of physical non-equilibrium transport for the cropped and grassland soil columns, with transport ranging from a less intense physical non-equilibrium status to the complete physical equilibrium state for the forest soil columns. Chemical non-equilibrium transport was shown for the three situations. Degradation occurred in some columns as demonstrated by the elution of a metabolite of isoproturon. Previous data on sorption and degradation of isoproturon on the same soils were used to explain the differences observed in the analysis of the elution curves between grassed strip, forest and cultivated soil. Averaging Kd values from individual soil layers of each profile gave a satisfying understanding of isoproturon retardation factors. Sorption on soil organic matter was the main factor in herbicide mobility. However, other phenomena such as degradation and formation of non-extractable residues were involved in the differences observed in leached masses of isoproturon between the three situations.",1

The experimental system consisted of four replicate plots in a three-way completely randomized design (no buffer zone, grass buffer zone, and grass+tree buffer strips). The field plots were 5 m wide and 30 m long and grown in corn. The grass and grass+tree buffer strips were 5 m and had the same grass vegetation except for eight young hybrid poplars. Over the 2-yr study, surface runoff and subsurface infiltration water (under the buffer strip) were collected after the initial three rainfall events after herbicide application. Dissolved atrazine, metolachlor, and DEA were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The presence of buffer strips decreased the exported masses of atrazine and metolachlor in surface runoff. A three-way ANOVA with treatment (type of buffer strip), water (surface runoff or subsurface infiltration), and time between herbicide application and rainfall event as factors showed a significant reduction (40-60% in 2004 and 75-95% in 2005) in the total (surface runoff+infiltrated water) exported masses of atrazine and metolachlor in the presence of buffer strips. Rainfall events after herbicide application were different between the 2 yr and greatly affected the flow distribution (e.g., subsurface infiltration) and the leached herbicide concentrations. No significant difference in the capacity to reduce herbicide exports was observed between grass and grass+tree buffer strip treatments; the poorly developed young poplar biomass at the time of the study may partly explain this observation.",1

Generally, grass filter strips reduced exported herbicide masses by more than 90% and influenced atrazine and metolachlor dissipation kinetics in the field. The 3-m grass filter strip (area ratio source/strip of 22:1) usually provided a reduction in exported herbicide masses similar to the 6- or 9-m grass filter strips. Therefore, under the present experimental soil and climate conditions, a grass filter strip of 3 m would be a good compromise between environmental protection of surface waters against atrazine and metolachlor contamination and conservation of agricultural land use.

1
The grey partridge is a species of conservation concern, in common with many farmland birds. Its widespread decline in western Europe has been attributed to agricultural intensification. Attempts to restore populations have concentrated upon habitat management. In France, a mosaic of strips planted with maize- or kale-based mixtures is widely used to benefit the grey partridge on intensively cultivated farmlands. The rationale for planting these summer-to-winter cover strips is to increase the overwinter survival rate and hence breeding density. Although this policy is costly to apply, there is little information on its effectiveness.

2
We tested effectiveness of this management scheme as a practical way of improving or restoring partridge populations. We present data from a 6-year before–after control–impact (BACI) experiment replicated across four study sites. We monitored partridge populations to estimate breeding density, reproductive success and overwinter mortality.

3
During the course of the study, no partridge population increase occurred on managed areas compared with control areas. Wildlife cover strips did not improve reproductive success but were associated with higher overwinter ‘apparent mortality’ rates.

4
Some field data suggested that there was a predation risk at cover strip–field edges. Cover strips may concentrate a number of species within small isolated areas and may act, under some circumstances, as an ecological trap for prey species such as the grey partridge. Due to these complex and unforeseen interactions, this habitat management measure proved unsuitable for partridge restoration.

5
Synthesis and applications. This study has demonstrated the necessity of field experiments at a farm-scale to test the effectiveness of habitat management schemes. A priori assumptions based on smaller scale studies, even if they are supported by some field evidence, can be misleading because they fail to capture the emergent properties of larger scale systems. This study is a specific illustration of how the BACI approach is a powerful tool for addressing wildlife management problems at large spatial scales.",0

This diversity is threatened by applications of fertilizer nitrogen. Organic fertilizer, in the form of farm-yard manure and rain-diluted liquid slurry which only slowly release nitrogen for plant uptake, might prove less damaging. A 5-year experiment on two contrasting sheep grazed, species-rich grassland field margin sites adjoining a mature hedgerow in mid-Wales compared three levels of fertilizer N (0, 100 and 300 kg N ha−1 year−1) with farm yard manure (FYM) and rain-diluted slurry containing an average annual equivalent of 30–42 kg N ha−1 and 27–72 kg N ha−1 respectively. The aim was to assess the impact of treatments on the plant communities of the hedge bottom and field margin strip ecosystems, and to establish whether the species diversity contained within the strips could be encouraged without significantly undermining the quantity and quality of the herbage.

Groundwater samples were collected from 20 sampling locations between May 1993 and December 1994, and analyzed for NO 3 -N, PO 4 , and NH 4 -N. Statistical analyses such as Friedman's test, cluster analysis, cross correlation analysis and Duncan's test were performed for the nutrient data. The study showed that the riparian buffer zone was effective in reducing nitrate concentrations originating from upland agricultural fields. Instream nitrate concentrations were 48 percent less than those measured in the agricultural field. Reductions in concentrations in sampling locations at the wetland edge ranged from 16 to 70 percent. The mean nitrate concentrations in forested hill slope were 45 percent less than concentrations in a well located in an upland agricultural field. Meanwhile, the concentrations of phosphate and ammonia did not follow any specific spatial trend and were generally higher during the summer season for most sampling locations.",0

We hypothesize that sorption equilibrium was not achieved in 2004 because of the short delay (<24 h) between herbicide application and the first rain event. In 2005, observations suggest that possible changing sorption equilibrium conditions were reached (20 days after atrazine application), especially for eroded sediments submitted to changing environmental conditions in subsurface. If confirmed by other experiments, this will raise the question of the representativeness of laboratory-determined soil sorption coefficients to predict the fate of pesticides.",0

Soil erosion plots were 4 by 22 m with 3 % slope. Regression analysis was used to describe herbicide concentration in runoff, and to deter- mine if vegetative filter strips reduced herbicide concentra- tion. Analysis of covariance indicated no difference in concentration of metolachlor or metribuzin in runoff from the three tillage systems within any vegetative filter strip treatment. Metolachlor loss in 1991 was highest from the no-till monocrop without a vegetative filter strip, and it was 65 g ha-1 or approximately 2% of the amount applied. In 1992 and 1993, the no-till doublecrop had a total loss of 120 and 147 g ha-1, respectively, approximately 4% of the amount applied. Similar results were noted with metribuzin, but total loss was as high as 46 g ha-1 or 11% of the amount applied in 1993 from a no-till doublecrop system without a vegetative filter strip. When a vegetative filter strip was present, losses of metribuzin and metolachlor were reduced over 85% in 1993, and totaled 1.2 and 0.5%, respectively, of the amount applied. The vegetative filter strip reduced herbicide and suspended solids from runoff produced by a conventional-till production system to levels equal to or lower than a no-till doublecrop system.

Traps were located in the crop centre and within four field margins from each field and serviced for three weeks in June/July in 2004. Trap locations were classified according to local habitat, crop, flower numbers and distances to other features, including woodland and water. Multivariate and regression analyses indicated that hoverfly numbers and species richness were significantly enhanced by proximity to winter oilseed rape crops, which maintained a significant weed flora below the crop canopy, compared with cereals. Catches were reduced close to set-aside and linseed, but margin type and flower numbers did not often contribute to models. Proximity to woodland was important for Ferdinandea cuprea and Episyrphus balteatus. Traps on the west side of fields, had lower catches than traps located elsewhere. Hoverflies appeared to be responding to factors at the field-scale, reflecting crop management and weed control, as well as non-crop habitat in the landscape.",0

USDA Conservation Reserve Program MRB contracts last 10-15 years; evidence shows MRB soil quality may improve within 3-7 years, but there is little data on how MRB soils perform after contracts typically expire. Slaked soil aggregate stability was measured in a 20-21 year-old MRB in central Iowa at the surface (0-15 cm) and used to calculate the indices mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD), and percent water-stable macroaggregates (%WSA). The MRB contained zones of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L. ‘Cave-inRock’), hybrid poplar (Populus spp.), and cool-season grass; results were compared with an adjacent crop field, a formerly grazed pasture, and a natural riparian forest. Bulk density, total soil carbon, and POM were also measured. A Cornell sprinkle infiltrometer was used to measure infiltration in a 10-year old tree and cool-season grass MRB, and in the switchgrass, cool-season grass and silver maple zones of the MRB used in the soil aggregate study. MRBs were compared with trafficked and non-trafficked crop interrows in a nearby crop field. Perennial vegetation had greater MWD, GMD, %WSA, and total SOC compared to the crop field. Data collected in 1997 showed no significant differences in %WSA or MWD between switchgrass and crop field, but did between cool-season grasses and crop field. However, %WSA and MWD under switchgrass increased 45.8% and 120.5%,",0

Oystershell scale has a wide host range which includes trees frequently used as orchard shelter. The distribution of oystershell scale in apples adjacent to an infested shelter belt was investigated in Otago in 1995–96. Apple infestation was >90% next to the shelter and declined linearly to <1% 64 m away. The slope of this linear regression was similar on four cultivars of apple but infestation increased substantially from early- to late-harvested cultivars.

Riparian management has been embraced by water and land managers globally to offset the deleterious effects of intensive agricultural land use on aquatic ecosystems. However, the documented responses of stream communities to riparian management have been variable, particularly in highly degraded systems. 2. We used boosted regression trees and structural equation models to assess the effects of riparian condition and stream size on the invertebrate communities of 64 agricultural waterways on the Canterbury Plains, New Zealand. We hypothesized that small streams would be more degraded than larger waterways but would show a greater increase in the abundance of pollution-sensitive aquatic invertebrates in response to riparian management. We also predicted that land-use legacies of poor in-stream habitat would reduce the effectiveness of current riparian management. The two strongest determinants of community structure were primarily in-stream habitat, where sedimentation and low water velocity had negative impacts on stream communities, and stream size, with smaller waterways generally more impacted than large waterways. Not surprisingly, with >150 years of agriculture and patchy riparian management on the plains, current management has not greatly improved in-stream habitat and thus had little effect on the abundance of sensitive aquatic insect (EPT) taxa. 3. Managed streams did, however, have more pollution-sensitive communities in general. This was largely mediated by decreased stream temperature, narrower ⁄ deeper channels and greater organic matter resources in streams with riparian planting and restricted stock access. Thus, if water velocity and sedimentation issues can be mitigated, then riparian management should become more effective. 4. Synthesis and applications. Within the context of a degraded agricultural landscape, we identified factors limiting the effectiveness of riparian management for stream invertebrate communities. Riparian management should primarily target and protect small streams and those without degraded in-stream habitat. Intensive management, such as in-stream habitat or channel morphology modification, may be needed to address historical factors (e.g. low velocity and sedimentation), which otherwise may continue to limit community recovery.",0

The Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) has investigated whether fencing off the margins of such fields next to watercourses to control diffuse pollution has any positive impacts on biodiversity, based on assessments of vegetation composition and condition and structure of assemblages of invertebrates of importance as foodstuffs to farmland birds. Fencing watercourses increased the abundance of key groups of invertebrates. However, the invertebrate species diversity was not increased unless the margins were ≥ 5.4 m in width. Margins established in the study area to prevent access by livestock to watercourses or to enhance biodiversity are generally ≤ 2.6 m wide and are therefore unlikely to provide conditions for additional invertebrate species to use. The dense, tall swards within such margins are also unlikely to provide foraging opportunities for farmland birds. Management (such as low-intensity grazing by livestock in the margins) is essential to provide the conditions required for these groups, but this could conflict with the diffuse pollution mitigation aims. A compromise is proposed whereby limited autumn/winter grazing by livestock could be used to open the vegetation structure in the margins. Grazing by livestock at that time may be acceptable since it is not occurring in the period of main diffuse pollution concern (i.e., the fecal contamination of watercourses and bathing waters in the spring and summer). It is also essential that a landscape-scale approach is taken, driven by knowledge of the full needs of the species concerned, when deciding where best to target agri-environmental actions aimed at farmland bird conservation.",1

Uncropped field margins are important foraging habitats on farmland for many declining bird species and are a key component of Agri-Environment Schemes across Europe. Maximizing the value of foraging habitats requires detailed knowledge of the factors influencing habitat selection and food availability. 2. We firstly conducted an observational study of foraging habitat selection by breeding yellowhammers Emberiza citrinella L. on lowland mixed farmland, in relation to underlying invertebrate and vegetation characteristics. 3. There was a clear seasonal shift in the relative use of field margins and cereal crops. Margins were used less than crops in late summer, despite supporting higher invertebrate abundance relative to cereals. Seasonal increases in vegetation height were most marked in margins, suggesting the seasonal decline in margin use may reflect reduced food accessibility. 4. In the second phase of the study, field margins were cut experimentally to create short, open patches within taller margin swards. The use of cut patches by foraging yellowhammers increased significantly between early and late summer, and patches were used more frequently with increasing height of adjacent uncut margin. These findings strongly support the theory that tall vegetation reduces margin accessibility in late summer. 5. Synthesis and applications. Provision of invertebrate-rich field margins is a core component of Agri-Environment Schemes, but current prescriptions may result in them having limited value in late summer. More effective management, such as more frequent cutting, may be required to maximize the benefits for foraging birds by creating short, open vegetation patches. Measures to increase accessibility to invertebrates on farmland are likely to benefit a range of bird species across a variety of crop types.",0

In 1991, however, both number of species and activity densities of ground beetles in the weed-strips and the cereal parts in between were similar. In 1991, activity density in cereal parts between weed-strips was significantly higher than in a bordering control area. Most of the activity densities of all 23 abundant species were significantly higher in the strip-managed area than in the control area. Furthermore, the number of species in the strip-managed area was higher. In addition, most sampling dates (1990 and 1991) revealed a significant negative regression between activity density and distance from the first strip, i.e. width of the cereal parts between the strips.

1.  The structural complexity of agricultural landscapes influences the local biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Hence, developing effective biodiversity management requires a better understanding of the relative importance of local and landscape changes, especially for functionally important organisms such as hoverflies benefiting from flowering plants.

2.  We examined hoverfly (Diptera: Syrphidae) communities in broad and narrow sown flower strips, in naturally developed grassy strips and in wheat fields (as a control). We also investigated the effects of these four habitat types on syrphid occurrence in the adjacent wheat fields.

3.  The relative influence of local vs. landscape effects was tested by selecting study sites along a gradient of structural complexity from simple landscapes (∼100% arable land) to complex landscapes (up to 70% semi-natural habitats such as fallows, field margins, hedges and grassland). Landscape complexity was assessed within landscape sectors of 0·5–4·0 km radius around strips.

4.  Syrphid density and in particular, the density of aphidophagous species, was higher in narrow and broad sown flower strips compared to grassy strips and wheat–wheat boundary controls at the milk-ripening stage of the wheat. In addition, species richness of aphidophagous syrphids within wheat fields adjacent to broad sown flower strips was higher at the wheat peak-ripening stage. This indicates a spillover between habitats and a positive effect of these sown flower strips on potential biocontrol of cereal aphids. Flower densities and syrphid diversity and density, respectively, were closely related.

5.  Species richness and abundance in the sown flower strips increased as the proportion of arable land in the surrounding landscape increased, suggesting that within structurally simple landscapes (at 0·5–1 km radius around the sites) syrphid flies concentrated on the most rewarding resources within the sown flower strips. Sown flower strips were more effective at increasing syrphid species richness and abundance in simple landscapes, presumably because the creation of flower resources made the greatest difference in such homogeneous, intensively managed arable landscapes.

6.  Synthesis and applications. Agri-environment schemes should take the surrounding landscape characteristics into account when considering using sown flower strips to enhance syrphid density and diversity, and their biocontrol function, in arable landscapes. Creating locally such flower strips is more effective in simple landscapes containing a high proportion of arable land, while in complex landscapes, keeping the overall diversity is important.",0

(Carabidae, Coleoptera) was compared between a strip-managed area (cereal area subdivided by strips of weeds and wild flowering herbs) and a conventionally treated cereal area. Data on phenology, biometry, quantity of the gut content and egg production were collected during the main reproduction period (April-July). Females were found to be significantly larger and heavier in the strip-managed area than in the control area. The higher weight (corrected for size) indicated better feeding conditions in the strip-managed area, which was confirmed by having better filled crops. The state of egg development and the numbers of eggs in the ovaries indicated a prolongation of the reproduction period in the strip-managed area, whereas females caught in the cereal area contained significantly fewer ripe eggs. The results of egg-laying tests in the laboratory showed the same trend but did not confirm any significant differences because of a high rate of individual variation. All measurements from females point to a higher availability of food in the strip-managed area and to an enhanced reproductive potential at this site. For males, on the other hand, the results did not reveal such a uniform trend.",1

The study was based on the comparison of two transects, one with a hedge, the other without, using mainly a dense grid of tensiometers. The influence of the bottomland hedge was located in the area where tree roots were developed, several metres upslope from the hedge, and could be observed both in the saturated and non-saturated zone, from May to December. The hedge induced a high rate of soil drying, because of the high evaporative capacity of the trees. We evaluated that water uptake by the hedge during the growing season was at least 100 mm higher than without a hedge. This increased drying rate led to a delayed rewetting of the soils upslope from the hedge in autumn, of about 1 month compared with the situation without a hedge. Several consequences of this delayed rewetting are expected: a delay in the return of subsurface transfer from the hillslope to the riparian zone, a buffering effect of hedges on floods, already observed at the catchment scale, and an increased residence time of pollutants.

We analysed territory settlement by two widespread but declining farmland buntings with contrasting nesting requirements: the Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella, a boundary-nesting species, and the Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra, a ground-nesting species. The study was conducted on farms participating in the English Higher Level Stewardship scheme to test whether territory settlement is influenced by the provision of key arable AES options. Both species settled preferentially in localities containing sown arable field margins, while Corn Bunting also settled in localities containing nectar flower mixtures. These preferences are likely to reflect foraging rather than nesting habitat requirements. Yellowhammer selected territories containing hedgerows under AES management, which are nesting rather than foraging habitat but may also provide food. Uptake by land owners of several AES options likely to provide limiting resources for farmland birds was very low, and because uptake at the landscape scale is also low, wider-scale population level benefits are likely to be constrained. However, this is one of few studies demonstrating selection of widely applied arable AES options by breeding farmland birds.",0

Population monitoring in such settings reveals substantial edge effects, although these have seldom been quantified. This study compares the abundance of common voleMicrotus arvalis (Pallas, 1778) populations at various distances from three types of wooded environment (hedgerow, copse and forest) and in two types of habitat (temporary and permanent grassland). In temporary grassland, substantial edge effects were detected along the boundaries of forests and hedgerows. At 100 m from the forest edge, voles were twice more abundant than at 50 m, four times more than at 25 m and eight times more than at 5 m. In permanent grassland, the edge effect was such that voles were practically absent up to 100 m from the forest edge. For both types of grassland, the edge effect was more pronounced for forest habitat than for hedgerows, that is, for elements with a large surface area of wooded environment. Our results suggest that landscape context may greatly affect the local abundance of voles. Given the considerable damage done byM. arvalis, the presence of wooded patches in grassland areas leads to lower vole densities in adjacent areas and this might be an alternative method to controlM. arvalis as a pest species.",1

Nevertheless, farmers frequently view these areas as non-productive and as potential sources of weeds, insect pests and diseases. Weed species richness and abundance were examined in crop fields in 2002–2003 at the Center for Environmental Farming Systems near Goldsboro, NC to determine if crop field weed infestation was associated with field margin management (managed versus unmanaged). Weed species abundance and richness were measured over two growing seasons on four occasions in crop fields along permanent transects that extended from the field edge toward the center of the field. The presence/absence of data for all plant species in the field margin was also recorded. For both margin types, managed and unmanaged, more weeds were found near the field edge than in the center of the field. Weed species richness was slightly higher in cropland bordering managed margins than in cropland along unmanaged margins. Several significant interactions led to an examination of nine dominant weed species in each field margin type and their distribution in crop fields. When all sampling dates were pooled, only 42 (40%) of 105 species identified in the field margins were observed in the crop field. Managed margins had lower species richness than unmanaged field margins—less than half the mean number of species (15 versus 6 species, respectively). Contingency table analysis did not reveal any association between plant species occurring in the margin and those found in the crop field. Furthermore, margin type and weed presence in the field margin were not effective predictors of weed occurrence in the crop field as determined by logistic regression.",0

To study habitat effects on the eastern woodrat (Neotomafloridana), we surveyed nests of the eastern woodrat in woodlands, grasslands, and croplands along 77 km of secondary roads in three counties in north-central Kansas. All nests were located in woodlands (~2% of habitat), although grasslands and croplands consti- tuted 36% and 62% of habitat surveyed, respectively. In our survey, nests were associated positively with shelterbelts (3.6 nests per 100 m of road edge) but not with shrub patches (1.1 nests per 100 m of road edge) or riparian woodlands (0.3 nests per 100 m of road edge). Consequently, we specifically censused nests in an additional 12 riparian woodlands and 12 shelterbelts. Nests of eastern woodrats were less dense in riparian wood- lands (9.4 nestslha) than in shelterbelts (55.5 nestslha). Density of woodrat nests decreased as width of a wooded area increased. Further, nests per 100 m of length of woodland did not increase as the width of woodland increased. These patterns suggest that woodland edge, not woodland interior, is the primary factor in abundance of eastern woodrats in this region. Although the eastern woodrat has previously been consid- ered a woodland species, our results suggest that this assessment is incorrect. Our observations demonstrate that anthropogenic modifica- tion of the Great Plains, in the form of planted shelterbelts and expanded riparian woodland, likely has increased the distribution and abundance of eastern woodrats, compared to the mid-1800s.

To more comprehensively assess the effectiveness of combined BMPs on water quality requires large-scale, long-term (>10 year) studies measuring key water quality parameters. One such suite of critical water quality parameters includes water clarity, total suspended solids (TSS), and total dissolved solids (TDS). To address this, Beasley Lake, a 25 ha (62 ac) oxbow lake located in a 915 ha (2,261 ac) watershed of intensive row crop agricultural activity, was studied. The lake was sediment impaired when monitoring was initiated in 1995 and was a candidate to assess the effectiveness of watershed-wide BMPs on lake water clarity (as Secchi depth), TSS concentrations, and TDS. A variety of BMPs within row crop fields, at field edges throughout the watershed, and enrollment of 112 ha (277 ac) into the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) between 1997 to 2006 focused on reducing soil erosion and concomitant sediment runoff. Selected parameters were measured approximately biweekly from 1996 to 2009. During this 14-year period, changes in row crop management and BMP implementations and alterations were observed and recorded in con- junction with targeted water quality parameters. While annual improvement in water quality occurred, distinct seasonal effects were noticeable. Observed changes in water clarity and TSS concentrations were greatest during spring and least in winter in association with increased BMPs, vegetated buffer strips west of the lake, and CRP north of the lake. Observed decreases in TDS concentrations were greatest during summer and fall in association with implemented CRP north of the lake. Reductions in spring TSS by >60% often directly increased spring water clarity by >100%. Results of this study indicate clear improvement in lake water quality with watershed-wide implementation of integrated multiple agricultural BMPs, and these improvements, manifested most strongly during spring, will assist to promote a healthy, sus- tainable lake ecosystem.",0

Two species, skylark Alauda arvensis and yellow wagtail Motacilla flava, established territories within crops. More than half of skylark territories were in autumn-sown cereals, but densities were higher in set-aside and spring-sown crops, while a conservation grassland cut for hay in late July held the highest density. Skylarks did not switch territories in winter cereals for other crops as the breeding season progressed. Weak preferences were found for spring-sown crops and weak avoidance of autumn-sown crops (i.e. there were fewer territories than expected from the area under autumn-sown crops). Skylarks showed preferences for set-aside and conservation grassland but other grassland was avoided. Skylark numbers were negatively associated with hedgerow length within tetrads. Most yellow wagtails nested in spring-sown crops, especially potatoes, for which there was a strong preference; most territories were in the largest fields. More than 75% of territories of turtle dove Streptopelia turtur were associated with residential areas, scrub and woodland, with hedges used much less often than expected from their occurrence. Grass was a strongly preferred land-use. Linnets Carduelis cannabina were mainly located in small areas of scrub and there was an association with winter oil-seed rape. Common whitethroats Sylvia communis showed preferences for hedges, especially for tall hedges, though many territories were situated in field boundaries with only scattered shrubs. Lesser whitethroats S. curruca preferred only tall hedges. Both species had more territories adjacent to grass than expected, with common whitethroat also showing a preference for winter oil-seed rape. Yellowhammers Emberiza citrinella declined over the 3 years of the study. Territories were strongly associated with tall hedges, but preferences for crops were weak. The small number of reed bunting E. schoeniclus territories were almost all by water, with a preference for adjacent grass.

Although field borders increase bobwhite habitat and increase local populations, understanding how the surrounding landscape influences bobwhite response to this management practice is critical to efficient implementation. We determined the relative influence of landscape composition and field border implementation on bobwhite densities and occupancy dynamics around crop fields in North Carolina and South Carolina, USA. We used 10-minute distance point counts to estimate density, occupancy, colonization, and extinction rates of male bobwhite around 154 agriculture fields, half of which had a fallow field border. We estimated percent of cropland, forest, pasture, early successional, and urban cover within 1- km radius buffers (314ha) surrounding all point count locations. We examined the influence of 6 predictor variables (landscape composition metrics and field border presence) on bobwhite density and occupancy dynamics. Bobwhite density increased with the presence of field borders. Conversely, bobwhite density decreased as the percentage of urban, pasture, and forest lands increased. The presence of a field border did not influence occupancy, colonization, or extinction rates. However, as the percentage of cropland increased within the landscape, bobwhite occupancy increased and as the percentage of pasture increased, bobwhite colonization decreased. As the percentage of forest and urban increased and cropland decreased, bobwhite extinction rate increased. Our results indicated that local establishment of field borders does not increase bobwhite occupancy rates, but field borders can increase densities in suitable landscapes where bobwhite are present. Habitat restoration for bobwhite will most effectively increase population densities if focused in landscapes dominated by suitable cover types, where bobwhite occurrence is high. 2013 The Wildlife Society.",0

For two growing seasons, natural enemies and herbivorous insects were sampled in fields with flowering borders and in control fields where growers maintained standard mown grass perimeters. Insects were categorized according to their trophic level and their potential pest status, and their abundance was compared between years and between treatments. Syrphid flies (Diptera: Syrphidae) were significantly more abundant in fields with conservation strips, as were plant bugs (Hemiptera: Miridae), thrips (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), and hoppers (Hemiptera: Auchenorrhyncha). Aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae), thrips, fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae), and pirate bugs (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) decreased significantly in abundance from 2007 to 2008.

Pitfall trap sampling conducted in 1996 and 1997 examined the effect of refuge strips and cover crops on enhancing the seasonal activity-density of carabid beetles. The study site followed a soybean, Glycine max L. Merr, oats, Avena sativa L., and corn, Zea mays L., rotation. Refuges consisted of a central strip of 3 perennial flowering plants, Agastache foeniculun (Pursh) O.

A total of 5,117 and 2,316 carabid beetles was captured in pitfall traps comprising 14 species in 1996 and 20 species in 1997. Carabid beetle seasonal activity-density was greater (1996) or equal (1997) in refuge strips than in control areas without refuge strips; however, the presence of a refuge strip did not alter carabid populations in the surrounding subplots in either year. In 1996, subplots containing a cover crop had significantly higher carabid beetle activity-density than subplots without a cover crop. There was no carryover effect of cover crop on beetle activity-density in 1997. Among the most abundant species, a greater proportion of captures of the fall breeding species Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger), Pterostichus permundus (Say), and the spring breeding species Poecilus lucublandus (Say) occurred in the refuge strips. The spring breeders Poecilus chalcites (Say), Harpalus herbivagus Say, and Agonum cupripenne (Say), and the phytophagous fall breeder Harpalus pensylvanicus (De Geer) occurred in greater proportions in the crop areas.

Riparian buffers reduce nonpoint source pollution in agroecosystems by storing and cycling nutrients, stabilizing streambanks, increasing infiltration, and storing water. Specific information regarding riparian buffer management is needed for land managers to maximize buffer effectiveness at reducing agricultural contaminants impairing water quality. Baseline soil properties (texture, pH, C and nutrients) of the riparian buffer surrounding a tributary of Cane Run Creek in Fayette County, KY were characterized prior to imposing three mowing regimes (intense, moderate, and no mow treatments) and one native grass regime. Measurements were made along parallel transects located 2-m and 8-m distances from the stream. Root biomass, aggregate distribution, and saturated hydraulic conductivity were measured along the 2-m transect in two consecutive years following treatment establishment. The 2-m transect soils had the highest C, pH, Ca, Zn, and sand content. The 8-m transect had the highest P, K, Mg, and clay content. Semivariogram analysis of C content indicated slight to moderate spatial dependency along the 2m transect and moderate to strong spatial dependency along the 8m transect. Root biomass increased with decreased mowing frequency at the surface depth after one year; the native grass treatment had significantly less root biomass in both years compared to mowing treatments. There was no significant treatment effect on aggregate size distribution at the surface depth in either year. Mean weight diameter and large macroaggregates decreased from 2011 to 2012. Vegetation treatment had no statistically significant effect on water stable aggregates or saturated hydraulic conductivity. Experimental semivariograms provided evidence of spatial structure at multiple scales in root biomass, aggregates, and soil C. Spatial variability occurred over a shorter lag distance in 2012 than 2011, suggesting an effect of imposed treatments slowly developing over time. This study provides important insights on riparian buffer soil properties, soil sampling strategies to detect spatial variability in riparian buffers, and length of time needed to assess effects of vegetation management regimes on riparian root biomass, soil aggregates, and hydraulic conductivity.",0

There were two treatments: in one treatment, weeds at the margins and inside the plots were regularly controlled by tillage; in the other treatment no weed control was done. Thrips and Orius were sampled by beating faba bean plants and weeds. Orius niger (Wolff) was the most abundant predatory insect species in faba bean and flowering weeds, with numbers of adults and nymphs significantly greater in plots with weedy margins than in weed-free plots. Flowering weeds did not contribute to the abundance of F. occidentalis on faba bean. Abundance of adults of Orius spp. did not coincide with the abundance of F. occidentalis on faba bean or weeds. There were significant negative associations for numbers of Orius spp. among faba bean and the weed species Lamium amplexicaule L. or Sinapis arvensis L. (P < 0.05), indicating movement of Orius individuals from the weeds to faba bean during March–April. Finally, faba bean and weeds may provide some benefits to predators, such as nectar, pollen, shelter and egg-laying sites rather than as sources of insect prey. Cultivation of faba bean could be useful for conservation and augmentation of beneficial insects, including Orius spp. Furthermore, field margins bearing flowering weeds such as S. arvensis and L amplexicaule should be protected against destructive management practices, because they host considerable numbers of the Orius species.",1

In this study, we evaluated the effects of distance from wooded habitats such as windbreaks and forest borders on the presence of native pollinators in blueberry fields in Lac-St-Jean (Quebec, Canada). Four treatments were compared: single-row, double-row, natural windbreaks, and forest borders. Pan-traps were placed at 5, 30, and 60 m from the windbreak or forest border. A total of 3878 native pollinators were collected and 81% were ground-nesting bees. The forest border was the only treatment with higher abundance and species richness on the periphery (5 m) of the field than at further distances, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of pollinators is favoured by habitats potentially offering more abundant and diverse nutritional resources. Our overall results reveal that native pollinators are distributed quite homogeneously in blueberry fields, suggesting that windbreaks are beneficial to native pollinator communities. Resume—La production du bleuet nain (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton (Ericaceae)) est fortement dependante des insectes pollinisateurs pour maximiser les rendements. Le declin des abeilles domestiques (Apis mellifera Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Apidae)) observe mondialement fragilise cette industrie qui a developpe un interet pour une source alternative de pollinisation, les pollinisateurs indigenes. On observe generalement un impact negatif de l'eloignement des habitats naturels sur l'abondance et la richesse specifique de ces communautes. Dans cette etude, nous avons evalue l'effet de l'eloignement deszones boisees telles que les haies brise-vent et les bordures de foret sur la presence des pollinisateurs indigenes dans les cultures de bleuets nains au Lac-St-Jean (Quebec, Canada). Quatre traitements ont ete compares: brise-vent a une rangee d'arbres, brise-vent a deux rangees d'arbres, brise-vent naturel et bordure de foret. Des pieges-bols ont ete places a 5, 30 et 60 m des zones boisees. Un total de 3878 pollinisateurs indigenes a ete collecte et 81% d'entre eux etaient des nicheurs de sol. L'abondance et la richesse specifique etaient plus importantes en peripherie des champs (5 m) dans les traitements bordures de foret comparativement aux autres traitements, supportant l'hypothese que la presence des pollinisateurs est favorisee par un habitat offrant potentiellement des ressources nutritionnelles plus abondantes et plus diversifiees. L'ensemble de nos resultats indique que les pollinisateurs indigenes sont distribues de facon homogene en bleuetiere, suggerant que les brise-vents ont un effet benefique sur les communautes de pollinisateurs indigenes.",1

Significantly more individuals were found in the centres (30-m position) than at the edges (3-m position). Conversely, species richness was significantly higher at the field edges than in the centres. 3 Of the ten most abundant species, Poecilus cupreus, Agonum muelleri and Pterostichus melanarius were significantly more abundant in the field centres than at the edges. Harpalus rufipes was significantly more abundant in the fields adjoining sown wildflower areas than in the fields adjoining grassy margins. 4 In conclusion, the response of carabid beetles to within-field position and adjoining habitats was species specific.

The purpose of this study was to determine if narrow BS would effectively remove dissolved inorganic N from subsurface lateral flow. Nitrate–N (NO3–N) and ammonia–N (NH3–N) concentrations in subsurface lateral flow were measured at 1 m depth in a BS system consisting of five treatments: G: strip of grass (Fescue arundinacea); GS: strip of grass and line of native shrubs (Fuchsia magellanica); GST1: strip of grass, line of shrubs and line of native trees 1 (Luma chequen); GST2: strip of grass, line of shrubs and line of native trees 2 (Drimys winteri); and C: bare soil as control. Water samples for the NO3–N and NH3–N measurements were collected between June 2012 and August 2014 in observation wells located at the inlet (input) and outlet (output) of each treatment. The analyses showed that vegetated BS had NO3–N removal efficiency ranging from 33 to 67 % (mean 52 %), with the G treatment showing the best performance in reducing NO3–N concentrations in subsurface lateral flow. The BS treatments were not effective in reducing NH3–N concentrations. The results suggested that N uptake by grass is the main process associated with the NO3–N retention capacity of vegetated BS.",0

In the United States and parts of Europe, this has led to the implementation of agricultural land preservation programs and riparian protection and replanting efforts along urban streams. The ecological benefits of such programs for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity have yet to be fully explored. We designed a study to investigate the patterns of stream macroinvertebrate community structure along a gradient of agriculture to urban development, and the patterns among urban streams that vary in the amount of intact riparian buffer. In 2001 and 2002, we sampled the 29 small headwater streams comprising the outlying tributaries of four watersheds just north of Washington, D.C., in Montgomery County, Maryland, USA. This region has had dramatic urban development over the last 50 years, yet significant efforts have been made to maintain riparian buffers and promote preservation of agricultural land. Macroinvertebrate richness was strongly related to land use, with agricultural streams exhibiting the highest macroinvertebrate diversity. Taxa richness was related negatively and linearly (no statistical threshold) to the amount of impervious surface cover. For the urban streams, there was a strong positive relationship between invertebrate diversity and riparian forest cover. Urban streams with high amounts of intact riparian forest exhibited biodiversity levels more comparable to less urban areas despite high amounts of impervious cover in their catchments. The agricultural headwater streams in this study were not only more diverse than the urban headwaters, but their levels of macroinvertebrate diversity were high compared to other published estimates for agricultural streams. These higher richness values may be due to widespread use of ''best management practices'' (BMPs), including no-till farming and the implementation of woody and herbaceous riparian buffers, which may alleviate many acute stressors caused by cultivation. These findings suggest that, if managed properly, the preservation of agricultural land from development may help conserve stream invertebrate biodiversity, and that maintenance of riparian forests even in highly urbanized watersheds may help alleviate ecological disturbances that might otherwise limit macroinvertebrate survival.",0

Little attention, however, has been paid to the ecological status of these areas despite the fact that riparian habitats in good condition can provide multiple benefits. We investigated vegetation patterns and plant-environment relationships within three categories of riparian margins in northeast Scotland. The margins were categorized as unbuffered, buffered, or reference (target), the latter representing the best sites available within the catchments. Vascular plant and soil data were collected from 41 sites along the tributaries of two rivers during 2008 and 2009. Ellenberg indicator values revealed trends of decreasing light availability ( < 0.05) and decreasing pH ( < 0.01) from unbuffered sites to buffered sites to reference sites. Multivariate analysis showed that soil parameters and channel morphology, together with canopy cover and bryophyte abundance, were discriminatory in separating species assemblages. The presence of a tree canopy layer appears to be the key instigator of change in soil conditions and corresponding plant species assemblages. An understanding of the underlying processes is important if vegetation characteristics are to be used effectively as indicators of riparian and water quality and to aid the restoration of riparian habitats.",1

1
Farmland is readily divisible into linear habitats such as hedges, and non-linear habitats such as fields and woodlots. In agricultural landscapes, conservationists have generally focused on enhancing linear habitats, but there are few data from which to judge whether or not this is a good strategy for biodiversity.

2
We investigated whether the linear or non-linear character of habitat patches, mediated by edge effects, has an impact on the abundance, diversity and richness of the small mammal communities that live within and between them.

3
In particular, we hypothesized, first, that edge effects cause narrow linear habitats to be avoided by specialists such as the bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus, but not by generalists such as the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus; secondly, that edge effects lead to specialists being present in atypical habitat, through excursions at the interface between two habitats.

4
We tested these hypotheses by live-trapping small mammals in grids in the centres of three non-linear farmland habitats (woodlots, set-aside and crop fields) and in field boundaries consisting of a series of adjoining linear habitats. We compared mammal communities in the non-linear habitats with the field boundary as a whole, and with the individual linear habitat elements within the boundary.

5
There was no evidence that specialists avoided linear habitats. Indeed, the field boundary was the most species-rich habitat surveyed, and bank voles were more abundant in linear hedgerow than in non-linear woodland. Bank voles were present in linear set-aside and in the crop edge, but never in non-linear blocks of set-aside or crop, implying that they diffused out of the hedgerow into the adjacent habitats. There was no evidence of an effect of habitat linearity on field voles Microtus agrestis, wood mice or common shrews Sorex araneus.

6
Our results suggest that on uncropped land such as set-aside, the linear or non-linear character of habitats will make little difference to small mammal abundance and diversity. We advocate similar assessments for other taxa so that the effects of farm management and habitat configuration on biodiversity can be understood more fully.",1

On the windward side of hedgerows species richness and abundance of Orthoptera were reduced (only 4 species were recorded). It is suggested that shelter from the wind and the exposure to early morning sunlight for Orthoptera on the east side of hedgerows are important factors governing their occurrence on farmland.

Here we aim to assess and to compare two riparian gray alder forests in terms of gaseous N2O and N2 fluxes and dissolved N2O, N2, and NO3(-) in the near-surface groundwater. We further determine for the first time isotopologue ratios of N2O dissolved in the riparian groundwater in order to support our assumption that it mainly originated from denitrification. The study sites, both situated in Estonia, northeastern Europe, receive contrasting N loads from adjacent uphill arable land. Whereas N2O emissions were rather small at both sites, average gaseous N2-to-N2O ratios inferred from closed-chamber measurements and He-O laboratory incubations were almost four times smaller for the heavily loaded site. In contrast, groundwater parameters were less variable among sites and between landscape positions. Campaign-based average (15)N site preferences of N2O (SP) in riparian groundwater ranged between 11 and 44 ‰. Besides the strong prevalence of N2 emission over N2O fluxes and the correlation pattern between isotopologue and water quality data, this comparatively large range highlights the importance of denitrification and N2O reduction in both riparian gray alder stands.",0

Nitrification rates were highest in agricultural streams in late spring. Nitrification was not related to streamwater NH4+ concentrations but was positively related to sediment C content (linear regression, r2 = 0.72, p < 0.001). This result suggests that benthic decomposition provided NH4+ (via mineralization) to increase sediment nitrification. Denitrification rates did not differ among landuse types but were positively related to sediment C content and streamwater NO3– concentration (multiple linear regression, R2 = 0.78, p <...",0

1.
Human-dominated landscapes are characterized by a mosaic of natural and managed eco-
systems, affecting arthropod communities on different spatial scales. Effective landscape man-
agement for functionally important organisms suffers from little understanding of organism
spillover between semi-natural habitats and adjacent crops, and of how it is affected by the
surrounding landscape.
2.
We examined syrphid abundance (Diptera: Syrphidae) in three types of linear semi-natural
habitats, differing in connectedness to annual crops and forest [forest edges (
n
= 12), forest-
connected hedges (
n
= 11) and isolated hedges (
n
= 12)], as well as in the adjacent oilseed
rape or winter wheat fields (i.e. altogether
n
= 70 sites in 35 landscapes). The landscape cir-
cles with 1 km radius around the study sites differed in the proportion of oilseed rape (rang-
ing from 0% to 35% oilseed rape) enabling us to test landscape-scale effects of oilseed rape.
3.
Aphidophagous syrphids were more abundant in forest-connected hedgerows than in for-
est edges (with isolated hedges being intermediate), and more abundant in crop fields adjacent
to hedgerows than adjacent to forest edges, indicating spillover from semi-natural habitats to
the adjacent crop fields. Aphidophagous syrphid abundance was higher in semi-natural habi-
tats adjacent to oilseed rape fields than adjacent to wheat fields if the proportion of oilseed
rape in the landscape was low (indicating local concentration).
4.
Synthesis and applications.
This study highlights the potential of hedgerows to enhance the
abundances of beneficial syrphids and their spillover to adjacent crop fields, especially when they
are connected with forests. We provide evidence that this local exchange is moderated by the
extent of mass-flowering crops in the surrounding landscapes due to local concentration. There-
fore, measurements for the improvement in local biological functioni
ng should be evaluated by
simultaneously investigating local and regio
nal aspects of crop configurations to allow for
region-specific management recommendations. Increasing the total amount of hedgerows in the
agricultural matrix under moderate landscape-
scale proportions of mass-flowering crops may
serve best for the conservation of biodiversity and augmentation of i
mportant ecosystem services
such as biological control and pollination in lands
capes dominated by agricultural cultivations.",0

Whether local species richness is dependent on local or landscape factors can be assessed by examining the relationship between local and landscape species richness. Here we studied how local species richness is related to landscape-level species richness in landscapes differing in agricultural intensity. The relationship was linear for field boundaries in intensively cultivated landscapes and non-linear in less-intensively cultivated landscapes. In landscapes containing semi-natural grasslands (on average 4% of overall land-use), the relationship was non-linear for field boundaries, but linear when considering local species richness of the grasslands themselves. These results show that local factors are more important than landscape factors in determining local species richness in landscapes which contained semi-natural grasslands. Local species richness was limited by landscape factors in intensively cultivated landscapes. This interpretation was supported by the relationship between local species richness and landscape-scale average mobility and generalist percentage of butterfly assemblages. We conclude that the management of field boundary habitat quality for butterflies is expected to be most effective in landscapes with semi-natural grasslands, the species composition of which in turn is dependent on the regional occurrence of grasslands. Based on our results, managing non-crop habitats for the conservation of habitat specialists and species with poor mobility will be most efficient in regions where patches of semi-natural grasslands occur.",0

The mobility of pollinating animals is significant to their importance but we know little about how landscape structure influences pollinator movements. Linear landscape features such as hedgerows and embankments are conspicuous features of agricultural landscape structure and are important artificial habitats in their own right. However, there has been some debate as to the function of these landscape elements as corridors between larger expanses of semi-natural habitat separated by urban and agricultural habitats. Few studies have specifically studied insect flight responses to linear landscape elements. By observing bumblebee flight behaviour along hedgerows and, by creating a medium-scale experimental array of flower patches using an artificial linear feature, we examined whether such structures can elicit an oriented flight response along them and therefore facilitate insect movement through the landscape. We found that both hedgerows and artificial linear landscape features can influence the flight directions of bumblebees (Bombus spp. Hymenoptera, Apidae), one of Europe’s most important groups of pollinators. A bioassay experiment in which Salvia pratensis (Lamiaceae) was planted into landscape patches with differing numbers of connecting hedgerows showed that this directional response can have a profound effect on plant reproductive success – plants had increased pollinator activity, pollen receipt and subsequent seed set in patches with more connections. The overall hedgerow connectedness of a landscape is therefore important both to bumblebee movement and to those plants which depend on bumblebees for pollination services. Biotic pollination of plants is fundamental to the continued functioning of most terrestrial ecosystems (Kearns",0

1. Agri-environment schemes (AES) are used extensively across Europe to address biodiversity declines in farmland. In England, Environmental Stewardship (ES) was introduced in 2005 to address the shortcomings of previous schemes, but as for schemes in other countries, assessments to date have revealed little evidence for national-scale biodiversity benefits.

2. Here, we assess the efficacy of ES in driving changes in national farmland bird populations over the period 2002–2010, using BTO/JNCC/RSPB Breeding Bird Survey data. We tested for associations between ES management options, grouped into categories reflecting intended biological effects (e.g. stubble), and species’ population growth rates, wherever benefits of management might be expected to occur.

3. We found strong evidence for positive effects of management that provides winter food resources (i.e. ES stubble and wild bird seed [WBS] crops) on population growth rates across multiple granivorous species, at three landscape scales. The results for management aiming to provide breeding season benefits (i.e. grassland, field margin and boundary [hedge, ditch] management) showed mixed patterns of positive and negative associations.

4. The results for stubble and WBS provide the first evidence for landscape-scale responses of biodiversity to AES management. The negative relationships identified may also show the importance of management context driving unforeseen predation or competition effects.

5. Synthesis and Applications. This study demonstrates that agri-environment scheme management has the potential to have national-scale effects on avian population growth rates, although our results suggest that some components of the scheme have had little effect on bird populations. Therefore, whilst this study provides the first proof-of-concept for broad-and-shallow scheme impacts on biodiversity, our results underline the importance of targeting towards population-limiting factors, here winter food resources. A combination of low uptake of key in-field options that provide winter seed and a failure to cover the late-winter period effectively explains the lack of national population responses. Such issues need to be addressed before schemes like Environmental Stewardship will achieve their goals. This study shows the value of feedback from monitoring for informing scheme design, through identifying problems and testing solutions.",2

Such predictions require an understanding of the habitat factors that determine species' abundances. We relate British farmland bird abundance at the 1 km square scale to three variable sets: landscape composition (for example, areas of woodland, urban and arable), field boundary characteristics and cropping. We then use multi-model inference to summarize model fits for each variable set and compare their explanatory power to identify the relative importance of the three forms of description of the farm landscape. The important variables across species within each set show the habitat features that are most significant for the farmland bird community.

Models comprising landscape variables provided the best fits for 21 of 31 bird species, while field boundary variables were most important for seven species and cropping variables for one. After controlling for landscape influences, we then found that field boundary variation was slightly more influential than cropping. These patterns remained when farmland-specialist species were considered alone. This shows that landscapes are the most important determinant of bird abundance and that cropping patterns and field boundary characteristics are influential only within the constraints of landscape structure. However, boundaries and, especially, crops remain important from a management perspective because they are more volatile, and can still drive population change. Important single variables that affected multiple species included woodland (predominantly negative even within farmland-dominated landscapes), hedges with trees (providing nesting habitat and song-posts) and heterogeneity both of landscapes and of cropping (predominantly positive effects). The results indicate which habitat features offer the most scope for induced population changes via management action and potentially provide relationships for input into predictive models with respect to land-use change.",0

We studied three types of live fences: planted fences of a native tree, planted fences of an exotic, and spontaneous. They were either connected to forest fragments or isolated, and were all within a pasture matrix. Spontaneous and planted live fences maintain a diverse plant (77 shrub and tree species) and bird communities (98 species). Fence types strongly differed in vegetation composition and structure. We found that by analyzing each fence characteristic independently, there was no difference in bird richness or abundance. However, there was a significant correlation when plant richness, structure, and connectivity were analyzed together. This could be the result of some variables counterbalancing each other. Birds used fences for a variety of purposes including foraging, breeding, and moving across the landscape. Native birds and plants used live fences as habitat and refuge in a landscape where large forest tracts have been lost for decades.

Some of these contaminants can increase stream eutrophication and are suspected of contributing to hypoxic conditions in the Gulf of Mexico. This research quantified effects of livestock grazing management practices and vegetative filter strip buffers on runoff depth and mass losses of total solids, nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), and ortho-phosphorus (PO4-P) under natural hydrologic conditions. Runoff data were collected from 12 rainfall events during 2001 to 2003 at an Iowa State University research farm in central Iowa, United States. Three vegetative buffers (paddock area:vegetative buffer area ratios of 1:0.2, 1:0.1, and 1:0 no buffer [control]) and three grazing management practices (continuous, rotational, and no grazing [control]) comprised nine treatment combinations (vegetative buffer ratio/grazing management practice) replicated in three 1.35 ha (3.34 ac) plot areas. The total 4.05 ha (10.02 ac) study area also included nine 0.4 ha (1.0 ac) paddocks and 27 vegetative buffer runoff collection units distributed in a randomized complete block design. The study site was established on uneven terrain with a maximum of 15% slopes and consisted of approximately 100% cool-season smooth bromegrass. Average paddock and vegetative buffer plant tiller densities estimated during the 2003 project season were approximately 62 million and 93 million tillers ha−1 (153 million and 230 million tillers ac−1), respectively. Runoff sample collection pipe leakage discovered and corrected during 2001 possibly reduced runoff depth and affected runoff contaminant mass losses data values. Consequently, 2001 runoff analysis results were limited to treatment comparisons within the 2001 season and were not compared with 2002 and 2003 data. Analysis results from 2001 showed no significant differences in average losses of runoff, total solids, NO3-N, and PO4-P among the nine vegetative buffer/grazing practice treatment combinations. Results from 2002 indicated significantly higher losses of runoff and total solids from 1:0 no buffer/rotational grazing and 1:0 no buffer/continuous grazing treatment combination plots, respectively, compared among other 2002 season treatment combinations. The 2003 results showed significantly higher runoff and total solids losses from 1:0 no buffer/no grazing treatment combination plots compared among all 2003 treatment combinations and from 1:0.1 vegetative buffer/no grazing treatment combination plots compared among all 2003 treatment combinations and with respective 2002 treatment combinations. However, the 2003 results indicated effective vegetative buffer performance with significantly lower runoff, total solids, and NO3-N losses from the larger 1:0.2 buffer area compared among the smaller 1:0.1 buffer area and 1:0 no buffer treatment combinations. The 2003 results also indicated a highly significant increase in losses of NO3-N from 1:0.1 buffer/no grazing treatment combination plots compared among other 2003 season treatment combinations and with respective 2002 treatment combinations. Overall results from this study suggest a shift from significantly higher 2002 season plot losses of continuous and rotational grazing treatment combinations to significantly higher 2003 season losses of no grazing treatment combinations. We speculate this shift to significantly higher runoff and contaminant losses from no grazing treatment combination plots during 2003 reflects the variability inherent to a complex and dynamic soil-water environment of livestock grazing areas. However, we also hypothesize the environmental conditions that largely consisted of a dense perennial cool-season grass type, high-relief landscape, and relatively high total rainfall depth may not necessarily include livestock grazing activities.",0

These organisms can disperse between non-crop habitats and crops and can benefit from resources in non-crop areas. Thus, it may be important to conserve non-crop habitats to maintain ecosystem services within crops. However, even single ecosystem services, such as pollination or predation of pests, may be provided by a complex of species. Different species may respond to landscape structure at differing spatial scales. This raises the question: What scales should conservation take place at to sustain an ecosystem service? Here, we examine variation in predation of two potato pests in response to landscape structure. Specifically, predation of Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, and green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, were quantified in potato and field-margin habitats set in landscapes that varied at different scales. At a local scale (meters), potato fields of different sizes were bordered by different areas of grassy field margin. At a broad scale (kilometers), these habitats were set in landscapes composed of varying percentages of non-crop habitat. Predation of both pests was associated with landscape structure, but this relationship occurred at different scales for each pest and interacted differently with habitat type. Predation of L. decemlineata eggs was greater in field margins than in the potato crop and increased in both habitats when field margins were large relative to potatoes. In contrast, aphid predation in field margins increased with the area of non-crop habitat within 1.5 km, but did not change in adjacent potato. These data emphasize that, even a single ecosystem service, such as predation of pests, can be influenced by landscape structure at multiple scales. More generally, it may be necessary to conserve heterogeneity both at local scales (individual farm fields) and broad scales (entire mosaic landscapes) to maintain ecosystem services. This may be especially true for ecosystem services that are the aggregate result of the actions of many species or ecological processes.",1

Enhancing floral resources is a widely accepted measure for promoting bees in agricultural landscapes, but effectiveness varies considerably between landscapes and regions. We hypothesize that this variation is mainly driven by a combination of the direct effects of measures on local floral resources and the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape. To test this, we established wildflower strips in four European countries, using the same seed mixture of forage plants specifically targeted at bees. We used a before-after control-impact approach to analyse the impacts of wildflower strips on bumblebees, solitary bees and Red List species and examined to what extent effects were affected by local and landscape-wide floral resource availability, land-use intensity and landscape complexity. Wildflower strips generally enhanced local bee abundance and richness, including Red-listed species. Effectiveness of the wildflower strips increased with the local contrast in flower richness created by the strips and furthermore depended on the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape, with different patterns for solitary bees and bumblebees. Effects on solitary bees appeared to decrease with increasing amount of late-season alternative floralresources in the landscape, whereas effects on bumblebees increased with increasing early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability.Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the effects of wildflower strips on bees are largely driven by the extent to which local flower richness is increased. The effectiveness of this measure could therefore be enhanced by maximizing the number of bee forage species in seed mixtures, and by management regimes that effectively maintain flower richness in the strips through the years. In addition, for bumblebees specifically, our study highlights the importance of a continuous supply of food resources throughout the season. Measures that enhance early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability, such as the cultivation of oilseed rape, can benefit bumblebees by providing the essential resources for colony establishment and growth in spring. Further research is required to determine whether, and under what conditions, wildflower strips result in actual population-level effects.

Surface application of aluminium (Al)-based water treatment residuals (Al-WTRs) to vegetated buffer strip (VBS) soils can enhance P removal from surface runoff during single runoff events. However, the longer-term effects on P removal in VBSs following application of products such as Al-WTR remain uncertain. We used field experimental plots to examine the long-term effects of applying a freshly generated Al-WTR to VBSs on dissolved P export during multiple runoff events, occurring between 1 day and 42 weeks after the application of Al-WTR. Vegetated buffer strip plots amended with Al-WTR significantly reduced soluble reactive P and total dissolved P concentrations in surface runoff compared to both unamended VBS plots and control plots. However, the effectiveness of Al-WTR decreased over time, by approximately 70 % after 42 weeks compared to a day following Al-WTR application. Reduced performance did not appear to be due to drying of Al-WTR in the field. Instead, the development of preferential flow paths as well as burying of Al-WTR with freshly deposited sediments may explain these observations. Better understanding of the processes controlling long-term P removal by Al-WTR is required for effective management of VBSs.",1

Currently, 41% of managed hedgerow length in England forms part of three Agri-Environment Scheme (AES) options, which specify a reduction in hedgerow cutting frequency from the most common practice of annual cutting. These AES options aim to increase the availability of flowers and berries for wildlife, but there has been little rigorous testing of their efficacy or estimates of the magnitude of their effects. We conducted a factorial experiment on hawthorn hedges to test the effects of (i) cutting frequency (every 1, 2 or 3 years) and (ii) timing of cutting (autumn vs. winter) on the abundance of flowers and berry resources. Results from 5 years show that hedgerow cutting reduced the number of flowers by up to 75% and the biomass of berries available over winter by up to 83% compared to monitored uncut hedges. Reducing cutting frequency from every year to every 3 years resulted in 2.1 times more flowers and a 3.4 times greater berry mass over 5 years. Cutting every 2 years had an intermediate effect on flower and berry abundance, but the increase in biomass of berries depended on cutting in winter rather than autumn. The most popular AES option is cutting every 2 years (32% of English managed hedgerow length). If these hedges were managed under a 3 year cutting regime instead, we estimate that biomass of berries would increase by about 40%, resulting in a substantial benefit for wildlife.",0

To date, variable responses of abundance, species richness, and species diversity of small mammals have been recorded in riparian and upland habitats. To address this variability, we provide a detailed analysis of seasonal changes in abundance and diversity of terrestrial small-mammal communities over a 7-year period within an agricultural landscape in south-central British Columbia, Canada. We tested the hypotheses (H) that abundance, species richness, and species diversity of communities of small mammals (H1), and demographic parameters of reproduction, recruitment, and survival of the major species: deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and montane vole (Microtus montanus) (H2), would be higher in riparian than upland habitats. Mean total abundance of small mammals was higher in summer and winter, and species richness higher in summer, in riparian than hedgerow habitats. Winter population data supported the total and species abundance patterns for small mammals, but species richness was similar, and diversity lower, in riparian than hedgerow sites during winter periods. Deer mice were the dominant species in terms of abundance and reproductive output for pregnancies and recruitment, but not survival, in riparian sites. Montane voles were similar in abundance and demographic parameters in the two habitats. House mice (Mus musculus) preferred hedgerows and wandering shrews (Sorex vagrans) riparian sites. Demographic parameters for deer mice and montane voles indicated that both riparian and hedgerow sites were “source” rather than “sink” habitats, and likely contribute to maintenance of mammal diversity in agricultural landscapes.",0

The effects of windbreak on maize yields have not been assessed in a well-documented manner in eastern Canada, which is a major influential barrier limiting their adoption by farmers. In this study, we investigated the spatial distribution of maize grain yield in the leeward side of mature (average age, 30-years-old) single-tree row windbreaks that were located on four farm sites in southern Quebec, Canada. We determined whether the sign and magnitude of windbreak effects on spatial patterns of maize yield varied across contrasting years with respect to rainfall conditions. The greatest yield variation was observed at the tree-crop interface (within 0.5–1H, where H = tree height), where substantial yield reductions occurred. In two sites, the magnitude of negative windbreak effects on maize yield at the tree-crop interface decreases in the wetter years. We found important maize yield variation among sampling positions between 2H and 20H (here considered as the shelter zone), with yield values often significantly higher than at 24H (here considered as a control zone with negligible tree shelter effects). The magnitude of this yield variation in the shelter zone generally decreased in the wetter years. In most cases, we estimated that the net effect of windbreak on maize yield (0.5–20H vs. 24H) was negligible. Significant net positive (16 %) or negative (−6 %) effects of windbreaks on maize production were found at one site only and occurred on two different years. We conclude that the sign and magnitude of windbreak effects on spatial patterns of maize grain vary considerably across farms and depend upon temporal variation in rainfall conditions in eastern Canada.",0

Vegetative buffers in agricultural landscapes can provide a range of important ecological services, including conservation of native flora and fauna, enhancement of biological pest control and reduction of agrochemical drift. Typically, studies addressing the impact of such vegetative elements focus on one particular benefit. We investigated whether the benefits of field margins that had been established for conservation of northern bobwhite quail Colinus virginianus populations extended to the enhancement of biological pest control in adjacent conservation tillage cotton fields. 2. Densities of a selection of insect species and the predation and parasitism rates of insect pest species were measured in first- and second-year field margins established for bobwhite quail as well as in an adjacent cotton crop. 3. Second-year field margins yielded higher densities of all species sampled, with the exception of staphylinids and cotton aphids. Despite this, thrips and their predator, Orius insidiosus, were the only species that were also more abundant in the adjacent cotton field. Tachinids and Trichogramma and Lygus species, appeared to prefer the field margin vegetation over the cotton. 4. Overall, the impact of second-year margins on the cotton crop did not significantly differ from first-year margins with regard to pest occurrence or biological control. 5. Analysis of the sugar content in Meteorus autographae, a generalist parasitoid of Lepidoptera larvae, suggested that this species is severely food-limited in the field margins established for bobwhite quail. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that field margins designed to specifically benefit bobwhite quail may be unsuitable for providing other ecological services. By making small adjustments in the vegetative composition of these field margins, such as adding early season nectar-producing plants, it may be feasible to combine biodiversity and pest-control benefits and thereby optimize the overall ecological services to be gained.",0

The cross-sectional survey of pasture runoff was conducted on 34 pastures on five different dairies over 2 yr under varying conditions of precipitation, slope, manure management, and use of conservation practices such as vegetative filter strips. The MMS cross-sectional survey consisted of samples collected during 1 yr on nine different dairies from six loafing barns, nine primary lagoons, 12 secondary lagoons, and six irrigation sample points. Pasture runoff samples were additionally analyzed for Cryptosporidium sp. and Giardia duodenalis, whereby detectable concentrations occurred sporadically at higher FCB concentrations resulting in poor correlations with FCB. Prevalence of both parasites was lower relative to high-use areas studied simultaneously on these same farms. Application of manure to pastures more than 2 wk in advance of storm-associated runoff was related to a > or =80% reduction in FCB concentration and load compared to applications within 2 wk before a runoff event. For every 10 m of buffer length, a 24% reduction in FCB concentration was documented. A one-half (75%), one (90%), and two (99%) log10 reduction in manure FCB concentration was observed for manure holding times in MMS of approximately 20, 66, and 133 d, respectively. These results suggest that there are several management and conservation practices for working farms that may result in reduced FCB fluxes from agricultural operations.",1

Plant communities in ﬁeld margins either devel-oped spontaneously or were sown with diﬀerent seedmixtures of grasses and forbs. Margins were mown twicea year and the cuttings were either removed or leftin situ. Three years after establishment, the importanceof the unsown rhizomatous species Elytrigia repens andUrtica dioica was signiﬁcantly higher in the unsowncommunity or when cuttings were not removed aftermowing. Seed dispersal from the margin into adjacentcrops was important in the unsown community duringthe ﬁrst year after establishment. Between 82% and 99%of the seeds were disseminated within 4 m from themargin strip. Overall risk of contaminating the adjacentcrop with weeds originating from the ﬁeld margin stripwas concentrated within a few metres of the crop edge.In order to minimise the dissemination of weed speciesand invasion by noxious vegetatively propagated weedson nutrient-rich land, it is recommended that ﬁeldmargins are established by sowing and cuttings removedafter each cut.Keywords: anemochorous species, rhizomatous species,cutting, margin strips, buffer, dispersal, wind.D",1

There is currently no curative treatment available to control wireworms, and preventive treatments are mainly chemical. We therefore need to better understand factors that rule damage for developing agroecological control strategies. In this investigation, we tested the effect of agricultural practices and local landscape on wireworm damage in maize crops. We surveyed wireworm damage in 341 fields under various conditions in western France in 2011 and 2012. We used in particular a random forest algorithm to impute missing values and an automated model selection routine to select the best beta regression model. Our results show that the occurrence of grassland in the rotation increases wireworm damage. Tillage also shows a high influence, though varying with season and year. Wireworm damage is decreased by the presence of hedges or cultivated crops at the field border, whereas it is increased by the presence of grassland at the field border. Overall, our findings provide some insights to develop preventive solutions for the sustainable control of wireworms, as well as a framework for data processing to analyze a wide range of similar situations involving other crops and pests.",0

The most effective means of increasing abundance and diversity of bumblebees on farmland is to sow simple, low cost mixtures of dicotyledons rich in pollen and nectar, as prescribed under the UK agri-environment schemes. The potential benefits of this management prescription for butterflies are unknown. Similarly, more information is needed on how to manage this habitat to maximise the provision of pollen and nectar resources whilst protecting breeding habitat for butterflies. This study aimed to devise mixtures and cutting management regimes which address these issues. We found significant effects of seed mixture, timing and frequency of cutting, and removal of cut material on vegetation composition, flower resource availability and pollinators (the abundance, species richness and temporal distribution of butterflies and bumblebees, including males and queens, attracted to the mixtures). We recommend that nectar flower mixtures are refined by the inclusion of the best performing species to provide mid- and late-season forage resources (Trifolium spp., Lotus corniculatus and Centaurea nigra), and the removal of competitive grass species. Summer cutting in May or early June, with removal of herbage where possible, should be applied to half the patch to extend the flowering season, and minimise damage to butterfly breeding habitat. This should be accompanied by the typical autumn cut to the whole patch. Even with best management practice, such nectar flower mixtures are only effective for 3–4 years and this should be recognised in policies aimed at enhancing pollinator populations in agricultural landscapes.",0

A field study was conducted to evaluate the ability of buffer strips enhanced with drinking water treatment residuals (WTRs) to control runoff P losses from surface-applied biosolids characterized by high water-extractable P (4 g kg(-)(1)). Simulated rainfall (62.4 mm h(-1)) was applied to grassed plots (3 m x 10.7 m including a 2.67 m downslope buffer) surface-amended with biosolids at 102 kg P ha(-1) until 30 min of runoff was collected. With buffer strips top-dressed with WTR (20 Mg ha(-1)), runoff total P (TP = 2.5 mg L(-1)) and total DP (TDP = 1.9 mg L(-1)) were not statistically lower (alpha = 0.05) compared to plots with unamended grass buffers (TP = 2.7 mg L(-1); TDP = 2.6 mg L(-1)). Although the applied WTR had excess capacity (Langmuir P maxima of 25 g P kg(-1)) to sorb all runoff P, kinetic experiments suggest that sheet flow travel time across the buffers ( approximately 30 s) was insufficient for significant P reduction. Effective interception of dissolved P in runoff water by WTR-enhanced buffer strips requires rapid P sorption kinetics and hydrologic flow behavior ensuring sufficient runoff residence time and WTR contact in the buffer. Substantial phosphate-adsorbent contact opportunity may be more easily achieved by incorporating WTRs into P-enriched soils or blending WTRs with applied P sources.",1

On 20 hectares of organic farming, a network of field margins has been laid down to investigate three main questions: 1. Does an increased biodiversity in a farming system contribute to the suppression of pest populations? 2. How far can field margins be apart? 3. What vegetation diversity is required in order to achieve pest populations suppression? Pitfall traps and yellow water pans in field margins and crops are used to assess antagonists’ densities. Samples of key pests and damage assessments in different crops are related to the distance from the nearest margins. The first results out of these massive data sets are presented. In both wheat and potato, aphid incidence appeared unrelated to the distance from the nearest crop edge. However, aphid densities were much lower in the BIOdivers subsystem with field margins compared to the control system. A similar pattern was observed for carrot fly (Psila rosae; Diptera, Psilidae) damage in carrots. This reoccurring pattern suggests that in the field margin network of the BIOdivers system, the total assemblage of (generalists and specialists) predators and parasitoids exert a degree of pest suppression in several crops, over distances of at least 50 m.",0

(2001) for the scenic beauty assessment. The study areas consisted of three original, untreated, and 15 modified rural landscapes representing a variety of different activities. The scenic beauty of the landscapes was evaluated through pairwise comparisons of the responses of 68 people. Furthermore, attitudes towards environmental values, water protection, buffer strips and subsidies to agriculture were obtained. The respondents found the maintained buffer strips more pleasing than unmaintained strips and considered that the quality of watercourses was increased by buffer strips along them. A suitable width for the buffer strip along main ditches, brooks and waterways was regarded, on average, to be wider than the current recommendations. Although the opinions of farmers were basically in line with the existing recommendations, farmers' opininons on the second and third most important effects of buffer strips, an increase in weeds and a decrease in cultivated land, clearly differed from those of the other respondents. Afforestation, lack of building maintenance and abandoned fields were considered to be the most important factors impacting rural landscapes.

In the case of methane (CH 4 ), these systems have the potential to serve as sinks of CH 4 or may provide favorable conditions for CH 4 production. This study quantifies CH 4 flux from soils of riparian buffer systems comprised of three vegetation types and compares these fluxes with those of adjacent crop fields. We measured soil properties and diel and seasonal variations of CH 4 flux in 7 to 17 yr-oLd re-established riparian forest buffers, warm-season and cool-season grass filters, and an adjacent crop field located in the Bear Creek watershed in central Iowa. Forest buffer and grass filter soils had significantly lower bulk density (P < 0.01); and higher pH (P < 0.01), total carbon (TC) (P < 0.01), and total nitrogen (TN) (P < 0.01) than crop field soils. There was no significant relationship between CH 4 flux and soil moisture or soil temperature among sites within the range of conditions observed. Cumulative CH 4 flux was -0.80 kg CH 4 -C ha -1 yr -1 in the cropped field, -0.46 kg CH 4 -C ha -1 yr -1 within the forest buffers, and 0.04 kg CH 4 -C ha -1 yr -1 within grass filters, but difference among vegetation covers was not significant. Results suggest that CH 4 flux was not changed after establishment of perennial vegetation on cropped soils, despite significant changes in soil properties.",1

The most lost nutrient is nitrogen yet the phosphorus from soluble fertilizers is also lost. These nutrients reach into surface waters where determine eutrophication phenomenon. In order to implement the objectives of Water Frame Directive 2000/60/CE there have been searched methods for mitigation the nutrient pollution from slope soils. These methods are: - the using of organic - mineral fertilizers (L120) instead of soluble phosphorus fertilizers (superphosphates); - buffer strips at the bottom of the slope;- filtering materials for water from creeks. The applying of these methods have contributed to the reduction of the nutrient losses (nitrogen and phosphorus) from slope soils with values ranging between 38-41% by applying organic - mineral fertilizer and by 52-64% when buffer strips were installed. The using of straw ballots as filtering materials for creek water has determined the reduction of nutrient losses by 72%. This way, the using of organic - mineral fertilizer on lignite base (L-120) has determined the diminishing of phosphorus losses on slope soils due to bonding phosphorus from this fertilizer in an organic - mineral matrix that speeds up the retrogradation and solubilisation processes of phosphorus. The using of grass buffer strips of 10 m wide on level curves at the bottom of the slope along Preajba creek has determined an obvious decreasing of the eroded soil quantity, of humus and nutrient losses due to better retention by root system and its higher density. Straw ballots across the course of a creek are a good filter for running waters. The straw action is similar with soil colloidal complex, they retain chemical ions from water like: NO3, NH4, K, PO4, etc. By using straw ballots there can be avoided the eutrophication phenomenon of the surface waters. The using of crops like natural and sown pasture as well as cereals could be a method to mitigate nutrient losses on slopes. Wide row crops should be avoided as much as possible.",1

Increased intensification in agricultural grasslands has led to well-documented declines in the associated flora. Manipulation of field margins for biodiversity enhancement in arable systems has been extensively investigated. However, there is a paucity of corresponding long-term research within intensively managed grasslands. 2. We investigated a combination of establishment and management methods to enhance botanical diversity of newly established field margins in intensively managed grasslands. Three methods of field margin establishment were investigated including fencing, natural regeneration by rotavation, or seeding with a wildflower mixture. Subsequent sward management by either grazing or mowing was tested at three margin widths. Success of establishment was addressed in terms of persistence of species richness, plant community composition and incidence of noxious weeds. 3. Seeding with a wildflower mixture was the most successful establishment method to enhance plant species richness and this effect persisted throughout the 7 years of the experiment ( = 16 center dot 4 +/- 0 center dot 43 SE plant species richness per 1 x 3 m2 quadrat). Mown ( = 6 center dot 01 +/- 0 center dot 30 SE) and rotavated ( = 9 center dot 7 +/- 0 center dot 34 SE) treatments contained significantly fewer plant species; grazed controls contained 9 center dot 83 +/- 0 center dot 24 species. 4. Grazing led to a significant, but modest increase in species richness in fenced and rotavated plots compared to the mowing treatment, but had no effect in seeded plots. Grazing also led to an increased frequency and cover of competitive grasses in the seeded treatment. 5. Although margin width was not found to significantly influence species richness, there was increased herb cover and reduced abundance of noxious weeds in the wider seeded margins. 6.Synthesis and applications. The choice of establishment method and subsequent management of grassland field margins significantly affected their conservation value. The botanical diversity of margins within intensively managed pasture can be enhanced by sowing wildflower seed mixtures. This diversity can be maintained over time through appropriate management, i.e. either the reduction of high grazing pressure by seasonal fencing, or annual mowing. Management approaches that involve minimal change are currently adopted in many agri-environment schemes (such as fencing and/or the cessation of nutrient inputs) but did not produce swards of conservation value in this study.",0

Most previous studies have focused primarily on the role of vegetation and/or soil physical properties in these ecosystem services. Few studies have investigated the soil microbial community of VFS. Therefore, we examined potential differences in soil microbial community characteristics of claypan soil planted to VFS with differing vegetation and a traditional row-crop system in a maize–soybean rotation. Samples were tested for soil microbial function and community structure using dehydrogenase and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis enzyme assays and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, respectively. The grass VFS soil exhibited the greatest dehydrogenase activity levels and FDA activity was greater in the grass and agroforestry (i.e., tree–grass) VFS soils relative to the cropland soil. The PLFA analysis revealed community structural differences underlying these functional differences. The agroforestry VFS soil was characterized by a greater proportion of total bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, anaerobic bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi than the cropland soil. The grass VFS soil shared some characteristics with the cropland soils; but the grass VFS supported greater mycorrhizal fungi and protozoa populations. This work highlights differences in soil microbial function and community structure in VFS relative to cropland soil 12 years post VFS establishment. It also enhances our fundamental knowledge regarding soil microorganisms in VFS, which may aid in explaining some ecosystem services provided by VFS (e.g., decomposition of organic agrichemicals).",0

Despite their importance, the microbial community structures of riparian buffer zones remains poorly defined. Our objectives for this study were twofold: first, to characterize the microbial populations found in riparian buffer zone soils; and second, to determine if microbial community structure could be linked to denitrification enzyme activity (DEA). To achieve these objectives, we investigated the microbial populations of a riparian buffer zone located downslope of a pasture irrigated with swine lagoon effluent, utilizing DNA sequencing of the 16S rDNA, DEA, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) of the denitrification genes nirK, nirS, and nosZ. Clone libraries of the 16S rDNA gene were generated from each of twelve sites across the riparian buffer with a total of 986 partial sequences grouped into 654 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The Proteobacteria were the dominant group (49.8% of all OTUs), with the Acidobacteria also well represented (19.57% of all OTUs). Analysis of qPCR results identified spatial relationships between soil series, site location, and gene abundance, which could be used to infer both incomplete and total DEA rates.",0

The purpose of this study was to determine the fate of NO3 in shallow groundwater moving along a lateral flowpath from a grass seed cropping system through an undisturbed mixed-species herbaceous riparian area. Soil A (30-45 cm) and C horizon (135-150 cm) NO3, dissolved oxygen, and nitrous oxide concentrations were significantly higher in the cropping system than the adjacent riparian area. Nitrate concentrations in both horizons of the riparian soil were consistently at or below 0.05 mg N L(-1) while cropping system concentrations ranged from 1 to 12 mg N L(-1). Chloride data suggested that NO3 dilution occurred from recharge by precipitation. However, a sharp decrease in NO3/Cl ratios as water moved into the riparian area indicated that additional dilution of NO3 concentrations was unlikely. Riparian area A horizon soil water had higher dissolved organic carbon than the cropping system and when the riparian soil became saturated, available electron acceptors (O2, NO3) were rapidly reduced. Dissolved inorganic carbon was significantly higher in the riparian area than the cropping system for both horizons indicating high biological activity.

In the South-Western France, the evolution of agricultural practices occurs in two opposite ways. On one hand, the intensification of agriculture leads to simplify the landscape by hedgerows removal, grasslands ploughing and drainage for corn cultivation. On the other hand, the decreasing numbers of cattle and sheep conduct the less fertile parts of the territory to evolve into fallow. These two processes are closely linked on a same territory and important interactions exist between intensive agricultural areas and semi-natural communities. To understand the importance of these interactions and their role in ecological stability of landscapes, we use passerine bird communities as an ecological indicator. We modelized the relationships between birds and landscape structure from 256 releves. Each releve includes a bird count point of 20 mn and a description of the landscape feature on the surrounding 6.25 ha. An ordination of the releves along the main ecological gradients was realized using Correspondence Analysis. Then, these ordinations where related to the landscape structure with Stepwise and Multiple Regression Analysis. The rate of woody area, the hedgerow network complexity and the rate of fallow land are the main ecological gradients. We have used this model to measure the importance of the changes induced on landscape by a range of management practices differing in intensity. To achieve this aim we compare the displacement of 116 releves along the ecological gradients between 1983 and 1988. The changes occurring both in bird composition and landscape structure reveal the ecological impacts of the different management practices (hedgerow removal, drainage, ploughing, decreasing grazing pressure). We examine the behaviour of ecological diversity of landscape units differing in structure and use.",2

Outbreaks of the aphid in Ontario are often spotty in distribution, with some geographical areas affected severely and others with few or no aphid populations occurring in soybean for the duration of the season. A. glycines spend summers on soybean and overwinter on buckthorn, a shrub that is widespread in southern Ontario and is commonly found in agricultural hedgerows and at the margins of woodlots. A. glycines likely use both short distance migratory flights from buckthorn and longer distance dispersal flights in the search for acceptable summer hosts. This study aims to model colonization of soybean fields by A. glycines engaged in early-season migration from overwintering hosts. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was used to rank numerous competing linear and probit models using field parameters to predict aphid presence, colonization, and density. The variable that best modeled aphid density in soybean fields in the early season was the ratio of buckthorn density to field area, although dramatic differences in relationships between the parameters were observed between study years. This study has important applications in predicting areas that are at elevated risk of developing economically damaging populations of soybean aphid and which may act as sources for further infestation.",0

When modeling the hydrology of VF, it is often assumed that overland flow is planar, but our research indicates that it can be two-dimensional with converging and diverging pathways. Our hypothesis is that flow convergence will negatively influence the sediment trapping capability of VF. The objectives were to develop a two-dimensional modeling approach for estimating sediment trapping in VF and to investigate the impact of converging overland flow on sediment trapping by VF. In this study, the performance of a VF that has field-scale flow path lengths with uncontrolled flow direction was quantified using field experiments and hydrologic modeling. Simulations of water flow processes were performed using the physically based, distributed model MIKE SHE. A modeling approach that predicts sediment trapping and accounts for converging and diverging flow was developed based on the University of Kentucky sediment filtration model. The results revealed that as flow convergence increases, filter performance decreases, and the impacts are greater at higher flow rates and shorter filter lengths. Convergence that occurs in the contributing field (in-field) upstream of the buffer had a slightly greater impact than convergence that occurred in the filter (in-filter). An area-based convergence ratio was defined that relates the actual flow area in a VF to the theoretical flow area without flow convergence. When the convergence ratio was 0.70, in-filter convergence caused the sediment trapping efficiency to be reduced from 80% for the planar flow condition to 64% for the converging flow condition. When an equivalent convergence occurred in-field, the sediment trapping efficiency was reduced to 57%. Thus, not only is convergence important but the location where convergence occurs can also be important.",0

Two years of sap flow data collected from corn plants in a sheltered (3H) and unsheltered (25H) areas in a field near Ogden, Iowa, were used for model testing. Results showed that the CERES-Maize model simulated daily plant transpiration well in both sheltered and unsheltered areas with RMSE of 0.53 mm d""1 (3H) and 0.75 mm (25H) in 2001, and 0.85 mm d""1 (3H) and 0.59 mm d""1 (25H) in 2002.

Here, we use rRNA 16S gene sequencing to assess both the level of parasitism by Aphidiinae primary parasitoids and parasitoid identity on a large sample of aphids collected in cultivated and uncultivated agricultural habitats in Western France. We used these data to construct ecological networks to assess the level of compartmentalization between aphid and parasitoid food webs of cultivated and uncultivated habitats. We evaluated the extent to which uncultivated margins provided a resource for parasitoids shared between pest and nonpest aphids. We compared the observed quantitative ecological network described by our molecular approach to an empirical qualitative network based on aphid–parasitoid interactions from traditional rearing data found in the literature. We found that the molecular network was highly compartmentalized and that parasitoid sharing is relatively rare between aphids, especially between crop and noncrop compartments. Moreover, the few cases of putative shared generalist parasitoids were questionable and could be due to the lack of discrimination of cryptic species or from intraspecific host specialization. Our results suggest that apparent competition mediated by Aphidiinae parasitoids is probably rare in agricultural areas and that the contribution of field margins as a source of these biocontrol agents is much more limited than expected. Further large-scale (spatial and temporal) studies on other crops and noncrop habitats are needed to confirm this.",1

Hedgerows provide an important habitat for wildlife including invertebrates, representing a large proportion of semi-natural habitat patches in the modern agricultural landscapes of the UK and Europe. Around 40% of hedgerow length in England is managed under agri-environment scheme (AES) options, which specify less frequent cutting and advise cutting in winter.
2. Hedgerow management can alter habitat structure and quality, potentially influencing invertebrate community structure. We assessed the impacts of management treatments on moth communities and their parasitoids. Two treatments (‘cutting frequency’: once every 1, 2, or 3 years, and ‘cutting time’: autumn vs. winter) were applied to a long-running hedgerow experiment, mimicking AES prescriptions. Moth larvae were collected from the hedgerows, identified and reared to determine parasitism. Hedgerow structure and foliar quality were quantified and related to changes in moth abundance, diversity, species richness, and parasitism.
3. Hedgerow management did not significantly affect overall abundance of moth larvae, but did affect the abundance of certain feeding guilds and trophic interactions with parasitoids. Concealed moth larvae (mining, tentiform, and case bearing) were more abundant on hedgerows cut infrequently (every 2 or 3 years vs. annually). Parasitism rates were higher on hedgerows cut less often, when these were cut in autumn. There was a strong trend towards greater moth species richness and diversity on winter cut hedgerows.
4. Agri-environment scheme management can thus have complex effects on invertebrate communities. The abundance of some moths may be positively affected by AES hedgerow management and this can have knock-on effects on parasitoid abundance.",0

Displacement and speed of Pterostichus melanarius, Carabus auratus and Poecilus spp. were higher in the crops than in the grassy strips, except for the speed of C. auratus. Among the four species C. auratus, P. melanarius, Pterostichus niger, and Poecilus spp., C. auratus revealed the highest displacement and speed, whereas no significant differences were found between the other three species. P. melanarius showed higher displacement and speed in wheat than in red-clover or pumpkin. Speed and displacement of P. melanarius differed between spring and autumn generations in wheat or red-clover. When they were released at a junction of arable crop and field strips, C. auratus moved indifferently to either arable field or field margins/strips, whereas P. melanarius moved directly to crop centres. At the field margin, Poecilus spp. preferred to move along a grassy strip, while it moved irrespective from the grassy strips in a central site. C. nemoralis and P. niger preferred to move within the grassy strips.

We compared northern bobwhite covey densities on 1,088 paired row-crop fields with and without native herbaceous buffers in 13 states during autumn, 2006-2008. We used a 2-stage random effects modeling approach that incorporates the effective area as an offset in generalized linear mixed models to assess regional relationships among autumn bobwhite covey densities and covariates of field type (i.e., fields with vs. without native herbaceous buffers), ecological region, year, survey week, and contracted vegetative cover (i.e., planting native grasses and forbs vs. establishing through natural regeneration). Covey density was correlated with year and interaction effects of field type and ecological region. The year effect suggested annual variation in covey densities, whereas the field type by ecological region interaction suggested covey response to buffers was dependent on spatial location, likely reflecting differences in buffer establishment, succession, and characteristics of the surrounding landscape among regions. Mean fitted covey density on fields across all survey sites was 0.047 (� 0.008 bootstrap standard error (BSE)) and 0.031 coveys/ha (� 0.003 BSE) on row-crop fields with and without herbaceous buffers, respectively.

Disproportionate response to buffers in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley and Southeastern Coastal Plain suggests native herbaceous habitats might be limiting during autumn in these regions, whereas lack of response in the Eastern Tallgrass Prairie, Central Hardwoods, and central Texas regions suggests that herbaceous habitat either was not limiting or buffers failed to provide adequate requirements for bobwhites during autumn. Selection of other habitats to meet security and thermoregulatory needs might have resulted in lack of response in these regions. Native herbaceous cover provided by buffers can provide critical habitat in row-crop agricultural systems in some regions, and can contribute to regional population recovery objectives of the Northern Bobwhite Conservation Initiative (NBCI). However, range-wide NBCI recovery objectives will best be met through multiple conservation practices in row-crop agricultural systems. 2013 The Wildlife Society.",1

Stream riparian zones are considered important ecological ecotones that decrease the NO3− load of ground water discharging into streams. This study uses NO3−/Cl− ratios, natural abundances of15N and18O in NO3−, and an in situ15NO3− tracer experiment to evaluate NO3− reducing processes occurring in ground water within a narrow grassed buffer strip bordering a stream in an agricultural watershed. The NO3−/Cl− ratios (1.9-0.0 [M/M]) indicate that both NO3− consuming processes and mixing of two ground water flow regimes with different NO3− loads contribute to the drop observed in ground water NO3− concentrations within the riparian zone. δ15N and δ18O of the ground water NO3− within the riparian zone (δ15N = 5.1 to 48.8 %c; δ18O = 1.1 to 17.8 %c) were enriched compared to the ground water below the adjacent cultivated field (δ15N = 3.8 to 10.1 %0; δ18O = 0.5 to 6.2 %c). A significant linear relationship (r2=0.97) between ground water δ15N and δ18O in NO3− was found, which is consistent with NO3− consumption by microbial denitrification. The estimated enrichment factors for15N are a factor of 1.5 higher than for18O. The in situ15NO3− tracer experiment conclusively confirmed that denitrification is occurring within the ground water of the riparian zone and demonstrates that denitrification rates can be directly measured in situ.",0

Beef cattle manure was applied to 0.75 m wide by 4.0 m long plots established on an Aksarben silty clay loam located in southeast Nebraska. Manure was added at rates required to meet none or the 1, 2, or 4 year nitrogen requirements for corn. Runoff water quality was measured during three 30 min simulated rainfall events. Manure application rate significantly affected dissolved phosphorus (DP) and total phosphorus (TP) loads in runoff on the plots without a grass hedge. However, DP and TP loads were not significantly affected by manure application rate on the plots containing a hedge. The hedge reduced the mean load of DP in runoff from 0.69 to 0.08 kg ha-1 and the load of TP from 1.05 to 0.13 kg ha-1. When averaged across manure application rates, 0.11 kg NO3-N ha-1, 0.02 kg NH4-N ha-1, and 0.49 kg total nitrogen (TN) ha-1 were measured from the plots with a hedge, compared to 0.39 kg NO3-N ha-1, 0.55 kg NH4-N ha-1, and 2.52 kg TN ha-1 from the plots without a hedge. For the plots with a grass hedge, runoff loads of DP and TP where manure was applied were similar to values obtained with no manure application. Each of the runoff water quality parameters was significantly affected by runoff rate.

The transport of DP, TP, NO3-N, NH4-N, TN, runoff, and soil erosion was reduced significantly on the plots with a grass hedge. Mean runoff rates on the hedge and no-hedge treatments were 17 and 29 mm, and erosion rates were 0.12 and 1.46 Mg ha -1 , respectively.

Grass hedges may reduce runoff losses of nutrients and sediment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of narrow switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) hedges (−0.75 m wide) on the transport of P and N from a field receiving beef cattle feedlot manure under tilled and no-till conditions. This study was conducted on a steep (12 % average slope) Monona silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls) soil near Treynor, Iowa. The experiment was a split-plot with no-till and disked systems as main plots and subplots of manure, fertilizer, and check with or without a grass hedge. A rainfall simulator was used and runoff was collected from both the initial and the following wet simulations. Only 38% of the no-till plots and 63% of disked plots had any runoff during the initial 6.4 cm hr−1 water application. A single narrow grass hedge reduced runoff concentrations of dissolved P (DP) by 47%, bioavailable P (BAP) by 48%, particulate P (PP) by 38%, total P (TP) by 40%, and NH4-N by 60% during the wet simulation on the no-till plots receiving manure, compared with similar plots with no hedges. The corresponding reductions in concentrations as a result of a grass hedge for DP, BAP, PP, TP, and NH4-N on the disked plots were 21, 29, 43, 38, and 52%, respectively. Runoff NH4-N concentration from fertilizer applied to the disked plots was reduced by 61%, NO3-N by 21%, and total N (TN) by 27% during the wet simulation when grass hedges were used. Grass hedges also reduced total quantities of DP, BAP, TP, and NH4-N during the wet simulation. The TP loss was 3.3% of applied P fertilizer and was 0.3% of applied manure P. Narrow grass hedges were effective in reducing P and N losses in runoff from both manure and fertilizer application.",0

The study area, which had slopes ranging from 8 to 16%, had produced corn for 33 years and the grass hedges had been established for six years. Simulated rainfall [64 mm hr−1 (2.5 in hr-1)I was applied for two hours to plots (3.7 m (12 ft) wide by 10.7 m (35.1 ft) long/with corn residue and to plots where corn residue was removed. The narrow grass hedges substantially reduced runoff and soil loss. Under no-till conditions, the plots with corn residue and pass hedges averaged 52% less runoff and 53% less soil loss tban similar plots without grass hakes. Under tilled conditions, the plots with corn residue and grass hedges averaged 22% less runoff and 57% Less soil loss than comparable plots without grass hedges. The plots with corn residue removed but with grass hedges present averaged 41 % less runoff and 63% less soil loss than similar plots without grass hedges. Narrow grass hedges are an effective conservation measure, especially when used in conjunction with such conservation practices as no-till or reduced-till firming systems.",1

The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of narrow grass hedges (NGHs) on reducing the transport of antimicrobials and ARGs in runoff after land application of swine manure slurry. Plot-scale rainfall simulation tests were conducted on 0.75 m by 4.0 m plots designed to test three treatment factors: manure amendment (control plots receiving no manure vs. amended plots receiving manure based on 3 times N requirement), NGH (plots with a NGH vs. plots without a NGH), and rainfall events (days 1-3). Runoff generated during three 30-min simulated rainfall events was sampled and analyzed for antimicrobials and ARGs. Manure amendment was responsible for the presence of antimicrobial tylosin ( < 0.0001) and tylosin resistance gene (B) ( < 0.0001) in runoff. Narrow grass hedges proved to be effective in reducing tylosin ( < 0.0001) and (B) ( < 0.0347) in runoff. Manure amendment was responsible for the introduction of tylosin ( < 0.0482) and (B) ( = 0.0128) into the soil; however, it had no significant impact on the abundance of the 16S rRNA gene in soil. Results from this study suggest that NGHs could be a best management practice to control the transport of antimicrobials and ARGs in agricultural runoff.",1

Reconversion of annual agricultural systems to perennial vegetation can lead to hydrologic function restoration, but its effect is still not well understood. Therefore, our objective was to assess the effects of strategic introduction of different amounts and location of native prairie vegetation (NPV) within agricultural landscapes on hydrological regulation. The study was conducted in Iowa (USA), and consisted of a fully balanced, replicated, incomplete block design whereby 12 zero-order ephemeral flow watersheds received four treatments consisting of varying proportions (0%, 10%, and 20%) of prairie vegetation located in different watershed positions (footslope vs. contour strips). Runoff volume and rate were measured from 2008 to 2010 (April– October) with an H-Flume installed in each catchment, and automated ISCO samplers. Over the entire study period, we observed a total of 129 runoff events with an average runoff volume reduction of 37% based on the three treatments with NPV compared to watersheds with row crops. We observed a progressively greater reduction across the 3 years of the study as the perennial strips became established with the greatest differences among treatments occurring in 2010. The differences among the watersheds were attributed mainly to NPV amount and position, with the 10% NPV at footslope treatment having the greatest runoff reduction probably because the portion of NPV filter strip that actually contacted watershed runoff was greater with the 10% NPV at footslope. We observed greater reductions in runoff in spring and fall likely because perennial prairie plants were active and crops were absent or not fully established. High antecedent soil moisture sometimes led to little benefit of the NPV treatments but in general the NPV treatments were effective during both small and large events. We conclude that, small amounts of NPV strategically incorporated into corn-soybean watersheds in the Midwest US can be used to effectively reduce runoff.",0

The use of flowering vegetation has been widely advocated as a strategy for providing parasitoids and predators with nectar and pollen. However, their herbivorous hosts and prey may exploit floral food sources as well. 2. Previous laboratory studies have shown that not all flower species are equally suitable in providing accessible nectar. Relatively little is known about actual nectar exploitation under field conditions. 3. The present study investigates nectar exploitation by the pest, Plutella xylostella, and its parasitoid, Diadegma semiclausum, under field conditions and examines whether floral nectar exploitation in the field can be predicted based on controlled laboratory studies. 4. Insects were collected from fields bordered by flowering margins containing Fagopyrum esculentum, Lobularia maritima, Anethum graveolens, Centaurea jacea or the grass Lolium perenne (control). Whole insect bodies were individually assayed by HPLC to establish their sugar profile as a measure of the level of energy reserves and the degree of food source use. 5. The average overall sugar content of P. xylostella and D. semiclausum collected in fields bordered by flowering margins was significantly higher than those of individuals collected from grass-bordered control plots. To the authors' knowledge, this represents the first demonstration that nectar-providing plants enhance the energetic state of herbivores under field conditions. 6. In contrast to earlier laboratory studies, the present study did not find elevated sugar contents in P. xylostella and D. semiclausum individuals collected from fields bordered by buckwheat (F. esculentum). 7. The present study shows widespread sugar feeding by both the herbivore and its parasitoid.

Eight habitats were studied in the farm: ponds, ditches, a riparian corridor, hedgerows, and four agricultural fields (mustard, oats, fallow, and legumes). The undisturbed riparian corridor had higher soil $${\text{NO}}_{\text{3}}^ - - {\text{N}}$$
 and $${\text{NH}}_4^ + - {\text{N}}$$
 concentrations, and potentially mineralizable N and higher abundances of bacterivore nematodes and longer food webs. Canonical correlation analysis showed associations between habitats and nematode trophic groups: predatory and bacterial-feeding nematodes in the riparian corridor and hedgerows, omnivore nematodes in the ponds and ditches, and fungal-feeding nematodes in the legume field. Soil chemical and physical properties mirrored the aboveground farm patterns and were more similar among habitats that were or had been cultivated, compared to the riparian corridor. Soil food web indices, based on functional analysis of nematode faunal composition, reflected the aboveground landscape heterogeneity. Discriminant analysis indicated that soil food web indices separated the two most disturbed habitats (ponds and tailwater ditches) from the two least disturbed habitats (the riparian corridor and hedgerows). The indices correlated with soil functioning as inferred by soil properties. Abundance of nematode taxa was not associated with aboveground landscape patterns. The complexity of the soil food web may have been influenced by (1) environmental factors that differed between years, (2) different time periods since disturbance in the various habitats, and (3) movement of nutrients and organisms by water flow between habitats in the farmscale.",0

When these systemic compounds are applied to seeds, low concentrations are subsequently found in the nectar and pollen of the crop, which are then collected and consumed by bees. Here we demonstrate that the current focus on exposure to pesticides via the crop overlooks an important factor: throughout spring and summer, mixtures of neonicotinoids are also found in the pollen and nectar of wildflowers growing in arable field margins, at concentrations that are sometimes even higher than those found in the crop. Indeed, the large majority (97%) of neonicotinoids brought back in pollen to honey bee hives in arable landscapes was from wildflowers, not crops. Both previous and ongoing field studies have been based on the premise that exposure to neonicotinoids would occur only during the blooming period of flowering crops and that it may be diluted by bees also foraging on untreated wildflowers. Here, we show that exposure is likely to be higher and more prolonged than currently recognized because of widespread contamination of wild plants growing near treated crops.",0

Introducing a sown wildflower component has the potential to increase dramatically the value of these buffer strips for a suite of native species, including butterflies. This study investigates management practices aiming to promote the establishment and maintenance of wildflowers in existing buffer strips. The effectiveness of two methods used to increase the establishment of wildflowers for the benefit of native butterfly species were tested, both individually and in combination. The management practices were: (1) the application of a selective graminicide (fluazifop-P-butyl) which reduces the dominance of competitive grasses; and (2) scarification of the soil which creates germination niches for sown wildflower seeds. A wildflower seed mix consisting of nine species was sown in conjunction with the scarification treatment. Responses of wildflowers and butterflies were monitored for two years after establishment. Results indicate that the combined scarification and graminicide treatment produced the greatest cover and species richness of sown wildflowers. Butterfly abundance, species richness and diversity were positively correlated with sown wildflower species richness, with the highest values in the combined scarification and graminicide treatment. These findings have confirmed the importance of both scarification as a means of introducing wildflower seed into existing buffer strips, and subsequent management using graminicides, for the benefit of butterflies. Application of this approach could provide tools to help butterfly conservation on farmland in the future.",0

Transport and fate of dissolved nitrous oxide (N2O) in groundwater and its significance to nitrogen dynamics within agro-ecosystems are poorly known in spite of significant potential of N2O to global warming and ozone depletion. Increasing denitrification in riparian buffers may trade a reduction in nitrate (NO3−) transport to surface waters for increased N2O emissions resulting from denitrification-produced N2O dissolved in groundwater being emitted into the air when groundwater flows into a stream or a river. This study quantifies the transport and fate of NO3− and dissolved N2O moving from crop fields through riparian buffers, assesses whether groundwater exported from crop fields and riparian buffers is a significant source of dissolved N2O emissions, and evaluates the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology to estimate dissolved N2O emission. We measured concentrations of NO3−; chloride (Cl−); pH; dissolved N2O, dissolved oxygen (DO), and organic carbon (DOC) in groundwater under a multi-species riparian buffer, a cool-season grass filter, and adjacent crop fields located in the Bear Creek watershed in central Iowa, USA. In both the multi-species riparian buffer and the cool-season grass filter, concentrations of dissolved N2O in the groundwater did not change as it passed through the sites, even when the concentrations of groundwater NO3− were decreased by 50% and 59%, respectively, over the same periods. The fraction of N lost to leaching and runoff (0.05) and the modified N2O emission factor, [ratio of dissolved N2O flux to N input (0.00002)] determined for the cropped fields indicate that the current IPCC methodology overestimates dissolved N2O flux in the sites. A low ratio between dissolved N2O flux and soil N2O emission (0.0003) was estimated in the cropped fields. These results suggest that the riparian buffers established adjacent to crop fields for water quality functions (enhanced denitrification) decreased NO3− and were not a source of dissolved N2O. Also, the flux of dissolved N2O from the cropped field was negligible in comparison to soil N2O emission in the crop fields.",0

This paper addresses these issues by using data collected from a detailed field experiment, carried out on two topographically different hillslopes (one steep and the other flat) located within an agricultural catchment in Western Australia. Continuous hydrometric data and measurements of chemical tracers, geochemical parameters, and NO3− concentrations taken from the shallow perched aquifer across riparian, midslope, and upland locations were analyzed and interpreted through a simple process-based numerical model of transport and reaction. The NO3− concentration data indicated that the temporal and spatial patterns of NO3− concentrations within the hillslopes are linked to the state of hydrological connectivity of the three landscape units as the shallow perched aquifer developed during the winter. Significant NO3− attenuation occurs within the riparian zones after the transport of NO3− from midslope sources begins. Application of a mixing model, which partitions the riparian zones into three water source components, and the numerical model of NO3− transport and reaction indicates that different mechanisms, dilution in the steep hillslope and denitrification in the flat hillslope, are responsible for much of the observed NO3− attenuation in the riparian zones. In this way, this work highlights the importance of hillslope topography in determining the relative roles of transport and reaction in NO3− attenuation and export from riparian zones. The experimental results also supported the use of the Damkohler number, a simple dimensionless number that is a measure of the competition between transport and reaction processes, which allowed a favorable comparison of our findings with previous results published in the literature for different geographical settings.",0

This study aims to analyse the spatial and seasonal influences of a hedgerow on nitrate dynamics in the soil and groundwater. Nitrate (NO3−) and chloride (Cl−) concentrations were measured with spatially dense sampling in the unsaturated soil and in the groundwater along a transect intersecting a bottomland oak (Quercus rubor) hedgerow after the growing season and during the dormant season. We explain NO3− dynamics by using Cl− as an index of tree-root extension and water transfer. At the end of the growing season, NO3− is entirely absorbed by the trees over a large and deep volume corresponding to the rooting zone, where, in contrast Cl− is highly concentrated due to root exclusion. However, these observed patterns in the soil have no influence on the deep groundwater composition at this season. During the dormant season, water transfer processes feeding the shallow groundwater layer are different upslope and downslope from the hedgerow in relation to the thickness of the unsaturated zone. Upslope, the shallow groundwater is fed by rainwater infiltration through the soil which favours Cl− dilution. Right under the hedge and downslope, the rapid ascent of the groundwater near the ground surface prevents rainwater input and Cl− dilution. Under the hedgerow the highest concentrations of Cl− coincide with the absence of NO3− in the shallow groundwater layer and with high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon. The absence of NO3− during the dormant season seems to be due to denitrification in the hedgerow rooting zone when it is rapidly saturated by groundwater. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0

Nitrate pathways in the upper 2 m of groundwater were investigated beneath wooded and grass-shrub riparian zones next to cultivated fields. Because trees can be important components of the overall nitrate pathway in wooded riparian zones, water sources used by riparian trees and possible effects of trees on nitrate concentrations in groundwater were also investigated. Average nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater beneath the cultivated fields were 5.5 mg/L upgradient of the wooded riparian zone and 3.5 mg/L upgradient of the grass-shrub zone. Shallow groundwater beneath the fields passed through the riparian zones and discharged into streams that had average nitrate concentrations of 8.5 mg/L (as N). Lateral variations of δD values in groundwater showed that mixing among different water sources occurred beneath the riparian zones. In the wooded riparian zone, nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater were diluted by upwelling, nitrate-poor, deep groundwater. Upwelling deep groundwater contained ammonium with a δ15N of 5‰ that upon nitrification and mixing with nitrate in shallow groundwater caused nitrate δ15N values in shallow groundwater to decrease by as much as 19.5‰. Stream water penetrated laterally beneath the wooded riparian zone as far as 19 m from the stream's edge and beneath the grass-shrub zone as far as 27 m from the stream's edge. Nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater immediately upgradient of where it mixed with stream water averaged 0.4 mg/L in the wooded riparian zone and 0.8 mg/L near the grass-shrub riparian zone. Nitrate concentrations increased toward the streams because of mixing with nitrate-rich stream water. Because nitrate concentrations were larger in stream water than shallow groundwater, concentrated nitrate in the streams cannot have come from shallow groundwater at these sites. Water sources of riparian trees were identified by comparing δD values of sap water, soil water, groundwater, and stream water. Soil water was the main water source for trees in the outer 4 to 6 m of one part of the wooded riparian zone and outer 10 m of another part. Groundwater was a significant water source for trees closer to the streams where the water table was less than about 2.1 to 2.7 m below the surface. No evidence was found in the nitrate concentration profiles that trees close to the streams that took up groundwater through their roots also took up nitrate from groundwater. The lack of such evidence is attributed to the nitrate concentration profiles being insufficiently sensitive indicators of nitrate removal by trees.",0

In study stretches where the stream channels were vegetated with thick mats of grass (Gly‐ceria fluitans), nitrate removal processes were particularly active. In such grassed stream channels, c. 75% of the nitrate removal was attributable to plant uptake and the remainder to denitrifica‐tion. Both of these nitrate removal processes were linearly dependent on nitrate concentration, resulting in an exponential decline of nitrate level from the springs along the stream's length. Regeneration of nitrogen, by plant decay within the stream channel, results in export of dissolved organic nitrogen and paniculate nitrogen from the catchments. The overall impact of vegetated stream channels in modifying nitrogen exports from catchments is discussed.",0

A buffer strip experiment consisting of two tree species (Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Casuarina cunninghamiana) with two planting densities and a pasture treatment was conducted to determine the effectiveness of NO3–N removal from a cattle feedlot effluent disposal area at Tullimba near Armidale, NSW Australia. Different management methods were applied for the buffers where grass and weeds were mowed 2–3 times during the second and third years and were not managed during the rest experimental years for the tree buffer, while grass was harvested 1–3 times per year for the pasture buffer. The differences between tree species and planting density significantly affected tree growth, but the growth difference did not significantly affect their capacities to reduce NO3–N in soil surface runoff and groundwater. On average for all the tree and pasture treatments, the buffer strips reduced NO3–N concentration by 8.5%, 14.7% and 14.4% for the surface runoff, shallow and deep groundwater respectively. The tree and pasture buffer strips were not significantly different in NO3–N reduction for both shallow and deep groundwater while the pasture buffer strips reduced significantly more NO3–N concentration in surface runoff than the tree buffer strips. Both buffer strips reduced more than 50% of surface runoff volume indicating that both the tree and pasture buffer strips were efficient at removing water and nutrients, mostly through a significant reduction in soil surface runoff volume.",1

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the presence and topographical position of PVS on soil and plant carbon (C) and N stocks relative to annual crop and native prairie vegetation. The study was implemented within three small adjacent watersheds, treated with one of the following cover types: (1) 100% row-crop agriculture (CROP); (2) 20% prairie vegetation (PVS) distributed along the contour across three topographical positions: upslope, sideslope and footslope position; and (3) 100% 17-year old reconstructed native prairie (RNP) as the control condition. Total soil organic C (SOC), total soil N (TN), inorganic N availability as indexed by ion exchange resins, N stocks in plant biomass and litter, and the ratio of C3:C4 plant species were measured during the 2010 growing season. Results showed that over five years of treatment, PVS footslope improved soil quality by increasing TN by almost 100% and SOC by 37%; while CROP footslope TN decreased by 31% and SOC decreased by 28%. Overall, N stocks in plant biomass and litter were higher in PVS compared with RNP, except in the footslope where the lower N plant stocks was associated with higher C3 abundance in RNP. Nitrogen availability was higher in CROP (25.4 ± 1.4), followed by PVS (10.2 ± 1.3), and RNP (2.2 ± 1.4); with the highest values recorded in the upslope position for PVS and RNP, and the footslope for CROP. These findings are important for designing watersheds with PVS to reduce N accumulation in the footslope position and promote additional N retention in soil organic",0

Hillslope plots receiving granular inorganic fertilizer, liquid cattle slurry and solid cattle manure (FYM) were compared using rainfall simulation for 4 storms on consecutive days at 22 mm h-1 and 35 minutes duration. The plots were hydrologically isolated in a randomized block layout of 4 treatments × 3 replicates and measured 30 × 5m; the upper 20m received either fertilizer, slurry or FYM, while the lower 10 m acted as an unfertilized grass buffer strip. Nitrogen and P export in surface runoff from grassland receiving inorganic fertilizer exceeded that from FYM or slurry treatments; concentrations up to46mgN1--1 and 15 mgP1–1 were recorded. Sixty eight % and 62% of the N from FYM and slurry respectively, was exported in organic form. Seventy four % (FYM) and 39% (slurry) of the P was in particulate or dissolved organic form. The buffer strip reduced N export in surface runoff by 94% and P export by 98% from inorganic fertilizer plots. A 75% reduction in N export was recorded from the buffer zone below slurry plots but only a 10% reduction in P, with most P remaining in the particulate or dissolved organic fraction. There was no significant difference in N export from the buffer zone between the inorganic fertilizer treatment and the untreated control.",0

The results of the analysis clearly show that nitrogen uptake is favourably affected by the windbreaks. Nitrogen uptake by the plants in the protected zone at Altona was 52% higher as compared to the unprotected zone. The plants at both the optimal protected and less protected areas at Newton absorbed similar amounts of nitrogen. The increased uptake of nitrogen in the protected zone at Altona was due to the windbreak which favourably influenced the temperature and the evapotranspiration rate. This resulted in the better growth and yield of plants.,0

This study monitored (December 2009-May 2011) NO fluxes at two agricultural riparian buffers in the White River watershed in Indiana to assess the impact of land use and hydrogeomorphologic (HGM) attributes on emission. The study sites included a riparian forest in a glacial outwash/alluvium setting (White River [WR]) and a grassed riparian buffer in tile-drained till plains (Leary Weber Ditch [LWD]). Adjacent corn ( L.) fields were monitored for land use assessment. Analysis of variance identified season, land use (riparian buffer vs. crop field), and site geomorphology as major drivers of NO fluxes. Strong relationships between N mineralization and NO fluxes were found at both sites, but relationships with other nutrient cycling indicators (C/N ratio, dissolved organic C, microbial biomass C) were detected only at LWD. Nitrous oxide emission showed strong seasonal variability; the largest NO peaks occurred in late spring/early summer as a result of flooding at the WR riparian buffer (up to 27.8 mg NO-N m d) and N fertilizer application to crop fields. Annual NO emission (kg NO-N ha) was higher in the crop fields (WR: 7.82; LWD: 6.37) than in the riparian areas. A significant difference ( < 0.02) in annual NO emission between the riparian buffers was detected (4.32 vs. 1.03 kg NO-N ha at WR and LWD, respectively), and this difference was attributed to site geomorphology and flooding (WR is flood prone; no flooding occurred at tile-drained LWD). The study results demonstrate the significance of landscape geomorphology and land-stream connection (i.e., flood potential) as drivers of NO emission in riparian buffers and therefore argue that an HGM-based approach should be especially suitable for determination of regional NO budget in riparian ecosystems.",0

Denitrification within riparian buffers may trade reduced nonpoint source pollution of surface waters for increased greenhouse gas emissions resulting from denitrification-produced nitrous oxide (N2O). However, little is known about the N2O emission within conservation buffers established for water quality improvement or of the importance of short-term N2O peak emission following rewetting dry soils and thawing frozen soils. Such estimates are important in reducing uncertainties in current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodologies estimating soil N2O emission which are based on N inputs. This study contrasts N2O emission from riparian buffer systems of three perennial vegetation types and an adjacent crop field, and compares measured N2O emission with estimates based on the IPCC methodology. We measured soil properties, N inputs, weather conditions and N2O fluxes from soils in forested riparian buffers, warm-season and cool-season grass filters, and a crop field located in the Bear Creek watershed in central Iowa, USA. Cumulative N2O emissions from soils in all riparian buffers (5.8 kg N2O-N ha−1 in 2006–2007) were significantly less than those from crop field soils (24.0 kg N2O-N ha−1 in 2006–2007), with no difference among the buffer vegetation types. While N2O peak emissions (up to 70-fold increase) following the rewetting of dry soils and thawing of frozen soils comprised 46–70% of the annual N2O emissions from soils in the crop field, soils in the riparian buffers were less sensitive to such events (3 to 10-fold increase). The ratio of N2O emission to N inputs within riparian buffers (0.02) was smaller than those of crop field (0.07). These results indicate that N2O emission from soils within the riparian buffers established for water quality improvement should not be considered a major source of N2O emission compared to crop field emission. The observed large difference between measured N2O emissions and those estimated using the IPCC's recommended methodology (i.e., 87% underestimation) in the crop field suggests that the IPCC methodology may underestimate N2O emission in the regions where soil rewetting and thawing are common, and that conditions predicted by future climate-change scenarios may increase N2O emissions.",0

Typically, such strips are floristically species poor and are dominated by grasses. In the present study, we developed management practices to enhance the floristic and structural diversity of these existing strips for the benefit of spiders, a key provider of natural pest control in crops.


Across three UK arable farms, we investigated the benefits of: (i) scarification to create germination niches into which wildflower seeds were sown and (ii) the effect of graminicide applications to suppress grass dominance. Spiders were sampled twice per year (July and September) during 2008 and 2009.


The combination of scarification with wildflower seeds, as well as graminicide, resulted in the greatest wildflower cover and lowest grass cover, with a general trend of increased abundance of adult and juvenile spiders. The abundance of Pachygnatha degeeri, Bathyphantes gracilis and juvenile wolf spiders of the genus Pardosa was positively correlated with wildflower cover, probably reflecting increased prey availability. Sward structure was negatively correlated with Erigone atra, Oedothorax fuscus and juvenile Pardosa abundance.


Management that utilizes existing commonly adopted agri-environment options, such as grass buffer strips, represents a potentially important conservation tool for increasing the quantity and quality of invertebrate habitats. This can maximize opportunities for the provision of multiple ecosystem services, including pest regulation by predators such as spiders. These management practices have the potential to be incorporated into existing U.K. and European agri-environment schemes.",0

One method of reducing excess nutrient runoff from non-point sources is to restore or enhance existing riparian areas as vegetative buffers. A field scale study was conducted to assess the ability of remnant giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea (Walt.) Muhl.) and forest riparian buffer zones to attenuate nutrients in agricultural surface runoff from natural precipitation events. Two adjacent, 10.0 m wide riparian buffers were instrumented with 16 overland flow collectors to monitor surface runoff for nitrate, ammonium, and orthophosphate. Measurements were taken at 3.3 m increments within each buffer. The forest buffer significantly reduced incoming dissolved nitrate-N, dissolved ammonium-N, total ammonium-N, and total orthophosphate masses in surface runoff by 97, 74, 68, and 78 , respectively within the 10.0 m riparian buffer. Nutrient reductions within the cane buffer were 100 for all three nutrients due to relatively high infiltration rates. Significant reductions of total ammonium- N and total orthophosphate were detected by 3.3 m in the cane buffer and at 6.6 m in the forest buffer. Results suggest that both giant cane and forest vegetation are good candidates to incorporate into riparian buffer restoration designs for southern Illinois as well as in other regions within their native range with similar climatic and physiographic conditions.",0

During the study period (March 1981 to March 1982), dramatic changes in water-borne nutrient loads occurred in the riparian forest of the watershed. From surface runoff waters that had transited : 50 m of riparian forest, an estimated 4.1 Mg of particulates, 1I kg of particulate organic-N, 0.83 kg of ammonium-N, 2.7 kg of nitrate-N and 3.0 kg of total particulate-P per ha of riparian forest were removed during the study year. In addition, an estimated removal of 45 kg ha- yr-t of nitrate- N occurred in subsurface flow as it moved through the riparian zone. Nutrient uptake rates for the cropland and riparian forest were estimated. These systems were then compared with respect to their pathways of nutrient flow and ability to retain nutrients. The cropland appeared to retain fewer nutrients than the riparian forest and is thought to incur the majority of its nutrient losses in harvested crop. The dominant pathway of total-N loss from the riparian forest seemed to be subsurface flux. Total phosphorus loss from the riparian forest appeared almost evenly divided between surface and subsurface losses. Nutrient removals in the riparian forest are thought to be of ecological significance to receiving waters and indicate that coupling natural systems and managed habitats within a watershed may reduce diffuse-source pollution.",1

The widths of riparian forest buffer strip are at least 50 meters in these two case study sites. The composition, spatial variability and seasonal changes of cations and anions in soil solution collecting from orchard, interface and riparian buffer zones were analyzed to control the water quality in two water reservoirs. The results indicated that the soil nutrients in the orchard near Techi reservoir, especially for the ions of phosphate, K, Ca, Mg, and ammonium-N, can be significantly intercepted by a forest buffer strip within 30 meters. Owing to no any application of chemical fertilizers in the orchard near Feitsui reservoir since 1987, the nutrient concentration of different ions in soil solution is very low. This low concentration of ions in soil solution released from orchard region near Feitsui reservoir can be intercepted in the interface area between the orchard region and forest buffer strip. The results also indicate that the width of riparian buffer strip needs at least 10 meters to intercept the soluble nutrients under this very low input of chemical fertilizers. We make sure that enough width, at least 30 meters of riparian buffer strips for these two case studies, can be regarded as a nutrient sink to intercept the soil nutrients soluble from orchard region and keep good water quality in the reservoirs.",0

Warm-season perennial grasses may be useful in filter strips to trap manure nutrients and as biomass feedstock for nutrient removal. We explored the use of 'Alamo' switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) in a biomass production-filter strip system treated with dairy manure. We measured changes in extractable P in the soil, NO3 -N in soil water, and changes in total reactive P and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of runoff water before and after a switchgrass filter strip. Five rates of dairy manure (target rates of 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg N ha(-1) from solid manure in 1995; 0, 75, 150, 300, and 600 kg N ha(-1) from lagoon effluent in 1996 and 1997) were surface-applied to field plots of switchgrass (5.2 by 16.4 m) with a 5.2- by 16.4-m switchgrass filter strip below the manured area. Yield of switchgrass from the manured area increased linearly with increasing manure rate in each year. Soil water samples collected at 46 or 91 cm below the soil surface on 30 dates indicated < 3 mg L(-1) of NO3-N in all plots. Concentrations of total reactive P in surface runoff water were reduced an average of 47% for the 150 kg N rate and 76% for the 600 kg N rate in 1996 and 1997 after passing through the strip. Manure could effectively substitute for inorganic fertilizer in switchgrass biomass production with dual use of the switchgrass as a vegetative filter strip.",1

Four treatments with PFS of different spatial coverage and distribution (No-PFS, 10% PFS, 10% PFS with strips, and 20% PFS with strips) were arranged in a balanced incomplete block design across four blocks in 2007. A no-tillage two-year corn (Zea mays L.) –soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) rotation was grown in row-cropped areas beginning in 2007. Runoff was monitored by H flumes, and runoff water samples were collected during the growing seasons to determine concentrations of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) through 2011. Overall, the presence of PFS reduced mean annual NO3-N, TN, and TP concentrations by 35%, 73%, and 82%, respectively, and reduced annual NO3-N, TN, and TP losses by 67%, 84%, and 90%, respectively. However, the amount and distribution of PFS had no significant impact on runoff and nutrient yields. The findings suggest that utilization of PFS at the footslope position of annual row crop systems provides an effective approach to reducing nutrient loss in runoff from small agricultural watersheds.",0

No-till farming systems are well known agricultural practices and are widely used in temperate areas. In that regard, different settings and widths of riparian buffer zones (12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 m) with woody vegetation, shrubs or grasses were assessed. The methodology was comprised of the evaluation of a large number of experimental sites and the sampling was conducted after the first rain period and respective fertilizer applications. The results point to the fact that effectiveness is largely controlled by buffer zone width and vegetation type. Indeed, buffer zones with 60 m width composed of woody soils were more effective in phosphorus (99.9%) and nitrogen (99.9%) removal when compared to shrub (66.4% and 83.9%, respectively) or grass vegetation (52.9% and 61.6%, respectively) areas.

Spring barley or oats were grown on the field in 1991–2002 and dairy cows grazed on the grassed field and grazed grass buffer strips (gGBS) in 2003–2005. Buffer strips decreased losses of sediment, total P and total N by 60, 40 and 40–60% in surface run-off from a cropped field. However, the loss of PO4-P was 70% higher from the field with the non-harvested VBS than from the field without buffers (NBS). On the pasture, erosion and N losses were quite low, whereas PO4-P losses from all treatments were rather high. The high loss of PO4-P from the VBS and pasture was most likely due to PO4-P leaching from the soil surface and decaying grass residue in spring.",0

A nitrate plume in shallow ground water with concentrations exceeding 10 mg NO3-N L(-1) moved into the restored forested riparian wetland. Along most of the plume front, concentrations were less than 4 mg NO3-N L(-1) within 25 m. Two preferential flow paths associated with past hydrologic modifications to the site allowed the nitrate plume to progress further into the restored forested riparian wetland. Surface runoff total N, dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), and total P concentrations averaged 8.63 mg N L(-1), 1.37 mg P L(-1), and 1.48 mg P L(-1), respectively, at the field edge and were reduced to 4.18 mg N L(-1), 0.31 mg P L(-1), and 0.36 mg P L(-1), respectively, at the restored forested riparian wetland outlet. Water and nutrient mass balance showed that retention and removal rates for nitrogen species ranged from a high of 78% for nitrate to a low of 52% for ammonium. Retention rates for both DRP and total P were 66%. Most of the N retention and removal was accounted for by denitrification.

This study investigated soil properties (bulk density, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) in different land use types (small scale agriculture in recent settlements, mixed agriculture in established peri-urban settlements, large- scale commercial agriculture, and the gazetted forest reference condition) and their adjacent buffer strips. Bulk density, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus within 30-m riparian buffer strips adjacent to recent settlement landuseareasweresimilar tothoseofthegazettedforest reference condition, but only bulk density of the buffer strips adjacent to peri-urban and commercial agriculture land use areas were similar to the gazetted forest reference condition. Phosphorus is a sensitive indicator of the impacts of human activity, as increased concen- trations were observed with increasing scale of land use activity. For riparian buffers adjacent to recent settle- ments, soil phosphorus was significantly higher in buffers narrower than 30 m (5.01 mg P kg −1 )t han gazetted forest (3.40 mg P kg −1 )b ut not significantly different for riparian buffers wider than 30 m (3.81 mg P kg −1 ) compared to gazetted forest. Based on the research, it is recommended that policies governing riparian buffer strips become (1) stricter, with the current ""maximum"" of 30 m considered a minimum; and (2) adaptive, with 30 m used in small- scale agricultural areas, and wider riparian buffer strips used in medium- and large-scale agricultural areas.",0

Steinernematids were recovered from 48 % of the sites but only one site yielded Heterorhabditis sp. The species recovered most frequently was Steinernema bibionis (Bovien). Another unidentified Steinernema sp. was also isolated. Prevalence of steinernematids in the different types of habitat formed continuum so that roadside verges harboured them most often while heathland sites yielded them least often. Mean soil temperatures at 5 cm were about 15 °C in fields and verges, 13 °C in hedgerows and heathland and 12 °C in woodland. Prevalence of the nematodes varied in different parts of Britain and was influenced by soil type. They were associated with calcareous soils, especially those with a calcareous subsoil horizon. Soils which are periodically or seasonally water-logged were suitable. Soils enriched by humus and hence high in organic matter frequently harboured the nematodes and some suitable soils had significant clay contents or subsoils high in clay. It appears that the two steinernematids are relatively unspecialized species, occurring in diverse habitats and soil types and are adapted to cooler temperatures.",0

Particle and odorous compound concentrations were monitored before and after the VEB. Wind tunnel experiments indicated that building orientation had about the same impact on air flow patterns as the combined buildings and VEB. Field monitoring studies revealed that air flow patterns at a swine facility were dynamic showing intense instability during the heat of the day, but stable air in the evening hours indicating that air during the day was controlled by vertical movement into the atmosphere while in the evening air patterns show a collapse mostly horizontal movement. Total particle counts before and after the vegetative buffer were reduced by over 40% and odorous compound concentrations for volatile fatty acids, phenol and indole compounds were reduced by 40–60%. Plant material taken from trees in the vegetative buffer showed no significant loading gradients between materials facing the swine facility and those opposite the swine facility.

The main aim of the study was to test whether organic farming enhances local plant species richness in both crop and non-crop areas of vineyard farms located in intensive conventional landscapes. Nine conventional and nine organic farms were selected in an intensively cultivated region (i.e. no gradient in landscape composition) in northern Italy. In each farm, vascular plants were sampled in one vineyard and in two non-crop linear habitats, grass strips and hedgerows, adjacent to vineyards and therefore potentially influenced by farming. We used linear mixed models to test the effect of farming, and species longevity (annual vs. perennial) separately for the three habitat types. In our intensive agricultural landscapes organic farming promoted local plant species richness in vineyard fields, and grassland strips while we found no effect for linear hedgerows. Differences in species richness were not associated to differences in species composition, indicating that similar plant communities were hosted in vineyard farms independently of the management type. This negative effect of conventional farming was probably due to the use of herbicides, while mechanical operations and mowing regime did not differ between organic and conventional farms. In grassland strips, and only marginally in vineyards, we found that the positive effect of organic farming was more pronounced for perennial than annual species.",1

The current investigation assessed the use of the beneficial ascomycete Trichoderma asperellum (Samuels, Lieckf & Nirenberg) and a trap crop of Brassica rapa L. turnip rape cv. “Brachina,” both with and without an application of slurry fertilizer, for pest suppression and yield enhancement of winter oilseed rape cv. “Californium.” The presence of the trap crop significantly increased 1000 grain weight but not total yield or lipid content of the oilseed rape because turnip rape was not attractive enough to prevent colonization of the principal crop. Increase in 1000 grain weight, lipid content, and total seed yield were found in oilseed rape sprayed with three applications of T. asperellum, but the ascomycete had no influence on the insect pests observed.

Species richness of Orthoptera was significantly higher on headland footpaths (6 species) than on crossfield rights of way (3 species), suggesting that footpaths along the edges of fields may provide refuges in arable farmland. It seems that the absence of regular ploughing on the headland footpaths may be beneficial to mesophilous grasshopper species, the crossfield footpaths constituting too much of an ephemeral habitat (due to annual ploughing and cropping) to support the full range of species.

However, traditional fallow field borders lack sufficient pollen and nectar sources required to sustain beneficial insect populations; therefore, borders planted to a mix of native prairie flowers and grasses may be needed if increases in beneficial insect populations are desired. Although the value of fallow borders to birds has been established, little is known about bird use of beneficial insect habitats. Using single-observer transect surveys, we compared overwintering sparrow densities among 4 field border treatments (planted native warm season grasses and prairie flowers, planted prairie flowers only, fallow, and mowed) replicated around 9 organic crop fields from November to March 2009-2010 and 2010-2011. Sparrow densities were 5-10 times lower in mowed borders than in other border treatments in 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, but did not differ among planted and fallow borders in either year.

The cultural dimensions of hedgerows and their implications for future hedged landscapes were investigated through the collection and exploration of different groups perspectives - public, farmers and experts - in England and Canada, using a diversity of primary and secondary data sources.

English hedgerows were important to all groups. Everyone liked hedged landscapes for aesthetic, visual and wildlife reasons. They were important for the way they break up the landscape; provide signs of the changing seasons; their sense of mystery and intimacy; their connections with the past and childhood memories. They are also seen as part of England’s history and national identity. Such cultural identity was absent in the Canadian data. 

However, some groups also held a rational or objective view which was dominant over this subjective or emotional view and which affects where they draw the boundaries to their systems of interest. Farmers were most concerned with their farms (and the hedgerows they owned) as a business, while experts dealt mainly with the ecological aspects of hedgerows.

There was found to be little awareness of others groups views with different groups seeing the same action in very different ways. Even where there was contact between farmers and experts, there could be a lack of trust. 

Finally, it is noted that policy and practice towards hedgerows have ignored many of these relationships and that the approach used here offers opportunities to examine the different systems of interest.",0

The distribution of shelter to leeward of a windbreak of tall trees was compared with the pattern of distribution of insects above and within a wheat crop.



The pattern for flying insects blown from elsewhere resembled the shelter profile, in contrast to insects originating in the windbreak, which accumulated immediately behind the trees, and those originating a few metres to windward, which accumulated in a zone between 1/2 and 1 H (10–20 m) to leeward. These patterns were more distinct in direct than in oblique incident winds.



The pattern of infestation of a breeding population of cereal thrips in the wheat resembled the distribution of airborne primary migrants 1–2 months earlier; the pattern of scatophagid flies on the crop also resembled that of airborne populations of other dung feeders originating slightly to windward of the trees.",0

This paper presents results from hydrometric monitoring of riparian buffer hydrology in a pasture catchment. Runoff processes and riparian flowpaths were investigated on two planar hillslopes with regenerating grass and E. globulus buffers. Surface runoff and subsurface flows (A- and B-horizons) were measured for 3 years using surface runoff collectors, subsurface troughs and piezometers. Water volumes moving through the riparian buffers via the measured flowpaths were ranked B-horizon ≫ surface runoff ≈ A-horizon. Runoff volumes through the B-horizon troughs were an order of magnitude greater than those recorded for the most productive surface runoff plots or the A-horizon troughs. Subsurface runoff and saturation-excess overland flow (SOF) were limited to the winter months, whereas infiltration-excess overland flow (IEOF) can occur all year round during intense storms. Surface runoff was recorded on 33 occasions, mostly during winter (late May–early October), and total annual surface runoff volumes collected by the 20 unconfined (2 m wide) runoff plots varied between > 80 and < 20 m3. Subsurface flow only occurred in winter, and the 6 m wide B-horizon subsurface troughs flowed above 1 l s−1 continuously, whereas the A-horizon troughs flowed infrequently (<6 days per year). In summer, surface runoff occurred as IEOF during intense storms in the E. globulus buffer, but not in the grass buffer. Observations suggest that surface crusting reduced the soil's infiltration capacity in the E. globulus buffer. During winter, SOF and seepage were observed in both buffers, but subsurface flow through the B-horizon was the dominant flowpath. Key hydrologic differences between the grass and tree buffers are the generation of IEOF in the E. globulus buffer during intense summer storms, and the smaller subsurface runoff volumes and fewer flow days in the E. globulus buffer. Low surface runoff volumes are likely to limit the potential of these buffers to filter pollutants from surface runoff. High subsurface flow volumes and saturated conductivities are also likely to limit the residence time of water in the subsurface domain. Based on their hydrologic performance, the key roles of riparian buffers in this landscape are likely to be displacing sediment and nutrient-generating activities away from streams and stabilizing channel morphology.

The total dry weight biomass peaked in early August at 2,130–2,360 and 5,500–6,270 kg ha−1 for the grazed and the other BZs, respectively. In August, 3,840–4,830 kg ha−1 were removed from the harvested BZs while the entire biomass of the non-harvested BZs remained in the field. In October, total P and N contents varied from 2.4–10.2 to 19–72 kg ha−1, respectively, the lowest amounts being for the young harvested BZ and the highest for the non-harvested BZs. A considerable decrease of P and N contents occurred in the biomass up to 6.1 and almost 30 kg ha−1, respectively, after the first frosts. Harvesting of BZs is recommended to decrease the amount of P and N in the BZs and reduce the risk of P and N leaching outside the growing season.",1

Vegetation within the flowpath increases water infiltration and decreases water turbulence, thus enhancing pollutant removal by sedimentation within filter media and infiltration through the filter surface. Field experiments have been conducted to examine the efficiency of vegetated filter strips for phosphorus removal from cropland runoff with 20 filters with varying length (2 to 15 m), slope (2.3 and 5%), and vegetated cover, including bare-soil plots as control. Artificial runoff used in this study had an average phosphorus concentration of 2.37 mg L(-1) and a sediment concentration of 2700 mg L(-1). The average phosphorus trapping efficiency of all vegetated filters was 61% and ranged from 31% in a 2-m filter to 89% in a 15-m filter. Filter length has been found to be the predominant factor affecting P trapping in VFS. The rate of inflow, type of vegetation, and density of vegetation coverage had secondary influences on P removal. Short filters (2 and 5 m), which are somewhat effective in sediment removal, are much less effective in P removal. Increasing the filter length beyond 15 m is ineffective in enhancing sediment removal but is expected to further enhance P removal. Sediment deposition, infiltration, and plant adsorption are the primary mechanisms for phosphorus trapping in VFS.",1

The objective of this 4-year study was to evaluate changes in the biomass and P content of the roots and shoots of plants growing in a multi-species versus a single species riparian buffer as an index of P capture potential. Periodic harvests of above ground vegetation were combined with root cores to estimate the total standing biomass and the pool of P in plant tissue in three vegetative cover types dominated by either switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), an alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-smooth bromegrass (Bromis inermis Leyss) mix, or a fast growing superior cottonwood (Populus deltoids Bartr., clone 42-7). An existing stand of smooth brome served as the single species control. Standing biomass increased in all three cover types during the 4 years of study, with the greatest increases observed in the cottonwood (2345 g m−2) and switchgrass (1818 g m−2). Biomass production in the smooth brome control did not change during the study period. Based on the 4th-year samples, standing pools of P closely paralleled total plant biomass and root surface area with cottonwood accumulating the greatest amount of P at 19.4 g m−2 compared to 4.3 g m−2 for the smooth brome control. Estimates of potential P export via biomass harvest from a mixed buffer over a 4-year interval were 101 kg ha−1 compared to 62 kg ha−1 for the smooth brome control; a 63% increase in export capacity due largely to the inclusion of cottonwood. Addition of a fast growing woody species combined with periodic biomass harvests has the potential to reduce P movement to surface waters.",0

These properties are prone to changes caused by natural forces and human activity. The hydraulic properties of the surface soil greatly impact the generation of surface runoff and accompanied erosion, the major concern of agricultural water protection.

The general target of this thesis was to improve our understanding of the structural and hydraulic properties of boreal clay soils. Physical properties of a clayey surface soil (0–10 cm, clay content 51%), with a micaceous/illitic mineralogy subjected to three different management practices of perennial vegetation, were studied. Tee study sites were vegetated buffer zones located side by side in SW Finland: 1) natural vegetation with no management, 2) harvested once a year, and 3) grazed by cattle. The soil structure, hydraulic properties, shrinkage properties and soil water repellency were determined at all sites.

Two distinct flow domains were evident. The surface soil was characterized by subangular blocky, angular blocky and platy aggregates. Hence, large, partially accommodated, irregular elongated pores dominated the macropore domain at all sites. The intra-aggregate pore system was mostly comprised of pores smaller than 30 µm, which are responsible for water storage. Macropores at the grazed site, compacted by hoof pressure, were horizontally oriented and pore connectivity was poorest, which decreased water and air flux compared with other sites.

Drying of the soil greatly altered its structure. The decrease in soil volume between wet and dry soil was 7–10%, most of which occurred in the moisture range of field conditions. Structural changes, including irreversible collapse of interaggregate pores, began at matric potentials around -6 kPa indicating, instability of soil structure against increasing hydraulic stress. Water saturation and several freezethaw cycles between autumn and spring likely weakened the soil structure.

Soil water repellency was observed at all sites at the time of sampling and when soil was dryer than about 40 vol.%. (matric potential < -6 kPa).Therefore, water repellency contributes to water ?ow over a wide moisture range. Water repellency was also observed in soils with low organic carbon content (< 2%), which suggests that this phenomenon is common in agricultural soils of Finland due to their relatively high organic carbon content.

Aggregate-related pedofeatures of dense infillings described as clay intrusions were found at all sites. The formation of these intrusions was attributed to clay dispersion and/or translocation during spring thaw and drying of the suspension in situ. These processes generate very new aggregates whose physical properties are most probably different from those of the bulk soil aggregates. Formation of the clay infillings suggested that prolonged wetness in autumn and spring impairs soil structure due to clay dispersion, while on the other hand it contributes to the pedogenesis of the soil.

The results emphasize the dynamic nature of the physical properties of clay soils, essentially driven by their moisture state. In a dry soil, fast preferential flow is favoured by abundant macropores including shrinkage cracks and is further enhanced by water repellency. Increase in soil moisture reduces water repellency, and swelling of accommodated pores lowers the saturated hydraulic conductivity. Moisture- and temperature-related processes significantly alter soil structure over a time span of 1 yr. Thus, the pore characteristics as well as the hydraulic properties of soil are time-dependent.",0

Buffer zones are wide field boundaries established to prevent nutrient leaching and erosion into waterways and serve as habitats for farmland wildlife. Our main hypothesis was that several years of grazing or cutting management results in greater plant species richness and heterogeneity in buffer zones in comparison with sites managed for only a few years. We also hypothesized that litter cover and soil phosphorus (P) level would decrease after several years of management, in comparison sites with relatively few years of management. Through this study we aimed to gain a better understanding of how to increase biodiversity in buffer zones. The study included 15 buffer zones within a single landscape. Mean species richness was significantly higher in the group of sites grazed over several years (21 species) in contrast to extensively cut sites (14.8 species) and/or grazed sites (18 species). Species heterogeneity did not respond to different management regimes. Management, slope aspect and litter were significant explanatory factors for species composition. The amount of soil phosphorus measured at three different depths was significantly lower in the buffer zones managed by cutting or grazing for a few years in contrast to those that were grazed for several years. Management that positively affected species diversity did not result in the expected decrease in soil phosphorus. Therefore, we propose that the greater species richness at grazed sites results mainly from disturbances caused by grazing.",0

Young and old, sown and naturally developed field margin strips were compared and differences to large fallows established. The five types of field margin strips (around cereal fields) were: (1, 2) 1- or 6-year-old naturally developed strips, (3) strips sown with a Phacelia mixture, (4) strips sown with a mixture of 19 wild flower species, and (5) strips sown with winter wheat or oat as a control. The naturally developed vegetation of the field margin strips was dominated by aggressive weeds, presumably due to the intensive farming practices and the fertile soils. Cirsium arvense populations decreased, while Elymus repens populations increased with age of habitat. Sowings were suitable to suppress these aggressive weeds. Potted plants of mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) and red clover (Trifolium pratense) were exposed in the field margin strips to study arthropod colonization of these experimentally standardized plant patches. Arthropod species richness did not differ between field margin types, reflecting the overall similarity in floristic diversity, but sprayed and strip-free edges of cereal fields had a reduced diversity. Dispersal of insect populations of red clover into the cereal fields decreased with increasing distance, but benefited from adjacent field margin strips. Populations of predators (mainly spiders) as well as predator-prey ratios were significantly larger in 6-year-old than in 1-year-old strips emphasizing the importance of habitat age for natural enemies and possible biological control. Predator-prey ratios were also higher on old than young fallows. Large fallows had greater predator-prey ratios than small field margin strips emphasizing the trophic-level hypothesis of island biogeography in that the relative importance of natural enemies increased with habitat area. Insect species richness was only marginally influenced by area and not by age. As species richness of predators did not increase with area and age, species diversity and the possible biological-control function did not covary.",1

In New Zealand the widespread conversion of forest to agricultural land has caused degradation of streams and riparian ecosystems. We assessed nine riparian buffer zone schemes in North Island, New Zealand that had been fenced and planted (age range from 2 to 24 years) and compared them with unbuffered control reaches upstream or nearby. Macroinvertebrate community composition was our prime indicator of water and habitat quality and ecological functioning, but we also assessed a range of physical and water quality variables within the stream and in the riparian zone. Generally, streams within buffer zones showed rapid improvements in visual water clarity and channel stability, but nutrient and fecal contamination responses were variable. Significant changes in macroinvertebrate communities toward “clean water” or native forest communities did not occur at most of the study sites. Improvement in invertebrate communities appeared to be most strongly linked to decreases in water temperature, suggesting that restoration of in-stream communities would only be achieved after canopy closure, with long buffer lengths, and protection of headwater tributaries. Expectations of riparian restoration efforts should be tempered by (1) time scales and (2) spatial arrangement of planted reaches, either within a catchment or with consideration of their proximity to source areas of recolonists.",0

Proximity of a hedgerow had a major impact upon population dynamics, with more species and a greater over all abundance near field edges. It was the major factor governing the abundance of Isotomurus palustris and Bourletiella hortensis, whereas crop type was most important in determining numbers of Jeannenotia stachi, Sminthurus viridis, Sminthurinus elegans and Lepidocyrus spp. Temporal variation in species abundance was also clear: abundances of J. stachi, B. hortensis, I. palustris and Lepidocyrtus spp. decreased through the sampling period while those of S. viridis and Isotoma viridis increased.

However, such strips do not intercept all contaminants, particularly soluble ones. Although preferential flow (PF) has been suggested as one factor among several decreasing the efficiency of buffer strips, the mechanisms involved are not well understood. This project examines buffer strip efficiency at intercepting solutes when subsurface PF occurs. Two soluble sorbed tracers, FD&C Blue #1 and rhodamine WT, were applied on an agricultural sandy loam soil to evaluate the ability of a naturally vegetated buffer strip to intercept soluble contaminants. Rhodamine was applied about 15 m from the creek, while the Blue was applied 15 m to 165 m from the creek. Tracer concentration was measured over a two-year period in both the creek and the buffer strip through soil and water samples. Although the tracers traveled via different pathways, they both quickly moved toward the creek, passing beneath the buffer strip through the soil matrix. Our results demonstrate that the risk of water contamination by soluble contaminants is high in such systems, even when a well-vegetated buffer strip is used. The design of buffer strips should be modified to account for underground bypass, either by using plants that have deep, fine roots that do not favour PF or by adding a filter extending deep underground that can be regularly changed.",0

Significantly more pseudoscorpions were found in old compared to new margins, suggesting they may be attracted to litter build-up over time. Pseudo- scorpion numbers were reduced on treatments subjected to two cuts annually, particularly when a summer cut was included, although this effect was ameliorated when the cuttings were left. However, pseudo- scorpions were most numerous on treatments which involved no management because of the increase in leaf litter which may replicate a woodland environment. Adjacent hedges appear to buffer the effects of management: margins with adjacent hedges (rather than ditches or tracks) having more individuals. In contrast to results for other invertebrate groups, sowing wildflower seed did not significantly increase the abundance of pseudoscorpions. The effect of different treatments on pseudoscorpion numbers demonstrates that they are useful indicators of the effects of management practice.",0

The bufferstrip was a 3.5 m wide unfertilised grass strip adjacent to a ditch on an arable field. In total 24 groundwater wells were installed in 4 transects perpendicular to the ditch to determine Cl, NO3 and δ15N concentrations. Piezometers were installed to assess the groundwater flow, which was in the direction of the ditch with small downward leakage across a peat layer at about 3 m depth. Nitrogen was dominantly present as nitrate (NO3). The NO3-N concentrations under the bufferstrip were significantly lower than under the adjacent arable field. The lower concentrations were due to dilution, uptake by grass and denitrification. Nitrate was actively removed in the bufferstrip, since the Cl/NO3 ratios were higher in the bufferstrip than in the remainder of the field. Furthermore, δ15N data indicated that denitrification occurred in the groundwater and increased with decreasing distance to the ditch. NO3-N loads to the ditch were estimated at 8.5 kg ha−1yr−1, which is relatively low for this area. We can, however, not determine whether these relatively low NO3-N loads were causally related to the reduced NO3-N concentrations in the bufferstrip.

However, the effect of VBS designs and species composition on reducing herbicide and veterinary antibiotic transport has not been well documented. An experiment consisting of three VBS designs and one continuous cultivated fallow control replicated in triplicate was conducted to assess effectiveness in reducing herbicide and antibiotic transport for claypan soils. The three VBS designs include (i) tall fescue, (ii) tall fescue with a switchgrass hedge barrier, and (iii) native vegetation (largely eastern gamagrass). Rainfall simulation was used to create uniform antecedent soil moisture content in the plots and to generate runoff. Our results suggested that all VBS significantly reduced the transport of dissolved and sediment-bound atrazine, metolachlor, and glyphosate in surface runoff by 58 to 72%. Four to 8 m of any tested VBS reduced dissolved sulfamethazine transport in the surface runoff by more than 70%. The tall fescue VBS was overall most effective at reducing dissolved tylosin and enrofloxacin transport in the runoff (>75%). The developed exponential regression models can be used to predict expected field-scale results and provide design criteria for effective field implementation of grass buffers. Our study has demonstrated that an optimized VBS design may achieve desired agrochemical reductions and minimize acreage removed from crop production.",1

Carabid beetles are polyphagous predators that can act as biological control agents of insect pests and weeds. While current agricultural practices often create a harsh environment, habitat management such as the establishment of within-field refuges has been proposed to enhance carabid beetle abundance and impact. We examined the joint effects of refuge habitats and insecticide application on carabid activity density (parameter of population density and relative activity) and species composition in a cornfield. 2. Our 2-year study comprised four treatments: (i) ‐refuge/‐insecticide; (ii) + refuge/ ‐insecticide; (iii) ‐refuge/+insecticide; (iv) + refuge/ + insecticide. Refuge strips consisted of grasses, legumes and perennial flowering plants. ‘‐Refuge’ strips were planted with corn and not treated with insecticide. 3. Before planting and insecticide application, carabid activity density in the crop areas was similar across all treatments. Insecticide application immediately reduced carabid activity density and altered community composition in the crop area. 4. Refuge strips had significantly higher activity density of beetles than ‐refuge strips before planting and during the summer. 5. During summer, as new carabids emerged and insecticide toxicity declined, the presence of refuge strips influenced carabids in the adjacent crop area. Carabid activity density within crop areas previously treated with insecticide was significantly higher when adjacent to refuge strips. Also, carabid communities within insecticide-treated crop areas were affected by the presence or absence of a refuge strip. 6. The presence of refuge strips did not consistently augment carabid numbers in crop areas where insecticide was not applied. One explanation may be that insecticides decreased the quality of crop habitat to carabids by depletion of prey and direct mortality. However, subsequent rebounds in prey density and the absence of competing predators may make these areas relatively more attractive than unperturbed crop habitats to carabid colonization from refuges. 7. This study demonstrates that refuges may buffer the negative consequences of insecticide application on carabids in adjacent fields. Diversifying agro-ecosystems with refuge habitats may be a viable strategy for maintaining carabid populations in disturbed agricultural landscapes to keep pests below outbreak levels.",0

Distance from field margins had a greater effect on invertebrate numbers, with most ladybirds (Coccinellidae), hoverflies (Syrphidae), lacewings (Neuroptera) and parasitic wasps (Hymenoptera) recorded from the middle of fields.

1. Management of lowland mesotrophic grasslands in north-west Europe often makes use of inorganic fertilizers, high stocking densities and silage-based forage systems to maximize productivity. The impact of these practices has resulted in a simplification of the plant community combined with wide-scale declines in the species richness of grassland invertebrates. We aim to identify how field margin management can be used to promote invertebrate diversity across a suite of functionally diverse taxa (beetles, planthoppers, true bugs, butterflies, bumblebees and spiders).

2. Using an information theoretic approach we identify the impacts of management (cattle grazing, cutting and inorganic fertilizer) and plant community composition (forb species richness, grass species richness and sward architecture) on invertebrate species richness and body size. As many of these management practices are common to grassland systems throughout the world, understanding invertebrate responses to them is important for the maintenance of biodiversity.

3. Sward architecture was identified as the primary factor promoting increased species richness of both predatory and phytophagous trophic levels, as well as being positively correlated with mean body size. In all cases phytophagous invertebrate species richness was positively correlated with measures of plant species richness.

4. The direct effects of management practices appear to be comparatively weak, suggesting that their impacts are indirect and mediated though the continuous measures of plant community structure, such as sward architecture or plant species richness.

5. Synthesis and applications. By partitioning field margins from the remainder of the field, economically viable intensive grassland management can be combined with extensive management aimed at promoting native biodiversity. The absence of inorganic fertilizer, combined with a reduction in the intensity of both cutting and grazing regimes, promotes floral species richness and sward architectural complexity. By increasing sward architecture the total biomass of invertebrates also increased (by c. 60% across the range of sward architectural measures seen in this study), increasing food available for higher trophic levels, such as birds and mammals.",0

Especially the role of P sorption by soil in buffer zones needs closer examination as there is considerable variation in the efficiency of P retention. Six sites in southern Finland were chosen for the study. The buffer zone areas varied between 0.1–4.9% of the catchment area. A total of 10 kg of solute PO4–P was added to the inflow of the buffer zone areas and the concentrations of PO4–P in inflow and outflow were measured for 2–4 years. P retention characteristics of the surface peat were determined with sorption-desorption isotherms before and after PO4–P addition and the effective buffer zone area over which the added P was spread was determined from soil water samples. P retention in the two largest buffer zone areas was complete (100% retention), and the third largest buffer retained 94%. Retention in the three smallest buffer zones was 24%, 95% and 95% of the added P. As a result of P addition reduction in peat P retention capacity was detected in three out of four cases. The effective buffer zone area varied from 67% to 100% of the total buffer zone area. Factors contributing to efficient P retention were large buffer size and low hydrological load whereas high hydrological load combined with the formation of preferential flow paths, especially during early spring or late autumn was disadvantageous. High P retention capacity in peat contributed to the sustainability of P retention. The study showed that even relatively small buffer zone areas are able to efficiently reduce P load.",0

Many herbivorous species are crop pests, while predatory insects have the potential to act as biological controls against pests. Overall insect diversity has declined as a result of intensified agricultural practices. Riparian buffers may support insect populations in intensively cultivated areas, but their actual impact on the balance between harmful pests and beneficial predators is not known. It can be postulated that this impact may vary depending on the characteristics and location of the riparian buffer itself. We investigated the possibility that the biotic and abiotic attributes of agricultural riparian buffers adjoining crop fields and watercourses can explain the species composition of hemipteran assemblages. In particular, we were interested in the abundances of species belonging to the genus Nabis (generalist predators) and recognized and potential pests of cereal crops. Riparian buffer width and the presence or absence of woody plants were not associated with hemipteran species turnover among riparian buffers. In contrast, differences in the degree of dominance by grasses, in plant species turnover, and in which crop plant was cultivated in the adjacent field, explained a significant proportion of the variance in hemipteran species turnover. The abundance of predatory Nabis species increased with increasing riparian buffer width, whereas the abundance of recognized and potential crop pests decreased. The reverse patterns in the predatory and herbivorous Heteroptera suggest that increasing riparian buffer width might enhance biological control by Nabis predators.",0

For all land uses most of the root biomass was within the 0–20 cm depth range. Total coarse root biomass, to a 60 cm depth, ranged from 8.8-73.7 t/ha in woodlots, 0.6-1.3 t/ha in herbaceous buffers, and 9.2-27.3 t/ha in poplars. Total fine root biomass ranged from 2.68-8.64 t/ha in woodlots, 2.60-3.29 t/ha in herbaceous buffers, and 1.86-2.62 t/ha in poplars. Total root biomass was similar or higher in poplar buffers compared to a 27 year-old grey birch forest. This indicates that poplar buffers accelerated riparian soil colonisation by roots compared to natural secondary succession. Generally, fine root biomass in the surface soil (0–20 cm) was lower in poplar than in herbaceous buffers; the reverse was observed at greater depth. Highest coarse root biomass in the 40–60 cm depth range was observed in a poplar buffer, highlighting the deep rooted nature of poplars. On average, total soil C stocks (0–60 cm) were greater in woodlots than in riparian buffers. On most sites, soil C stocks tended to be lower in poplar buffers compared to adjacent herbaceous buffers, especially in surface soil, probably because of lower fine root biomass in poplar buffers. Across all sites and land uses, highest soil C stocks at the different soil depths were found in the soil layers of woodlots that also had the greatest fine root biomass. Strong positive linear relationships between fine root biomass and soil C stocks in the 0–20 cm depth range (R

The AgB treatment had the highest (173.5 cm/100 cm3) RLD and CG pasture had the lowest (10.8 cm/100 cm3) value. Root carbon was about 3% higher for the buffers compared to RG treatment. Soil carbon was about 115% higher for the buffers compared to pasture treatments. Results from this study imply that establishment of agroforestry and GB on grazed pasture watersheds improve soil carbon accumulation and root parameters which enhance soil physical and chemical properties thus improving the environmental quality of the landscape.",0

Surface run-off caused by natural rainfall and related transport of metolachlor, terbuthylazine and pendimethalin were measured on plots of 40 m length without filter strips (F0), and after passing over three types of herbicide-untreated field margin: 12 m conservation headland (CH12), 6 m (GF6) and 12 m grass strips (GF12). Run-off was also measured after simulated rainfall on 7 m long plots without (F0) and with 3 m grass strips (GF3). All three herbicides were transported both in dissolved and in adsorbed forms; the partitioning depended on their water solubility with metolachlor and terbuthylazine mainly translocated in dissolved form (F0: highest mean concentrations for a natural run-off event 721 and 220 μg L -1 , respectively). Pendimethalin was predominantly transported in adsorbed form (maximum mean concentration 11.2 μg L -1 ). In the sediment, the highest mean herbicide contents in a single natural event (F0) accounted for 2294 μg kg -1 (metolachlor), 1317 μg kg -1 (terbuthylazine) and 5648 μg kg -1 (pendimethalin). The proportions of applied herbicide translocated were 0.3% (metolachlor), 0.2% (terbuthylazine) and 0.06% (pendimethalin; F0, natural rainfall). The extent of herbicide transport decreased with time but within this trend soil sealing, soil moisture and amount and intensity of rainfall increased losses. Compared with the F0 plots, the reduction of herbicide translocation after natural rainfall reached 80-83% (CH12), 80-88% (GF6) and >99% (GF12) over the 3-year period. The 12 m grass strips allowed only one extreme run-off event to pass through, thus providing a highly effective watercourse protection against herbicide pollution.",1

Effects of precipitation, landuse and buffer condition on runoff and sediment loss were examined from 1997 to 1999 in eight watersheds with varying proportions of row-crop, pasture, riparian buffers and grass filter strips. Runoff volume and sediment mass from row-crop watersheds were inversely related to the percentage of forest and pasture cover. Forest (n = 2), pasture (n = 3), row-crop (n = 2) and a row-crop watershed with grass filter strips (RC-GFS) had 3‑yr mean runoff of 939, 1,560, 3,434 and 1,175 m3 ha‑1 yr‑1, respectively. Runoff was greater from all landuses in a year when precipitation was 36% above normal (1998). The largest single runoff event from each watershed accounted for 11 to 25% of its total runoff. Forest, pasture, row-crop and RC-GFS watersheds lost 1,017, 1,241, 3,679 and 2,129 kg ha‑1 yr‑1 of sediment, respectively. In 1998, the RC-GFS watershed lost more sediment than row-crop watersheds and had less runoff and sediment loss in years with normal or below normal precipitation. Row-crop watersheds with 55% pasture reduced runoff and sediment loss by 55 and 66%, respectively, compared to row-crop watersheds. During 90% of the runoff events, more soil was lost from row-crop watersheds than pasture or forest watersheds. Results suggest that 3‑4 m grass filter strips, maintenance of 55% or more pasture/CRP land within row-crop watersheds and intact riparian buffers significantly reduce runoff and sediment losses from row-crop watersheds.",0

Previous research has shown that N fertilizer management alone is not sufficient for reducing NO 3 concentrations in subsurface drainage to acceptable levels; therefore, additional approaches need to be devised. We compared two cropping system modifications for NO 3 concentration and load in subsurface drainage water for a no-till corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) management system. In one treatment, eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides L.) was grown in permanent 3.05-m-wide strips above the tiles. For the second treatment, a rye (Secale cereale L.) winter cover crop was seeded over the entire plot area each year near harvest and chemically killed before planting the following spring. Twelve 30.5 x 42.7-m subsurface-drained field plots were established in 1999 with an automated system for measuring tile flow and collecting flow-weighted samples. Both treatments and a control were initiated in 2000 and replicated four times. Full establishment of both treatments did not occur until fall 2001 because of dry conditions. Treatment comparisons were conducted from 2002 through 2005. The rye cover crop treatment significantly reduced subsurface drainage water flow-weighted NO 3 concentrations and NO 3 loads in all 4 yr. The rye cover crop treatment did not significantly reduce cumulative annual drainage. Averaged over 4 yr, the rye cover crop reduced flow-weighted NO 3 concentrations by 59% and loads by 61%. The gamagrass strips did not significantly reduce cumulative drainage, the average annual flow-weighted NO 3 concentrations, or cumulative NO 3 loads averaged over the 4 yr. Rye winter cover crops grown after corn and soybean have the potential to reduce the NO 3 concentrations and loads delivered to surface waters by subsurface drainage systems.",0

To determine how pollinators utilise different habitats within an intensive grassland landscape, bumblebees and butterflies were monitored across a range of agricultural and semi-natural habitats using standardised transect walks. Few pollinators were recorded in intensively managed arable and grassland fields indicating that such habitats provided poor foraging resources. Hedgerows also yielded few pollinators reflecting the lack of pollen and nectar bearing plant species within hedgerows in this landscape. The highest density of pollinators, and richest pollinator assemblages, were recorded in open scrub, road verges and riparian buffer strips. This was most likely the result of such habitats supporting a diverse array of flowering plant species which in turn provided foraging opportunities for pollinators. These prime pollinator habitats should be managed to ensure that they maintain rich botanical assemblages and thus to ensure a continuous supply of nectar and pollen throughout the season.",0

These oods are triggered when high quantities of runo are generated on cropland and cause severe erosion. Three soil surface characteristics are relevant to determine the runo potential of cultivated soils: soil cover by crops and residues, soil surface crust-ing and roughness. These characteristics have been observed on 65 cultivated elds throughout 2005. A heavy rainfall event representative for events triggering muddy oods in the region (60 mm.h −1 during 30 minutes) has been simulated using a 0.5 m 2 simulator on elds with the 17 most observed combinations of soil surface characteristics in central Belgium. In the case of (ploughed) bare uncrusted soils, runo is not observed, nor in the case of soils covered by crops, showing a transitional crust and a moderate roughness (1-2 cm). In the cases where runo has been observed, mean runo coecients ranged from 13% (wheat in July) to 58% (sugar beet or maize in May and June). Grassed buer strips (GBS) and grassed waterways (GWW) show a higher runo coecient (62% for GBS and 73% for GWW) than most cultivated soils (13-58%). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that small plot measurements can be used to estimate runo generation at the eld scale. A classication of runo generation risk based on the surveys of soil surface characteristics has been applied to common crops of central Belgium. February as well as the period between May and September are the most critical for runo at the eld scale.

The detection rate was higher in winter and autumn than in spring and summer because of the confluence of different biological and environmental factors. Red squirrels were mainly arboreal, though they used the ground to some degree throughout the year. The height at which individuals were seen in shrubs/trees was maximum in spring related to intensive use of high poplars. A seasonal variation in plant selection was found. Red squirrels selected oaks, ivy and poplars positively in winter, poplars, ashes and willows in spring, hazels, wild cherries and willows in summer, and hazels, ashes and willows in autumn, linked with shelter, nest-site and food requirements.

Riparian buffer strips can effectively remove sediment and nutrients from surface runoff. A field-scale study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the integrated poplar (Populus)-grass buffer strips with different tree planting density in reducing sediment, N, and P from agricultural runoff during natural rainfall events in Taihu Lake watershed, eastern China. The experimental site consisted of four treatments, including a control plot with no buffer strip (T0) and three poplar-grass buffer strips with different planting densities of 1,346 trees ha−1 (T1), 769 trees ha−1 (T2), and 577 trees ha−1 (T3) with planting spacing of 2 × 5 m (6.5 × 16.4 ft), 4 × 5 m (13.1 × 16.4 ft), and 6 × 5 m (19.7 × 16.4 ft), respectively. The integrated poplar-grass buffer strips significantly reduced runoff volume, sediment, total N, and total P masses by 49.3% to 61.6%, 78.7% to 90.2%, 57.2% to 71.5%, and 65.4% to 81.4%, respectively. With increasing poplar planting density in buffer strips, the canopy interception and maximum water storage capacity of litter layer increased, while the loss of sediments and nutrients from runoff decreased. There was significantly higher removal efficiency in buffer T1 than that in buffers T2 and T3 for sediment, particle-bound N (PN), and particle-bound P (PP). There was no significant difference in removal efficiency for ammonium as N (NH4-N), nitrate as N (NO3-N), and phosphate P (PO4-P) between buffers T1 and T2. According to different rainfall regimes, we found that the reduction in runoff volume, sediment, and nutrients load for buffers were higher under mild-long duration events (rainfall intensity class 2 to 4 mm h−1 [0.078 to 0.15 in hr−1]) and lower under intense-short duration events (rainfall intensity class 6 to 8 mm h−1 [0.23 to 0.31 in hr−1]). The removal efficiency of the buffers was negatively correlated with both precipitation and rainfall intensity, and the rainfall intensity had more effect on the removal efficiency than the precipitation. The results indicated that the impact of tree planting density on the effectiveness of buffer strips depended on the measured parameter. That is, the impact on sediment, PN, and PP was greater than that on the soluble N and P. The effect of tree planting density on the performance of buffer strips is mainly due to the interception of canopy and litter layer.",0

A field plot study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of an established multi-species buffer in trapping sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus from cropland runoff during natural rainfall events. Triplicate plots were installed in a previously established buffer with a 4.1 by 22.1 m (14 × 73 ft.) cropland source area paired with either no buffer, a 7.1 m (23 ft) switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L. cv. Cave-n-Rock) buffer, or a 16.3 m (53.5 ft) switchgrass/woody buffer (7.1 m swithgrass/9.2 m woody) located at the lower end of each plot. The switchgrass buffer removed 95% of the sediment, 80% of the total-nitrogen (N), 62% of the nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), 78% of the total-phosphorus (P), and 58% of the phosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P). The switchgrass/woody buffer removed 97% of the sediment, 94% of the total-N, 85% of the NO3-N, 91% of the total-P, and 80% of the PO4-P in the runoff. There was a significant negative correlation between the trapping effectiveness of the buffers and the intensity and total rainfall of individual storms. While the 7 m (23 ft) switchgrass buffer was effective in removing sediment and sediment-bound nutrients, the added width of the 16.3 m (53.5 ft) switchgrass/woody buffer increased the removal efficiency of soluble nutrients by over 20%. Similar or even greater reductions might have been found if the 16.3 m (53.5 ft) buffer had been planted completely to native warm-season grasses. In this buffer, combinations of the dense, stiff, native warm-season grass and woody vegetation improved the removal effectiveness for the nonpoint source pollutants from agricultural areas.",1

Four treatments with PFS of different size and location (100% rowcrop, 10% PFS of total watershed area at footslope, 10% PFS at footslope and in contour strips, 20% PFS at footslope and in contour strips) arranged in a balanced incomplete block design were seeded in July 2007. All watersheds were in bromegrass (Bromus L.) for at least 10 yr before treatment establishment. Cropped areas were managed under a no-till, 2-yr corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max. (L.) Merr.] rotation beginning in 2007. About 38 to 85% of the total sediment export from cropland occurred during the early growth stage of rowcrop due to wet field conditions and poor ground cover. The greatest sediment load was observed in 2008 due to the initial soil disturbance and gradually decreased thereafter. The mean annual sediment yield through 2010 was 0.36 and 8.30 Mg ha-1 for the watersheds with and without PFS, respectively, a 96% sediment trapping efficiency for the 4-yr study period. The amount and distribution of PFS had no significant impact on runoff and sediment yield, probably due to the relatively large width (37-78m) of footslope PFS. The findings suggest that incorporation of PFS at the footslope position of annual rowcrop systems provides an effective approach to reducing sediment loss in runoff from agricultural watersheds under a no-till system.",1

While there have been many studies of the transport of pollutants through grass filter strips, few have addressed sediment related processes through restored tree belts. In order to identify these processes and quantify their relative contribution to sediment trapping, a series of rainfall simulations was conducted on a 600 m2 hillslope comprising a pasture upslope of a 15 year old tree belt. Although the simulated events were extreme (average recurrence intervals ∼10 and 50 yr), the trapping efficiency of the tree belt was very high: at least 94% of the total mass of sediments was captured. All the size fractions were trapped with a minimum Sediment Trapping Ratio (STR) of 91% for the medium-sized fragments. Fractions 182 µm were totally captured (STR = 100%). Through the joint analysis of sediment budgets and soil surface conditions, we identified different trapping processes. The main trapping process is the sedimentation (at least 62% of trapped sediment mass) with deposits in the backwater and as micro-terraces within the tree belt. Modelling results show that the coarsest size fractions above 75 µm are preferentially deposited. Joint infiltration of water and sediments has also been noticed, however, this process alone cannot explain the selective trapping of the finest fractions. We suggest that the finest fractions transported by the overland flow may be trapped by adsorption on the abundant litter present within the tree belt. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0

The EU ‘Nitrates Directive’ (Directive 91 ⁄ 676 ⁄ EEC) and the WFD (Water Framework Directive 2000 ⁄ 60 ⁄ EEC) introduced a series of measures designed to reduce and prevent water pollution caused or induced by nitrates from agricultural sources. Therefore, there is an urgent requirement to control the nitrate concentration in freshwater. The objective of this paper was to verify the potential capacity of a specifically designed afforested riparian zone in removing the excess of nitrogen from river water. 2. A buffer zone was set with irrigation ditches, to produce a subsurface water flow carrying water from the study river through the buffer strip to drainage ditches. This experimental system enables the co-occurrence of two main processes: vegetation ⁄ microbial nitrogen uptake and denitrification. Both in situ denitrification and denitrification potential were measured at different soil depths, and nitrogen removal of water passing through the buffer system was measured. 3. After the first year, high removal rates (63–64%) of total nitrogen in water were recorded. The lowest rate of denitrification took place in the upper soil layer, while maximum denitrification occurred in the medium layer (40–55 cm). Denitrification occurred mainly in the first few metres of the irrigation ditches leading away from the river. The denitrification rates clearly increased from the second to the third year, with highest rates in summer and autumn. Denitrification potential indicated that carbon availability was the most limiting factor. 4. Synthesis and applications. This study has demonstrated that nitrogen levels can be reduced in rivers by forcing water to circulate through afforested buffers. Nitrogen was removed both by plants and by microbial denitrification. Such activity can be supported by promoting anoxic conditions through appropriate water flow management. This could be achieved by creating semi-natural floodplains where water flows can be efficiently managed as in a drained wetland.",0

Two of the shelterbelts in question were of the single-row type. The remaining two consisted of at least two rows of deciduous trees and in both cases some conifers. Wind measurements were made under various weather conditions, both in winter and in summer. The minimum relative wind speed on the lee side varied from ca 0.1 behind the most dense shelterbelt to 0.4 behind the most porous one when the wind was blowing at right angles in summer. In the winter, the shelter effect was much less than in the summer but the two most dense shelterbelts did reduce the wind speed considerably also then. When the wind was blowing at an angle to the shelterbelt, the lee maximum occurred closer to the belt and the wind speed recovered faster than when it blew at right angles. The wind reduction just behind a shelterbelt always tended to be greater in oblique than in perpendicular wind. The wind reduction behind a leafy vegetation belt decreased as the reference wind speed increased. The approach wind speed affected wind reduction much more at a porous shelterbelt than at a dense one. The difference between reference and local wind directions could be great just behind a shelterbelt but this difference disappeared within a few h downstream of the belt. With further increasing distance (up to 4–11h), the wind continued to veer so that the direction became more parallel with the shelterbelt than in the case of the undisturbed wind. Then the wind slowly veered back to the direction of the approaching wind again. The present data give a good idea of the amount of wind reduction which can be expected in the lee of some common types of shelterbelts.",1

Shelterbelts may also play a role in acting as reservoirs for organisms that are beneficial to pastures, although this has rarely been directly evaluated. We sampled invertebrates along transects running from replicated shelterbelts into pastures, and in glasshouse trials we tested the impact of the beneficial organisms from the shelterbelts on the collected pests. Contrary to popular views, numbers of pest mites and lucerne fleas were low within shelterbelts. Moreover, numbers were typically lower adjacent to shelterbelts compared with >30 m into the pasture, an effect that was much more apparent when shelterbelts carried a groundcover of high (>30 cm) grass. Numbers of predatory mites and spiders were higher in shelterbelts and in adjacent pasture when there was taller grass and higher grass cover in the shelterbelts. Samples of potential predators collected from a shelterbelt were more effective at suppressing pest mite numbers than those collected in pasture. Shelterbelts with ground cover appear to harbour a diversity of beneficial organisms that suppress pest numbers in adjacent pastures.",0

Yet, the short-term spatial and temporal variability in GHG emission in these systems is poorly understood. Using two transects of three static chambers at two North Carolina agricultural riparian zones (one restored, one unrestored), we show that estimates of the average GHG flux at the site scale can vary by one order of magnitude depending on whether the mean or the median is used as a measure of central tendency. Because the median tends to mute the effect of outlier points (hot spots and hot moments), we propose that both must be reported or that other more advanced spatial averaging techniques (e.g., kriging, area-weighted average) should be used to estimate GHG fluxes at the site scale. Results also indicate that short-term temporal variability in GHG fluxes (a few days) under seemingly constant temperature and hydrological conditions can be as large as spatial variability at the site scale, suggesting that the scientific community should rethink sampling protocols for GHG at the soil-atmosphere interface to include repeated measures over short periods of time at select chambers to estimate GHG emissions in the field. Although recent advances in technology provide tools to address these challenges, their cost is often too high for widespread implementation. Until technology improves, sampling design strategies will need to be carefully considered to balance cost, time, and spatial and temporal representativeness of measurements.",1

However, information on the long-term development of field margin plant communities remains limited. We describe a long-term experiment on the effects of field margin management on biodiversity and weed species. Swards were established by natural regeneration or sowing a grass and wildflower seed mixture, and treatments manipulated the frequency and timing of mowing, application of herbicide and leaving of hay. Vegetation was monitored to evaluate the extent to which early conclusions remained valid after 13 years. Although early successional trends suggested that naturally regenerated swards would rapidly become dominated by pernicious perennial weeds, and that sown swards would exclude such species, neither was true in the longer term. Sown swards were eventually invaded by unsown perennials, but they remained distinct from naturally regenerated swards. Plant species richness declined throughout the experiment. Annuals were lost most rapidly from sown swards but, under natural regeneration, loss could be modified by mowing. Perennial species initially increased during natural regeneration before stabilising. In sown swards they declined under all treatments. Species richness in naturally regenerating swards was promoted initially by mowing twice annually. After 13 years, timing and frequency of mowing had no significant effect on species richness although it still influenced sward composition. Leaving cut hay lying produced species-poor swards. We conclude that the choice of establishment and management methods for arable field margins significantly affects the long-term conservation value of the swards.",0

In the current study slug numbers and damage were estimated in wildfiower strips and at different distances from the strips into winter wheat crops, from 1994 to 1996. Slug damage was estimated using an index of defoliation and slug numbers and activity were measured using wheat bran traps. Investigations began when winter wheat seedlings emerged and lasted for five weeks. Slug damage was never severe in any of the fields studied. In most fields, slug damage was higher close to the wildfiower strips than at greater distances from the strips. The declining slug damage with increasing distances from the wildflowers strips was related to the distribution pattern of juvenile Arion lusitanicus, suggesting that this species was responsible for the higher damage near the strips. Other slug species (Deroceras reticulatum, Arion fasciatus, Deroceras laeve) were more or less evenly distributed over the field or were almost entirely confined to the wildflower strips. Results showed that winter wheat was not at risk from slug feeding in spite of the establishment of wildfiower strips and that therefore the application of molluscicide along the strips is unnecessary.",1

Deroceras reticulatum was the most abundant slug species recorded in both grass strips and adjacent rape fields. Arion lusitanicus and Arion fasciatus were much less abundant than D. reticulatum. In one field, D. reticulatum declined steadily with increasing distance from the grass strips and therefore appeared to have caused the majority of severe damage to rape plants close to the strips. This finding was surprising because until now severe slug damage in oilseed rape beside semi-natural habitats has been observed only where A. lusitanicus was abundant.",0

Population changes were less clear in yellow-necked mouse and bank vole but the yellow-necked mouse was more scarce in the second year of study. Common shrews were most numerous in summer and declined rapidly in autumn. Hedgerow coppicing had a marked effect on yellow-necked mouse numbers but not on wood mouse. In an extensive survey of mammal numbers in relation to hedgerow features, ground cover was found to be the single largest factor influencing size of bank vole populations. Hedgerow condition (lack of gaps) was important to yellow-necked mice, which thrived only in well-established hedgerows. Wood mice appeared little influenced by the characteristics of the hedge.

However, traditional fallow field borders lack nectar sources required to sustain beneficial insect communities, and their value to small mammals is not well-understood. In October–November 2009, we trapped small mammals in four field-border treatments (planted native, warm-season grasses and prairie flowers, planted prairie flowers only, fallow vegetation, and frequently mowed vegetation) replicated around nine organic crop fields, and developed closed-population models in Program MARK to estimate abundance in each border. We also measured vegetation cover within each border treatment from June to August 2009. We captured 491 individuals of two species, the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) and house mouse (Mus musculus). Cotton rat abundance was ≥2 times greater in grass and flower borders and flowers-only borders than in fallow borders, likely because of greater vegetation density and availability of preferred foods in planted borders. No cotton rats were captured in mowed borders, and house mouse abundance was ≥5 times lower in mowed borders than in other border types. Lower abundance of cotton rats and house mice in mowed borders emphasizes the importance of structurally complex non-crop vegetation for supporting small-mammal communities in agricultural landscapes. Field borders planted to promote beneficial insects may be a useful tool for maximizing the ecological services provided by non-crop vegetation. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.",0

The results of this study, which surveyed 38 farm woods ranging in size from 0.05 to 4.45 ha, demonstrated clearly that the dynamics of wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus and bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus populations in small woods are strongly influenced by the landscape around the woods, for example the distance to neighbouring woods, abundance of hedges and types of crops grown, as well as the habitat within the wood. 2. In terms of the habitat features of the woods, the maturity of the wood and the amount of understorey and overstorey cover were important for both species, while the availability of herbaceous plants influenced bank vole abundance. 3. Wood mice, in particular, were influenced by the types of crops grown in neighbouring fields. Their abundance in spring, the proportion of juveniles in the autumn and the extent to which the population increased from spring to autumn were all influenced by the proportion of adjoining fields that were planted with wheat and/or oilseed rape. 4. Isolation variables, such as the distance to the nearest large wood and the extent of adjoining hedgerows, influenced both wood mice and bank vole populations. Populations of both species increased more from spring to autumn in more isolated woods. This was probably because of reduced opportunities for dispersal and the shortage of alternative woodland habitat for animals moving off the fields after harvest. Woods well connected with hedges supported higher densities of both wood mice and bank voles. 5. Within the size range of woods examined here, no effect of woodland size was found on the probability of catching wood mice or bank voles or their abundance in either spring or autumn. The data suggest that even very small farm woods are important as refuges for small mammals, particularly after harvest when arable fields provide little cover.",1

Based on correlations between habitat variables characterizing vegetative features of shelterbelts and numbers of individuals captured in each season, Peromyscus leucopus and Clethrionomys gapperi were considered as woodland species, Microtus pennsylvanicus as a grassland species, and Sorex cinereus and Blarina brevicauda as intermediate in terms of their dependency on shelterbelts. Area and perimeter of shelterbelts were associated with numbers of all species except C. gapperi. Numbers of P. leucopus and C. gapperi tended to be higher in shelterbelts that were isolated from other wooded habitat, whereas numbers of S. cinereus were lower in isolated shelterbelts. Species richness was greater in larger shelterbelts with complex vegetative structure. Species of small mammals residing in shelterbelts were those that typically are not considered as agricultural pests. Management recommendations include maintenance practices that do not reduce stratification of vegetation, leaving woody and man-made debris within shelterbelts, and establishing shelterbelts that are as large as possible within the economic constraints of farming. These recommendations simultaneously would benefit other species of mammals and birds in the intensively farmed regions of the Midwest. J. WILDL.

Rolled oats mixed with small amounts of peanut butter were used as bait.

Five switchgrass barriers were established in 1998 at ∼38-m intervals parallel to the crop rows in a field under a conventional tillage and no-till grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]–corn (Zea mays L.) rotation. Compared with the cropped area, switchgrass barriers accumulated about 0.85 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ of SOC and 80 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ of total soil N at the 0 to 15 cm soil depth. Switchgrass barriers also increased coarse POM by 60%. Mean weight diameter of water-stable aggregates increased by 70% at 0 to 15 cm and by 40% at 15 to 60 cm, indicating that switchgrass barriers improved soil aggregation at deeper depths. Large (4.75–8 mm) macroaggregates under switchgrass barriers contained 30% more SOC than those under the cropped area. Switchgrass-induced changes in SOC concentration were positively associated with aggregate stability (r = 0.89***) and porosity (r = 0.47*). Overall, switchgrass barriers integrated with intensively managed agroecosystems can increase the SOC pool and improve soil structural properties.",0

Pasture and GB areas included red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) and lespedeza (Kummerowia stipulacea Maxim.) planted into fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb..) while AgB included Eastern cottonwood trees (Populus deltoids Bortr. ex Marsh.) planted into fescue. Water retention data were measured at -0.4, -1.0, -2.5, -5.0, -10, -20, and -30 kPa (-0.058, -0.145, -0.363, -0.725, -1.45, -2.90, -4.35 pounds per square inch [psi]) soil water pressures using 76 mm (3.00 in) diameter by 76 mm long cores from the 0 to 10 cm, 10 to 20 cm, 20 to 30 cm, and 30 to 40 cm (0 to 3.94 in 3.94 to 7.87 in, 7.87 to 11.81 in, and 11.81 to 15.75 in) depths. Soil bulk density was 12.6% higher for the RG and CG treatments (1.41 and 1.45 g cm 3 (88.02 and 90.52 lb ft -3 ]) than the GB and Agl3 treatments (1.25 and 1.29 g cm -3 |78.03 and 80.53 1b fr -3 ). Soil water content at high soil water potentials (0 and -0.4 kPa) was greater in the buffer treatments relative to the other treatments for the 0 to 10 cm soil depth. Soil macroporosity (>1,000 μm [>0.0394 in] diameter) was 5.7, 4.5, and 3.9 times higher, respectively, for the AgB, GB, and RG treatments compared to the CG treatment for the 0 to 10 cm soil depth.

This study evaluated soil hydraulic properties within a grass hedge system 10 yr after establishment. The study was conducted at the USDA-ARS research station near Treynor, IA in a field managed with switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) hedges. The soil was classified as Monona silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls). Three positions were sampled: within the grass hedges, within the deposition zone 0.5 m upslope from the grass hedges, and within the row crop area 7 m upslope from the hedges. Intact soil samples (76 by 76 mm) were taken from the three positions at four depths (100-mm increments) to determine saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (K sat ), bulk density (ρ b ), and soil water retention. The grass hedge position had significantly greater (P < 0.05) macroporosity than the row crop and deposition positions in the first two depths and greater than the deposition position in the last two depths. The K sat within the grass hedge (668 mm h -1 ) was six times greater than in the row crop position (115 mm h -1 ) and 18 times greater than in the deposition position (37 mm h -1 ) for the surface 10 cm. Bulk density and macroporosity were found to provide the best two-parameter regression model for predicting the log-transformed K sat (R 2 = 0.68). These results indicate that grass hedges significantly affected soil hydraulic properties for this loess soil.",1

Studies were carried out in the Gen. D. Chlapowski Landscape Park near Turew, Western Poland (16045’E, 52001’W). The age of shelterbelts vegetation affected soil mesofauna of adjacent fields in a diverse way. The mean density of mites amounts 7.4 × 103ind. m–2 and 2.6 × 103 ind. m–2 respectively for the shelterbelts and fields. Densities of Acarina communities were affected not only by the presence of a shelterbelt (P = 0.000) but also its age (P = 0.02) and the distance from it (P = 0.000), and these effects were similar in spring and autumn (P = 0.08). The mean density of springtail noted in shelterbelts of different age was 2.0 × 103 ind. m–2 and in the field sites 2.2 × 103 ind. m–2. Although the effect of the shelterbelts’ age on the density of Collembola was not found (P = 0.3), the densities were different in shelterbelts and in adjacent fields (P = 0.006) but statistical significance was found only between spring and autumn (P = 0.000). The distance from the shelterbelt influenced (though less intensely) the density of Collembola on adjacent field (P = 0.01). Eighteen species of Collembola were found in studied shelterbelts and fields. Isotoma notabilis Schaff. usually dominated in shelterbelts. Its contribution to abundance of communities varied depending on the age of shelterbelts (in 6 years old shelterbelt it constituted as many as 71% of the whole community). In 11 years old shelterbelt Schoetella ununguiculata (Tullb.), was more common than Isotoma notabilis Schaff. and in the 170 years old shelterbelt the dominant species was Onychiurus armatus (Tullb.).

This study compared soil CO and CH fluxes in adjacent crop fields and riparian buffers (a flood-prone forest and a flood-protected grassland along an incised channel) and examined the impact of water table depth (WTD) and flood events on the variability of gas fluxes in riparian zones. Results showed significantly ( 22°C), but the effect of flooding was less pronounced in early spring (emission <1.06 mg CH-C m d), probably due to low soil temperature. Although CH flux direction alternated at all sites, overall the croplands and the flood-affected riparian forest were CH sources, with annual emission averaging +0.04 ± 0.17 and +0.92 ± 1.6 kg CH-C ha, respectively. In the riparian forest, a topographic depression (<8% of the total area) accounted for 78% of the annual CH emission, underscoring the significance of landscape heterogeneity on CH dynamics in riparian buffers. The nonflooded riparian grassland, however, was a net CH sink (-1.08 ± 0.22 kg CH-C ha yr), probably due to the presence of subsurface tile drains and a dredged/incised channel at that study site. Although these hydrological alterations may have contributed to improvement in the CH sink strength of the riparian grassland, this must be weighed against the water quality maintenance functions and other ecological services provided by riparian buffers.",0

Our objective was to examine the effects of these land uses on the activities of selected enzymes (β-glucosidase, β-glucosaminidase, fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolase, and dehydrogenase), proportion of water stable aggregates (WSA), soil organic carbon and total nitrogen content. Four management treatments [grazed pasture (GP), agroforestry buffer (AgB), grass buffer (GB) and row crop (RC)] were sampled in 2009 and 2010 at two depths (0 to 10- and 10 to 20-cm) and analyzed. Most of the soil quality indicators were significantly greater under perennial vegetation when compared to row crop treatments. Although there were numerical variations, soil quality response trends were consistent between years. The β-glucosaminidase activity increased slightly from 156 to 177 μg PNP g−1 dry soil while β-glucosidase activity slightly decreased from 248 to 237 μg PNP g−1 dry soil in GB treatment during 2 years. The surface (0–10 cm depth) had greater enzyme activities and WSA than sub-surface (10–20 cm) samples. WSA increased from 178 to 314 g kg−1 in row crop areas while all other treatments had similar values during the 2 year study. The treatment by depth interaction was significant (P < 0.05) for β-glucosidase and β-glucosaminidase enzymes in 2009 and for dehydrogenase and β-glucosaminidase in 2010. Soil enzyme activities were significantly correlated with soil organic carbon content (r ≥ 0.94, P < 0.0001). This is important because soil enzyme activities and microbial biomass can be enhanced by perennial vegetation and thus improve several other soil quality parameters. These results also support the hypothesis that positive interactions among management practices, soil biota and subsequent environmental quality effects are of great agricultural and ecological importance.",0

The study was conducted in riparian cool-season grass buffers, in re-established multispecies (switchgrass + poplar) riparian buffers and in adjacent crop (maize and soybean) fields. The objectives were to determine the variability in soil respiration among buffer types and crop fields within a riparian landscape, and to identify those factors correlating with the observed differences. Soil respiration was measured approximately monthly over a two-year period using the soda-lime technique. Mean daily soil respiration across all treatments ranged from 0.14 to 8.3 g C m−2 d−1. There were no significant differences between cool-season grass buffers and re-established forest buffers, but respiration rates beneath switchgrass were significantly lower than those beneath cool-season grass. Soil respiration was significantly greater in both buffer systems than in the cropped fields. Seasonal changes in soil respiration were strongly related to temperature changes. Over all sites, soil temperature and soil moisture together accounted for 69% of the seasonal variability in soil respiration. Annual soil respiration rates correlated strongly with soil organic carbon (R = 0.75, P < 0.001) and fine root (<2 mm) biomass (R = 0.85, P < 0.001). Annual soil respiration rates averaged 1140 g C m−2 for poplar, 1185 g C m−2 for cool-season grass, 1020 g C m−2 for switchgrass, 750 g C m−2 for soybean and 740 g C m−2 for corn. Overall, vegetated buffers had significantly higher soil respiration rates than did adjacent crop fields, indicating greater soil biological activity within the buffers.",0

To test the hypothesis that agroforestry buffers reduce runoff by increased infiltration, water use, and water storage; profile water content and soil water infiltration were measured for a Putnam soil (fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Albaqualf). The watershed was under no-till management with a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation since 1991. Agroforestry buffer strips, 4.5 m wide and 36.5 m apart, were planted with redtop (Agrostis gigantea Roth), brome (Bromus spp.), and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.). Pin oak (Quercus palustris Muenchh.), swamp white oak (Q. bicolor Willd.) and bur oak (Q. macrocarpa Michx.) trees were planted at 3-m intervals in the center of the agroforestry buffers in 1997. Ponded water infiltration was measured in agroforestry and grass buffers and row crop areas. Water content in agroforestry and row crop areas at 5, 10, 20, and 40 cm depths were measured throughout the year. Quasi-steady infiltration rates were not different (P > 0.05) among the treatments. Agroforestry had lower soil water content than row crop areas (P < 0.05) during the growing season. Higher water content after the principal recharge event in the agroforestry treatment was attributed to better infiltration through the root system. Results show that agroforestry buffer strips reduce soil water content during critical times such as fallow periods, and increase water infiltration and water storage. Therefore, adoption of agroforestry buffer practices may reduce runoff and soil loss from watersheds in row crop management.",0

Our objective is to evaluate the influence of a bottomland hedgerow on water flux in the saturated and unsaturated zones. Soil water movement was investigated in a hillslope crossed by a hedgerow using total water-potential gradients and shallow groundwater dynamics. Results of a dry year were presented by Ghazavi et al. (2008). In this study, we analyse a wet year and then compare the two contrasting years (dry and wet). During the 2 years, the soil located at the vicinity of the hedgerow developed a drier status than the surrounding soils. Water flux in the unsaturated zone was directed towards the hedgerow for a longer period during the dry year than the wet year. The duration of delayed rewetting of the soil decreased from 3 months for the dry year to 1 month for the wet year. Variation in water storage calculated over the study period was highest near the hedgerow and lowest far from the hedgerow.



In the hillslope studied, hedgerow and stream proximity controlled water transfer. It is clear that the hedgerow controlled water transfer in the unsaturated zone throughout the year, except for the period when the soil profile was fully saturated. First, hedgerows control water transfer by increasing lateral transfer, which is related to high soil water potential gradients in its vicinity. These processes may increase capillary rise and decrease groundwater recharge near the hedgerow. Second, reverse hydraulic gradient (upward flux of water) occurred during the period of lowest groundwater level, mainly because of groundwater and stream connectivity. Processes related to hedgerow presence, such as delayed soil rewetting and flow towards the hedgerow need to be considered to quantify the impact of linear vegetation structures on water flux.

Cumulative infiltration did not differ significantly (P < 0.05) among corn and soybean crop fields and the pasture. Soil bulk densities under the multi-species buffer vegetation were significantly (P < 0.05) smaller than in the crop fields and the pasture. Other measured parameters did not show consistent trends.

University of Missouri--Columbia 2011.""December 2011""Understanding sorption and transport of veterinary antibiotics (VAs) is important for assessing the risk of VAs reaching water resources. Vegetative buffer strips (VBS) may be a useful tool for mitigating veterinary antibiotic transport from agricultural lands. Sorption experiment results showed that oxytetracycline (OTC) was strongly adsorbed and not readily extractable, while sulfadimethoxine (SDT) and sulfamethazine (SMZ) were highly mobile in soil. For all the antibiotics studied, VBS soils had higher sorption capacity than cropland soils. Linear regression analyses indicate that clay content and pH were the most important soil properties controlling OTC and SDT adsorption, respectively. For SMZ, organic carbon content, pH, initial SMZ concentration, and clay content were the most important factors controlling sorption. Dissolved organic matter had a slight negative effect on SMZ sorption. Transport experiments of SMZ were conducted in glass columns repacked with agroforestry and cropland soils. Computer modeling using HYDRUS-1D software indicated that a three-site model containing two reversible sites and one irreversible site coupled with the Freundlich sorption component best describes SMZ transport through the columns. Data from equilibrium sorption experiments and column transport experiments suggest that the AGF soil has a larger capacity to retain SMZ than the cropland soil. Overall, this research facilitates our understanding of VA sorption and transport in the environment and supports the use of vegetative buffers to mitigate VA loss from agroecosystems.Includes bibliographical reference",1

Summary

Sown grass strips have been widely established on field margins across France, because of their expected environmental benefits. They may also enhance the diversity of plant species in the adjacent boundary by buffering them from agricultural practices. However, the strips could act as an extended reservoir for weeds and increase their dispersal into the field. This study evaluated the impact of a 5-m-wide sown grass strip on (i) the weed richness, abundance and diversity of both boundary and field adjacent habitats and on (ii) the width of the edge zone within the field, defined as the zone where boundary habitats impact the flora in the field. We surveyed the flora in 10 fields along continuous transects running from the boundary toward the centre of the field on opposite sides of each field, one side with a sown grass strip and one side without. The establishment of sown grass strips did not change the overall species richness at the field scale, but modified its distribution in the different habitats. In the boundaries, plant species richness, total abundance or diversity (Shannon index) remained unchanged when a sown grass strip was present, whereas these indicators sharply decreased in the crop edge (−10.9 species and −86.4 individuals per 1.25 m2) and in the field margin (−3.6 species and −9.6 individuals per 1.25 m2) where the grass strip was present. Sown grass strips also significantly decreased the width of the edge zone, from 6.5 to 1.5 m for species richness and from 12 to 1 m for species diversity, demonstrating a decrease in weed ingress into the crop.",0

Canonical correspondence analysis was used to arrange ground beetles along temporal and spatial gradients. Autumn and spring assemblages of ground beetles were separated along the 1st canonical axis. The 2nd canonical axis further separated spring and winter assemblages of ground beetles. With the effects of season removed, ground beetles were classified with respect to habitat association along axes 1 and 2 of a partial canonical correspondence analysis. Based on this analysis, ground beetles occupying wheat field interiors and wheat field edges were separated from those occupying riparian interiors and riparian edges along the 1st canonical axis. The 2nd canonical axis separated beetles occupying interior habitats from those occupying edge habitats. We classified beetles as habitat generalists, wheat specialists, riparian specialists, or boundary specialists.

However, assessments of their impact on field-scale spatial variability in crop performance are rare. A case of practices affecting spatial crop response at field level in a systematic way is the contour hedgerow system, a widespread soil conservation technique on steep lands in the tropics. The objectives of this study were to assess: (i) spatial variability in crop response under contour hedgerow systems in the Andes and (ii) implications for management of steep land alley farming. In order to measure spatial variability in crop response, Triticum aestivum was sown in rows following the contours, placed every 25 cm along the slope direction. Grain yield was monitored on eight alleys, having slopes from 15 to 30%, a length of 4–8 m and soils ranging from Dystri-Vertic Cambisols to Haplic Phaeozem, in the Andes region of Ecuador. In order to relate crop response with soil fertility, soil sampling was carried out in bands following the contour. Top soil properties, such as organic carbon, N Total , NO 3 − , P, exchangeable Aluminium, P fixation, exchangeable bases, CEC and texture, were analysed. The barrier strips of the contour hedgerow systems were composed of: (i) Pennisetum clandestinum and Lolium multiflorum or (ii) Phalaris tuberosa . Spatial variability in crop response was described by fourth-order polynomial equations, where position in the alley was the independent variable and plant characteristics were the dependent variables. Grain yield ranged from 0.8 to 4.0 t ha −1 (net area). Clear and significant patterns of spatial variability in crop response were found in all alleys, with R 2 varying from 0.55 to 0.90. Crop response was strongly and positively correlated with NO 3 − , P, exchangeable bases or organic carbon, dependent on the management, age and soil conditions of the alleys. Tillage erosion and soil accumulation on respectively the upper and lower elevations of the alleys were the main causes for a tendency to a significantly increased crop response along the slope direction. However, according the type of grass used in the barrier strip, competition for soil fertility and soil moisture occurred and influenced in negative way crop productivity in the lower elevations of the alleys. An index is proposed to assess the effect of contour hedgerows on crop response. The present study shows that contour hedgerow systems cannot always be evaluated as completely positive. Soil fertility improvement on the upper part of the alleys and a better management of the barrier strip are suggested to enhance crop productivity of contour hedgerow systems.",0

The oldest weed strip contained the highest number of ground beetle species in both years. A decrease in number of species with increasing distance from the weed strips was observed in 1992. Fields bordering on two-year-old weed strips showed an increase in species diversity compared with the previous year. Within the crops, rape contained more species than wheat or maize. The extent of differences in species diversity between weed strips and adjacent fields in terms of the methodology used and the importance of weed strips for several species are discussed.",0

Oxyopidae was the most frequent family in the herbaceous layer of both the margins and the soybean crop, and Lycosidae in the lower layer; 2. Margin strips in a soybean lot contribute to the colonization of the crop by spiders of aerial habits and also promote re-colonization following pesticide applications, since they act as shelters. The influence on spiders of terrestrial habits was somewhat lower; 3. The distribution of the populations of spiders of terrestrial habits was homogeneous in a soybean crop seeded directly and these predators had a greater capacity to control pests at all points of the lot.",1

Abundance and species richness of overwintering staphylinids significantly increased with successional age of the wildflower areas and were always higher in older wildflower areas than in winter wheat. A similar but less distinct pattern was observed for the abundance and species richness of carabid beetles. The influence of habitat parameters (vegetation cover, fine sand content, organic matter, pH, soil pore volume, surrounding landscape structure, habitat area) on the staphylinid and carabid assemblages based on the number of individuals per species and site was analysed using canonical correspondence analysis. Vegetation cover was the most significant parameter significantly characterizing both staphylinid and carabid assemblages. The amount of vegetation cover explained 15.7% of the variance, fine sand content accounted for 13.3% and surrounding landscape structure for 10.9% of the variance in the staphylinid assemblage. In the carabid assemblage, vegetation cover was the only significant factor, explaining 24.7% of the variance. This study showed for the first time that the significance of wildflower areas as a reservoir for hibernation for generalist predatory beetles increases with progressing successional age.",1

Rape pests which are known to populate the fields from the edges might be augmented by sown weed strips. To evaluate whether weed strips have a negative impact on rape crop, insect pests and their antagonists were studied in a winter rape field near Berne, Switzerland, divided into two parts by a sown weed strip. They were registered at different distances from the weed strip and from the opposite field boundary in 1993. The pollen beetle Meligethes sp. and the cabbage weevils Ceutorhynchus assimilis Payk., C. napi Gyll. and C. pallidactylus Marsh and the brassica pod midge Dasineura brassicae Winn. were significantly more frequent near the field boundary than in the middle of the field and close to the sown weed strip. This could be because a sown weed strip does not act as a real field edge. For the investigated rape pods, little difference was observed as to the rate of infestation of C. assimilis. It was astonishing that only a few predators were caught by sweep netting in the whole field as well as close to the weed strip. A higher number of parasitoids near the sown weed strip could not be found either, which was probably due to their high mobility. The low rate of parasitization of the rape pests was only once assessed clearly higher near the weed strip than in the rest of the field. Therefore, flower visiting predators and parasitoids might not have been efficiently increased the weed strip. Generally, no negative impact of the weed strip on rape crop was found and therefore sown weed strips could be suitable areas in a farming with crop rotation to diversity an agroecosystem.",1

Functioning of a BZ depends on soil structure, as it is important for water infiltration. Therefore, it is vital to understand how varying management practices affect soils of BZs. We studied the structural and hydraulic properties of three differently managed BZs established in a boreal Vertic Stagnic Cambisol (clay, 51%). The three management practices for vegetation were as follows: natural with no treatment, harvested yearly and grazed by cattle. We used bulk density and macroporosity, together with a pore geometry index (air permeability per unit air-filled porosity), to describe the soil structural properties. Hydraulic properties were measured at different length scales by means of an aggregate sorptivity test, saturated hydraulic conductivity of the core samples and field-saturated hydraulic conductivity. Vegetation management markedly affected the physical properties in the top 5 cm of the soil. Properties were least favourable for infiltration at the grazed site, with the greatest bulk density, least macroporosity and hydraulic conductivity or greatest pore tortuosity. In general, spatial variation in zones with restricted and good hydraulic conductivity together with reduced aggregate sorptivity in the deeper horizons made the soil prone to preferential flow when initially dry. Prolonged wetness, on the other hand, reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity significantly, resulting in surface run-off. Harvesting was considered the best management practice due to its inherent capacity for reducing the soil nutrient content and because it has minor implications for soil physical properties.",0

We measured surface runoff volumes and nutrient concentrations and loads in a riparian buffer system consisting of (moving down slope from the field) a grass strip, a managed forest, and an unmanaged forest. The managed forest consisted of sections of clear-cut, thinned, and mature forest. The mature forest had significantly lower flow-weighted concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, total Kjeldahl N (TKN), sediment TKN, total N (nitrate + TKN), dissolved molybdate reactive P (DMRP), total P, and chloride. The average buffer represented the conditions along a stream reach with a buffer system in different stages of growth. Compared with the field output, flow-weighted concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, DMRP, and total P decreased significantly within the buffer and flow-weighted concentrations of TKN, total N, and chloride increased significantly within the buffer. All loads decreased significantly from the field to the middle of the buffer, but most loads increased from the middle of the buffer to the sampling point nearest the stream because surface runoff volume increased near the stream. The largest percentage reduction of the incoming nutrient load (at least 65% for all nutrient forms) took place in the grass buffer zone because of the large decrease (68%) in flow. The average buffer reduced loadings for all nutrient species, from 27% for TKN to 63% for sediment P. The managed forest and grass buffer combined was an effective buffer system.",0

In September 2000 we released groups of bobwhites into 9 buffer strip (treatment) areas and 9 non-buffer strip (control) areas among 11 agricultural farms. Each group consisted of 4 radiomarked bobwhites and 26 non-radiomarked bobwhites. To maintain contact with the established coveys, additional radiomarked bobwhites (n 177) were introduced into the coveys as radiomarked birds died. Survival for bobwhites released in buffer strip areas was lower (P 0.001) than survival in non-buffer strip areas. None of the radiomarked bobwhites released in the buffer strip areas survived past 27 weeks, whereas 11% of radiomarked bobwhites in non-buffer strip areas survived to 27 weeks and 1 bird survived to 41 weeks. Predation was the primary mortality factor (88%), followed by unknown causes (7%), stress (2%), hunting (2%), and road kill (1%). Mean fall and winter home range (95% minimum convex polygon) for 21 bobwhite coveys was 24.2 3.5 ha, ranging from 1.7 to 65.8 ha. Home range areas of bobwhite coveys in buffer strips (n 12, x 15.0 2.7 ha) was significantly smaller (P 0.002) than non-buffer strip coveys (n 9, x 36.4 4.9 ha). We conclude that the smaller home ranges in buffer strip areas seem to indicate better habitat quality; however, high mortality rates of pen-raised bobwhites limited our ability to confirm this.

The objective of this study was to investigate the temporal evolution of dissolved atrazine, metolachlor, and deethylatrazine (DEA) concentrations as well as the DEA to atrazine ratio (DAR) values in runoff from grass filter strips for the first (four to five) rain events occurring after annual herbicide application over four seasons (1998 to 2001) under natural rain conditions. The 16 plots (65 m long by 3 m wide [213 ft long by 10 ft wide]) were laid in a completely randomized block design with four treatments: 0 m filter strip and grass filter strips of 3, 6, or 9 m (10, 20, or 30 ft). The soil texture was 42% silt, 38% sand, and 20% clay with 3.1% of organic matter; the pH was 6.3; and the slope was 2% to 3%. Runoff-generating plots were left bare in order to maximize runoff. The strips were composed of 45% creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra L.), 45% bent grass (Agrostis alba L.), and 10% perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Grass filter strips reduced exported dissolved herbicide concentrations at least by half for the first two rainfalls of each study year. By the end of the sampling period for each season, dissolved concentrations for grass filter strips were most of the time, except for metolachlor in the 6 m grass strip in 1999, less than the criteria for the protection of aquatic life (chronic) (7.8 μg L−1 [7.8 ppb] for metolachlor (provisory) and 1.8 μg L−1 [1.8 ppb] for atrazine), which was not the case with the 0 m strip. Grass filter strips reduced the frequency at which these criteria were exceeded. Generally, exported dissolved herbicide concentrations decreased with time except when a rain event of high intensity occurred. DAR values never exceeded 0.66 and generally showed an increasing trend with time during the sampling periods of 1998 to 2000. Grass filter strips are an efficient mitigation measure against the risk of contamination of surface waters by atrazine and metolachlor.",0

The Island has one of the highest percentages of land (about 48%) devoted to crop production and pasture in all of Canada. Therefore, identifying the landscape elements that can mitigate the effects of habitat fragmentation resulting from agricultural practices is essential to preserve the biodiversity of Prince Edward Island. We quantified species richness, abundance and diversity of small mammals in 13 hedgerows and 13 attached forest patches. Although all the species detected in forest patches were also found in hedgerows, significant differences in species diversity and abundance suggest that not all species benefit equally from hedgerows. The abundance of small mammals other than the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) increased in hedgerows longer than about 225–250 m, but was independent of hedgerow's length in hedgerows smaller than 225–250 m.

Invertebrates were most abundant in hedgerows and adjacent vegetation during the summer when the diet of the Dunnock was largely insectivorous. Beetles (Coleoptera) were the main taxa in the diet, with weevils (Curculionidae) and rove beetles (Staphylinidae) predominating. Arachnids were important, and snails (Gastropoda), earthworms (Oligochaeta), springtails (Collembola) and flies (Diptera) were taken. Seeds were available in the study area from July and featured in the diet from August to April. Nettle Urtica dioica comprised the main seed in the diet. Other important seeds included Yorkshire fog Holcus lanatus, elder Sambucus nigra and dock Rumex obtusifolius. Stomach stones were most common in the faeces in winter. The Dunnocks were predominantly ground feeders and mainly used a hop-picking technique. Some seeds and invertebrates were picked directly off plants by Dunnocks above the ground. Most feeding occurred in hedgerows, which formed a small proportion of the study area. Overgrown hedgerows were the most important of the five hedgerow types. Nettle patches were an important feeding habitat. Dunnocks usually foraged alone or in pairs and rarely fed in association with other bird species. The highest proportion of time spent feeding was in January and the lowest in May.",0

Passerine birds were surveyed during the breeding season in hedgerows on 46 farms in lowland England. The incidence of each species was recorded in 50-m lengths of hedgerow and various attributes of these hedgerow sections were also recorded. 2. Logistic regression models were fitted to the data to describe the effects on the incidence of 18 bird species of the number of trees, hedge height and width, dominant plant species in the woody hedge, under the hedge and adjacent to the hedge in the uncultivated strip, the number of woody species in a standard length and other hedgerow characteristics. The effects of adjacent land use and cropping, reduced use of pesticides on cereal field edges and the geographical location of the study farms were also included in the models. 3. Most bird species preferred tall hedges with many trees, but there were some (dunnock, willow warbler and lesser whitethroat) which preferred tall hedges with few trees and others (whitethroat, linnet, yellowhammer) which preferred short hedges with few trees. 4. The differences among bird species in response to a sevenfold reduction in the height of hedges estimated from the models showed good agreement with the variation among species in the effects of severe hedge cutting on bird populations at one farm observed in an independent study. 5. The incidence of six bird species was positively influenced by the number of woody species in a standard length of hedgerow. 6. The incidence of two bird species was significantly affected by the identity of the dominant woody plant species in the hedge and one species by the identity of the dominant plant species at the base of the hedge. 7. Land use adjacent to the hedgerow, categorized as grass, tillage and roadside, had a significant influence on the incidence of five species. However, there was no evidence of consistency among species in the direction of effects. 8. The crops grown on tilled land adjacent to the hedgerow had a significant influence on the incidence of the blackbird. There was a significant degree of consistency among bird species in the ranking of crops, with oil-seed rape the most preferred and spring-sown cereal the least preferred. 9. The incidence of greenfinch, robin and song thrush was significantly lower in hedgerows adjacent to autumn-sown cereals which had received reduced levels of spraying of pesticides than in those adjacent to autumn-sown cereals which were fully sprayed. Most of the other species showed non-significant differences in the same direction. Most of the species studied also showed a non-significant tendency towards higher incidence in hedgerows adjacent to spring-sown cereals with reduced spraying than in those adjacent to fully sprayed spring-sown cereals.",0

The objective of this study was to estimate the effects of conservation practices on hydraulic properties and root-zone water dynamics of the soil. A 3-year experiment was performed on a slope at Xianning. Four treatments were evaluated for their ability to reduce soil erosion and improve soil water conditions. Compared with no practices (CK) and living grass strips (GS), the application of polyacrylamide (PAM) significantly reduced soil crust formation during intense rainfall, whereas rice straw mulching (SM) completely abolished soil crust formation. The SM and PAM treatments improved soil water-stable aggregates, with a redistribution of micro-aggregates into macro-aggregates. PAM and SM significantly increased the soil water-holding capacity. These practices mitigated the degradation of the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) during intense rainfalls. These methods increased soil water storage but with limited effects during heavy rainfalls in the wet period. In contrast, during the dry period, SM had the highest soil water storage, followed by PAM and CK. Grass strips had the lowest soil water storage because of the water uptake during the vigorous grass growth. A slight decline in the soil moisture resulted in a significant decrease in the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (Ku) of the topsoil. Therefore, the hydraulic conductivity in the field is governed by soil moisture, and the remaining soil moisture is more important than improving soil properties to resist short-term droughts. As a result, SM is the most effective management practice when compared with PAM and GS, although they all protect the soil hydraulic properties during wet periods. These results suggest that mulching is the best strategy for water management in erosion-threatened and drought-threatened red soils. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",1

The effect of field margins on the yield of sugar beet, wheat and barley was studied on commercial farms and in a series of field experiments from 1992–1997. There was always a trend of increasing yield from the edge of the field to the centre, with a marked reduction around the ‘tramlines’ and the area where machinery turns. In the studies on commercial farms, headland yield loss varied widely. In sugar beet the headlands yielded 19–41% less than the centre, with a mean reduction of 26%. In cereals the range was 3–19%, with a mean loss of 7%. Headland yield reductions were generally smaller in the field experiments than those found on commercial farms. These headland effects did not move towards the centre of the field when grass margins were planted at the edge of the field; there was no significant effect on the yield of the adjacent crop. The presence of boundary trees had the greatest effect on yield: in the outer 9 m of the field, the area shaded by trees produced 4.4 t ha-1 of wheat, and the area that was not shaded 8.1 t ha-1. Turning of machinery also significantly reduced yield, while grazing by rabbits and hares surprisingly had no effect.



Following the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in 1992, the main effect of which was to change from a price support policy to direct payments to producers, farmers in the European Union who produce more than a specified tonnage of ‘eligible crops’ per year, are required to fallow a given percentage of their land (currently 5%), to qualify for Arable Area Payments. Growers can elect to fallow fields on a rotational basis, or permanently. Headland set-aside is a term used to describe strips of set-aside, a minimum of 20 m wide around the edges of fields. In these experiments, the headland effect did not extend beyond 20 m from the field edge. Therefore, particularly in fields with boundary hedges or trees, headland set-aside could effectively remove the poor-yielding area at the field margin.",0

Its most common parasitoid is Copidosoma aretas (Walker) (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea: Encyrtidae). To identify selective flowering plants that could be used to increase functional biodiversity, the longevity of C. aretas and its host A. comariana was assessed on 5 flowering species: buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum Moench (Caryophyllales: Polygonaceae); borage, Borago officinalis L. (Boraginaceae); strawberry, Fragaria x ananassa Duchesne (Rosales: Rosaceae); phacelia, Phacelia tanacetifolia Bentham (Boraginaceae); and dill, Anethum graveolens L. (Apiales: Apiaceae). Dill was only tested with C. aretas. Sucrose and pollen served as positive controls, and pure water as a negative control. In a subsequent field experiment, A. comariana larval density was assessed at 1, 6, and 11 m distances from buckwheat flower strips in 3 fields. The proportion of field-collected larvae that were parasitized by C. aretas or fungi was assessed. Among the tested floral diets, buckwheat was superior for C. aretas, increasing its longevity by 1.4 times compared to water. Although buckwheat also increased longevity of A. comariana, its longevity and survival on buckwheat, borage, and strawberry was not significantly different, so buckwheat was chosen for field experiments. A. comariana densities in the 3 fields with sown buckwheat flower strips were 0.5, 4.0, and 8.3 larvae per m per row of strawberry respectively. Of the collected larvae, a total of 1%, 39%, and 65% were parasitized by C. aretas, respectively. The density of A. comariana and the proportion parasitized by C. aretas were highly significantly correlated. Distance from floral strips had no significant effect on either A. comariana larval density or on the proportion of individuals parasitized by C. aretas. Few other parasitoids emerged from collected larvae, and no larvae were infected by entomopathogenic fungi. Still, total A. comariana mortality was significantly affected by distance to flower strips, with the highest mortality near the flower strips. As no effect of buckwheat flower strips on C. aretas parasitism was found, the positive effect they had on A. comariana control stems from unknown mortality factors.

Loss of hedgerows can produce changes in environmental conditions that can be especially critical in summer, corresponding with the dry period in Mediterranean ecosystems. In order to show the effects of hedgerow removal on summer Mediterranean environmental conditions in rural landscapes, this paper describes a comparison of some key environmental conditions between areas where hedgerows are still present, compared to areas where they have been removed. Through a two-way ANOVA, it was found that temperatures in the hedgerows were significantly different from those in the fields, whilst air temperatures beneath the hedgerows were lower, and steadier, than those of surrounding areas. When temperatures of the fields were compared to those sites where hedgerows had been removed, significant differences in temperatures were detected belowground and sometimes at soil surface level but not at higher levels. The levels of soil water content and organic carbon were higher where hedgerows were still in place. These differences indicate potentially negative environmental impacts due to hedgerow removal. The implications of hedgerow conservation for environmental protection and for cropland productivity are discussed.",0

The Bocage in the western part of Europe is an ancient rural landscape characterized by a network of hedgerows. The system studied here consists of hedges growing on earth and stone banks, which are found in the Armorican Massif (western France). Seven sites were analysed, which represented a large, but not complete, set of situations. We investigated the influence of hedges parallel to contour lines on soil characteristics, soil profile morphology and carbon storage at the hillslope scale. The analysis is based on a morphological description of the soil catena from the top of the hill to downslope of the hedge, and on measurements of bulk density and organic carbon in different soil profiles on the slopes. The results show that thickness of the organic horizon increases slowly from the top of the hill as far as the hedge, whereas under the hedge the bulk density is low and the soil organic carbon (SOC) storage large. Two effects of the hedges on SOC storage are apparent, namely, a local effect under the hedge, due to tree activity, and an anti-erosive effect at the hillslope scale. A rough approximation based on these data assessed the fraction of SOC storage attributed to the hedge network of between 13 and 38% of the total carbon stock.",0

Agricultural intensification and expansion are regarded as major causes of worldwide declines in biodiversity during the last century. Agri-environment schemes (AES) have been introduced in many countries as an attempt to counteract the negative effects of intensive agriculture by providing financial incentives for farmers to adopt environmentally-sensitive agricultural practices. 2. We surveyed 18 pairs of AES and conventionally-managed farms in central Scotland (United Kingdom) to evaluate the effects of specific AES management prescriptions (field margins, hedgerows, species-rich grasslands and water margins) on farmland moths. We also measured the influence of the surrounding landscape on moth populations at three spatial scales (250 m, 500 m and 1 km radii from each trapping site) to assess at which scale management was most important for the conservation of farmland moths. 3. In general, percentage cover of rough grassland and scrub within 250 m of the trapping site was the most important landscape predictor for both micro- and macromoth abundance and macromoth species richness, although negative effects of urbanization were found at wider scales (within 1 km), particularly for macromoth species richness. 4. The abundance and species richness of micromoths was significantly higher within field margins and species-rich grasslands under AES management in comparison to their conventional counterparts, whereas AES water margins increased micromoth abundance, but not species richness. AES species-rich grasslands and water margins were associated with an increased macromoth abundance and species richness, and macromoths considered 'widespread but rapidly declining' also gained some benefits from these two AES prescriptions. In contrast, hedgerows under AES management enhanced neither micromoth nor macromoth populations. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings indicate that increasing the percentage cover of semi-natural environment at a local scale (e.g. within 250 m) benefits both micro- and macromoth populations, and that the implementation of simple AES management prescriptions applied to relatively small areas can increase the species richness and abundance of moth populations in agricultural environments. © 2010 The Authors.

Riparian restoration has been occurring in New Zealand for over 30 years in an effort to minimize this impact, however, little monitoring of restoration effectiveness has been undertaken. This study evaluated the impact of riparian plantings on water quality of lowland streams in the Lake Ellesmere catchment. A paired-catchment design on four river reaches was used to compare restored riparian buffers with control sites upstream. Chemical water quality sampling was used in conjunction with a macroinvertebrate community assessment. Equivocal benefits of riparian restoration were observed, with improvements in some variables but not in others. Riparian restoration had a positive effect on water quality in terms of increasing dissolved oxygen and decreasing turbidity. However, conductivity increased at planted sites and no changes were observed in other variables. These findings may be affected by the insufficient width of all four buffers, and gaps in the buffer system contributing to poor water quality. Although variable responses were seen in invertebrate community composition, this research suggests that even narrow planted buffer strips may be effective in improving some water quality parameters. The overall mixed results present a fair assessment of the benefits of riparian restoration that may be expected within a relatively short time following vegetation establishment. Even when no baseline data have been established prior to restoration, this research showed monitoring can demonstrate the effectiveness of riparian restoration.",4

The main difference between blocks was that block A was cut across by a corridor composed of 65 flowering plant species which was connected to the surrounding riparian habitat, whereas block B had no plant corridor. In both years, leafhopper adults and nymphs and thrips tended to be more numerous in the middle rows of block A and less abundant in border rows close to the forest and corridor where predators were more abundant. The complex of predators circulating through the corridor moved to the adjacent vine rows and exerted a regulatory impact on herbivores present in such rows. In block B all insects were evenly distributed over the field, no obvious density gradient was detected from the edges into the center of the field. Although it is suspected that A. epos depended on food resources of the corridor, it did not display a gradient from this rich flowering area into the middle of the field. Likewise no differences in rates of egg parasitism of leafhoppers could be detected in vines near the corridor or in the vineyard center. The presence of riparian habitats enhanced predator colonization and abundance on adjacent vineyards, although this influence was limited by the distance to which natural enemies dispersed into the vineyard. However, the corridor amplified this influence by enhancing timely circulation and dispersal movement of predators into the center of the field.",0

Most of the management regimes involved varying the timing and frequency with which the field margins were cut. There was no evidence of consistent temporal trends in the abundance and species richness of Araneae on either the existing or expanded zones of the field margins during the first four years of the experiment. However, lowest numbers were recorded before expansion of the margins in 1987, and highest numbers in the final sample, in 1991. Araneae remained less abundant, and less species rich, on the newly expanded than on the existing zones of the field margins four years after they were ' set-aside'. Cutting reduced both abundance and species richness. Regimes which included cutting in mid-summer had a greater impact which persisted for longer than did those involving cutting in spring and autumn. Removal of cut material was associated with lower species richness than leaving it in situ. Sowing the margins with a wild flower seed mixture was associated with increased abundance and species richness of Araneae. Annual spraying with a broad-spectrum, non-persistent herbicide reduced the abundance of Araneae but the effect was not detectable until several months after the application of the spray. Both the species richness and abundance of Araneae were positively correlated with a measure of vegetation height made on the field margins in September, on both the pre-existing and newly expanded zones of the margins. The extent to which management practices which benefit Araneae are compatible with both the management requirements for various other taxa, and the overriding constraint of effective pernicious weed control on field margins, is discussed.",0

Half of the field was cultivated with minimum tillage (shallow tillage with a tine cultivator) and half was conventionally ploughed. Within each cultivation treatment there were different treatment areas (TAs). In the first year of the experiment, one TA was cultivated up and down the slope, one TA was cultivated on the contour, with a beetle bank acting as a vegetative barrier partway up the slope, and one had a mixed direction cultivation treatment, with cultivation and drilling conducted up and down the slope and all subsequent operations conducted on the contour. In the second year, this mixed treatment was replaced with contour cultivation.

Results showed no significant reduction in runoff, sediment losses or total phosphorus losses from minimum tillage when compared to the conventional plough treatment, but there were increased losses of total dissolved phosphorus with minimum tillage.

The mixed direction cultivation treatment increased surface runoff and losses of sediment and phosphorus. Increasing surface roughness with contour cultivation reduced surface runoff compared to up and down slope cultivation in both the plough and minimum tillage treatment areas, but this trend was not significant. Sediment and phosphorus losses in the contour cultivation treatment followed a very similar pattern to runoff. Combining contour cultivation with a vegetative barrier in the form of a beetle bank to reduce slope length resulted in a non-significant reduction in surface runoff, sediment and total phosphorus when compared to up and down slope cultivation, but there was a clear trend towards reduced losses. However, the addition of a beetle bank did not provide a significant reduction in runoff, sediment losses or total phosphorus losses when compared to contour cultivation, suggesting only a marginal additional benefit. The economic implications for farmers of the different treatment options are investigated in order to assess their suitability for implementation at a field scale.",0

Margins can also harbour plant species that are potentially injurious to the adjacent arable crop (undesirable species). Sowing perennial species in non-cropped buffer strips can reduce weed incidence, but limits the abundance of annuals with the potential to support wider biodiversity (desirable species). We investigated the responses of unsown plant species present in buffer strips established with three different seed mixes managed annually with three contrasting management regimes (cutting, sward scarification and selective graminicide). Sward scarification had the strongest influence on the unsown desirable (e.g. Sonchus spp.) and unsown pernicious (e.g. Elytrigia repens) species, and was generally associated with higher cover values of these species. However, abundances of several desirable weed species, in particular Poa annua, were not promoted by scarification. The treatments of cutting and graminicide tended to have negative impacts on the unsown species, except for Cirsium vulgare, which increased with graminicide application. Differences in unsown species cover between seed mixes were minimal, although the grass-only mix was more susceptible to establishment by C. vulgare and Galium aparine than the two grass and forb mixes. Annual scarification can enable desirable annuals and sown perennials to co-exist, however, this practice can also promote pernicious species, and so is unlikely to be widely adopted as a management tool in its current form.",0

In April 1992, weed strips were sown between tree rows and along the border parallel to the first and the last row of trees in one part (the other part served as control). In both parts of the orchard, randomly chosen trees were controlled visually in weekly intervals in 1992 and 1993. During flowering of weeds more aphidophagous predators were observed on the apple trees within the strip-sown area than in the control area.

The abundance and species richness of butterflies on expanded-width uncropped arable field edges, which were subject to 10 contrasting, experimental management regimes, were measured using transects in 1989, 1990 and 1991. The effects of the management regimes on a number of botanical variables, likely to be of importance to butterflies, were measured. 2. On the experimental field edges, butterfly abundance and species richness fluctuated between years and peaked at different times each year. 3. Butterfly abundance and species richness differed between experimental treatments. Plots which were either cut in the spring and autumn, or not cut at all, attracted more individuals and species of butterfly than did plots cut in the summer. Sowing with a grass and wild flower seed mixture increased butterfly abundance. Butterfly abundance declined on swards sprayed once annually with herbicide. 4. Mowing, sowing and spraying had significant effects on mean flower abundance, on the annual and perennial components flowering in the sward, and on the abundance of commonly used nectar sources and larval host-plants. 5. Stepwise multiple regression analyses on butterfly and plant data showed that the abundance of adults of most butterfly species was most closely associated with the abundance of flowers of key nectar source species. 6.

Buffer strips and managed intensive rotational grazing (MIRG) have been proposed to protect and restore stream ecosystems in Wisconsin. However, the ecological implications of a switch from traditional livestock management to MIRG or buffer strip establishment have not been investigated. Differences in small mammal communities associated with riparian areas on continuously grazed and MIRG pastures, as well as vegetative buffer strips adjacent to row crops, were investigated in southwestern Wisconsin during May–September 1997 and 1998. More species (mean of 6–7) were found on the buffer sites than on the pasture sites (mean of 2–5). Total small mammal abundance on buffer sites was greater than on the pastures as well; there were 3–5 times as many animals on the buffer sites compared to the pasture sites, depending on year. There were no differences in species richness or total abundance between MIRG and continuously grazed pastures in either year. Total small mammal abundance was greater near the stream than away from the stream, regardless of farm management practice but there were no differences in species richness. Buffer strips appear to support a particularly rich and abundant small mammal community. Although results did not detect a difference in small mammal use between pasture types, farm-wide implications of a conversion from continuous to MIRG styles of grazing may benefit small mammals indirectly by causing an increase in the prevalence of pasture in the agricultural landscape.",0

The work led us to the following conclusions: Honeydew of cabbage aphids enhances the survival of the hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus, and can be an important food source when the syrphids are searching within the crop for oviposition sites. Syrphids can only reproduce when pollen is available as well. Feeding on pollen and nectar during the pre-ovipositional period allows the females to produce eggs for a week thereafter, even when flowers are no longer available. This shows that they can store their food reserves for several days. Female syrphids probably focuses on flower foraging during the first week after emergence, before switching to searching for aphids and oviposition sites (in the crop). Thereafter, the syrphid will have to travel again between floral patches and aphid patches to maintain egg maturation. Cage experiments show that the syrphid E. balteatus can be an effective predator of cabbage aphids on Brussels sprouts. The resurgence of the cabbage aphids in autumn, when natural enemies such as syrphids virtually disappear, suggests that these natural enemies play an important role in keeping the aphids under control during summer. Syrphids are stimulated in the crop by the vicinity of flowering plants like buckwheat and cornflower. During summer the differences in syrphid densities were not reflected in aphid population levels. Possibly, natural enemies that are less dependent on floral resources, such as parasitoids, compensate for the small scale differences in syrphid predator density.",0

A paired-field study was made in southern England in arable fields, each with or without sown 6-m wide grass margin strips. Seven field pairs were located in each of small, intermediate and open landscapes, which were based on mean field size. Ground cover, plant species diversity and assemblages were assessed in crop centres, crop edges and non-crop field boundaries. The data were used to test for effects of sown grass margins, differences in field location, impacts on rare weed species and for landscape effects on weed assemblages. Significantly higher plant species diversity was found in boundaries protected by buffer strips. Annual weeds associated with field edges, notably Anisantha sterilis, were found at lower cover where perennial grass strips were present. Sown grass strips enhanced boundary plant diversity, particularly by increasing polycarpic species. Margin strips had a small influence on the weed flora of the crop edge, possibly reducing weed cover, but had no influence on floras of field centres. Field size and landscape context did not affect weed assemblages, which show marked field-to-field variability, though crop type was an important influence. Grass margins did not enhance rare arable weed species and may be a threat to them, if margins are sited where such species are known to occur in the seedbank. With this exception, grass strips are a positive influence on boundary flora diversity and reduce margin weeds in arable landscapes.",0

The influence of the amount and configuration of reconstructed prairie vegetation on the delivery of ecosystem services was investigated in several small catchments at Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge in Iowa. Treatments include catchments entirely in row crops under a no-till, corn-soybean (Zea mays L.-Glycine max [L.] Merrill) rotation, catchments with 10% of the land in prairie located at the base, and catchments with 10 or 20% of the land in multiple contour strips of prairie. During 2009 and 2011 growing seasons, we measured abundance and diversity of aphidophagous insect predators in response to treatment and habitat type (i.e., soybean, prairie). In 2011, we further studied the biological control of soybean aphids by artificially infesting uncaged and caged plants to prevent exposure from predators. While aphidophagous predators were more abundant in prairie, populations of key aphid predators did not significantly differ among treatments. Biological control of the soybean aphid did not differ among treatments or with distance from prairie. Our results suggest that prairie strips, in addition to providing soil and water quality benefits, may increase the populations of beneficial insects, but may not directly impact biocontrol.

To augment the density of the predators of aphids weed strips were sown in tramlines and along the border parallel to the first and the last row of trees in one half of the orchard (the other half served as control) in April 1992. Weekly visual observations, monthly beating-tray samples, branch samples in winter, and assessment of the density of spider webs and their trapping efficiency on randomly chosen trees were carried out in 1993. During 1993, significant differences in the number of aphids, aphidophagous insects, and spiders were observed on the apple trees within both the strip-managed area and the control area. The impact on aphids by the aphidophagous insects was important during the flowering time of weeds in spring and summer. In autumn, however, spiders (i.e. Araniella spp.) were the dominant predators of aphids on the trees ; during this time of the year they were more abundant within the strip-managed area of the orchard. With a higher density of webs, spiders significantly reduced the number of aphids able to return from their summer host plants. Consequently, less hatching aphids were found on branch samples of the strip-managed area compared to the control area. The effects of the weed strips on spiders and aphidophagous insects, and the resulting impact of predation on the aphids are discussed.",0

Primary aims are to develop understanding of the processes governing flood generation and the associated impacts of land management practices, and to bridge the gap between process understanding and ability to predict effects on downstream flooding. To achieve this, the experiment is designed to operate at plot (100 m2), hillslope (0·1 km2) and small catchment scale (10 km2). Hillslope-scale data, from an under-drained, agriculturally improved pasture, show that drain flow is a dominant runoff process. However, depending on antecedent moisture conditions, overland flow may exceed drain flow rates and can be an important contributor to peak flow runoff at the hillslope-scale. Flow, soil tension data and tracer tests confirm the importance of macropores and presence of perched water tables under normal wet conditions. Comparisons of pasture runoff with that from within a 10 year-old tree shelterbelt show significantly reduced overland flow due to the presence of trees and/or absence of sheep. Comparisons of soil hydraulic properties show significant increases in hydraulic conductivity and saturated moisture content of soil under trees compared to adjacent improved pasture.",0

               <jats:p>Understanding the factors that have an impact on the diversity of forage flora in the agricultural landscape is a key issue in the maintenance and control of food niches for pollinators. Field margins are common linear structures in the agricultural landscape. In the present study, we evaluated the factors that exert an impact on the forage flora composition and on the diversity in field margins. The study was conducted in the 2010 - 2011 time period across the agricultural landscape on the Lublin Upland of SE Poland. Data on the forage flora were obtained while making floristic charts along 45 transect plots x 300 m; the total length being 13500 m. Multivariate ordination techniques (PCA and RDA) were employed to analyse forage-flora characteristics. Field margins represent valuable refuge areas for forage-species richness, but not for the abundance of forage species. On field margins, forage-species diversity benefits from the location of natural habitats (forests or meadows), primarily if the distance from these habitats is &lt;1000 m or the field acreage is &lt;10 ha. The shift from heterogeneous habitats to a more homogeneous landscape causes a reduction of forage floral diversity. Due to lack of dense forage-species patches, the promotion of sowing nectariferous and/or polleniferous species seems to be a reasonable management method to enhance the quantitative food niche on field margins and to support the conservation of pollinators in the areas surrounding farms.</jats:p>",0

Field borders have been promoted as an important component of conservation plans to reverse this decline. Field border characteristics, such as shape and the landscapes in which the borders are established, have the potential to influence their effectiveness for recovering northern bobwhite populations. We established narrow linear (approx. 3-m-wide) and nonlinear field borders on farms in agriculture-dominated and forest-dominated landscapes in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, USA, after collecting pretreatment data on summer bobwhite abundance. After establishment of field borders, summer bobwhite abundance nearly doubled on farms in agriculture-dominated landscapes and increased approximately 57% on farms with nonlinear field borders. Summer bobwhite abundance did not increase on farms with linear field borders in forest-dominated landscapes. Nonlinear and narrow linear field borde...",0

Understanding the environmental factors that structure biodiversity and food webs among communities is central to assess and mitigate the impact of landscape changes. 2. Wildflower strips are ecological compensation areas established in farmland to increase pollination services and biological control of crop pests and to conserve insect diversity. They are arranged in networks in order to favour high species richness and abundance of the fauna. 3. We describe results from experimental wildflower strips in a fragmented agricultural landscape, comparing the importance of landscape, of spatial arrangement and of vegetation on the diversity and abundance of trap-nesting bees, wasps and their enemies, and the structure of their food webs. 4. The proportion of forest cover close to the wildflower strips and the landscape heterogeneity stood out as the most influential landscape elements, resulting in a more complex trap-nest community with higher abundance and richness of hosts, and with more links between species in the food webs and a higher diversity of interactions. We disentangled the underlying mechanisms for variation in these quantitative food web metrics. 5. We conclude that in order to increase the diversity and abundance of pollinators and biological control agents and to favour a potentially stable community of cavity-nesting hymenoptera in wildflower strips, more investment is needed in the conservation and establishment of forest habitats within agro-ecosystems, as a reservoir of beneficial insect populations.",1

However, there is increasing awareness that small improvements to the dominant landscape could potentially reap huge benefits to the populations of many of Britain‘s butterfly species. Recent studies have also stressed the importance of the landscape scale in the conservation of butterflies in small fragmented habitats. In this paper, we examine data from a variety of sources and conclude that the importance of shelter in open landscapes may be underestimated since recording is often restricted to the optimum conditions suggested by the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme. In less favourable conditions, butterflies may place greater reliance on those components of the landscape offering shelter. In light of the current policy of agricultural de-intensification we discuss how modifications to our current landscapes could benefit a wide range of species.",0

Although the importance of plant community assemblages in structuring invertebrate assemblages is well known, the role that architectural complexity plays is less well understood. In particular, direct empirical data for a range of invertebrate taxa showing how functional groups respond to plant architecture is largely absent from the literature.

2. The significance of sward architectural complexity in determining the species richness of predatory and phytophagous functional groups of spiders, beetles, and true bugs, sampled from 135 field margin plots over 2 years was tested. The present study compares the relative importance of sward architectural complexity to that of plant community assemblage.

3. Sward architectural complexity was found to be a determinant of species richness for all phytophagous and predatory functional groups. When individual species responses were investigated, 62.5% of the spider and beetle species, and 50.0% of the true bugs responded to sward architectural complexity.

4. Interactions between sward architectural complexity and plant community assemblage indicate that the number of invertebrate species supported by the plant community alone could be increased by modification of sward architecture. Management practices could therefore play a key role in diversifying the architectural structure of existing floral assemblages for the benefit of invertebrate assemblages.

5. The contrasting effects of sward architecture on invertebrate functional groups characterised by either direct (phytophagous species) or indirect (predatory species) dependence on plant communities is discussed. It is suggested that for phytophagous taxa, plant community assemblage alone is likely to be insufficient to ensure successful species colonisation or persistence without appropriate development of sward architecture.",0

Extensively managed field margins can help protect this functional biodiversity by providing habitat for beneficial species.

2. This 2 year study investigated the relative benefits of grassland field margin treatments (Fenced only, Rotavated, and Reseeded (with a grass and wildflower mixture)) on the abundance and taxon richness of five arthropod trophic groups (detritivores, herbivores, predators, parasitoids and hyperparasitoids) from the orders Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera and Araneae.

3. The taxon richness and abundance of all trophic groups (with the exception of herbivore abundance) was greater in fenced field margin treatments than in the adjacent grazed field, particularly by the final sampling occasion. However, there were seasonal differences, with abundance and taxon richness generally greater in August than in June. Only detritivores and herbivores responded to the individual fenced field margin treatments. The botanically more species rich, rotavated and reseeded treatments, had greater detritivore and herbivore richness and abundance than the fenced only treatments.

4. Community structure analysis indicated that the grazed (within) field and fenced field margins had two distinct communities for all trophic groups, demonstrating the conservation value of the margins within intensively managed agricultural grasslands.

5. The current Irish agri-environment scheme requires fencing of field margins. Our results highlight how this relatively simple measure can benefit arthropod conservation and functional biodiversity. This may in turn benefit farm productivity through potentially improved nutrient cycling and natural pest control.",0

We conducted a field-scale study to determine if habitat manipulations along the field edges of an organic crop rotation increase the activity-density of beneficial ground-dwelling invertebrates. Pitfall traps were used to collect micro and macro ground-dwelling organisms in nine organic crop fields (three each of maize, soybeans, and hay; 2.5-4.0 ha each) surrounded by four experimental habitat manipulations (planted native grass and prairie flowers, planted prairie flowers only, fallow vegetation, or mowed vegetation) during 2009 and 2010 in eastern North Carolina. Beneficial macro and micro invertebrates collected in these pitfall traps consisted primarily of Carabidae, Araneae, Collembola, and mite species. Results show that habitat manipulations had little effect on the activity-density of the dominant epigaeic invertebrates in our study system. Our results suggest that the activity-density of these organisms were instead determined by a combination of in-field characteristics, such as crop type, weed management practices, and within-field resources, along with the diversity of crop type in neighboring fields and the availability of other resources in the area.",0

In this study, we investigated whether or not landscape characteristics affected the number of codling moths in commercial orchards. To do this, we collected overwintering larvae in 2006 and 2007 in 76 orchards over a 70 km² area in southeastern France. We analysed variations in the number of larvae using correlation tests and linear models. As independent variables, we took both characteristics of focus orchards (pear vs. apple, organic vs. conventional orchards) and of their surrounding landscape (orchard density and hedgerow network attributes) into account in buffers with widths varying from 50 to 500 m. Although the codling moth is specialised on orchards, the number of codling moths was lower in orchards within a high orchard density area. There was some indication that this effect was mostly due to the density of conventional orchards and thus to the intensity of insecticide treatments. Conversely, we found no particular effect of abandoned or organic orchards. In 2006, the number of codling moths was also significantly lower in a focus orchard when the hedgerow network acted as a protection against the prevailing wind. Finally, major effects of landscape variables on the number of codling moths were observed for distances of less than 150 m from the focus orchards, suggesting that codling moth management should be organised over areas of about 16 ha.",0

Carabid assemblages were examined in a range of riparian zones in intensively managed grassland in Scotland. Carabids were monitored by pitfall trapping in riparian zones open to grazing, wide riparian buffer strips (>5 m wide), narrow boundary strips (<2 m wide) and adjacent fields in order to determine factors influencing carabid diversity and assemblage structure. While carabid diversity was greater in open riparian zones and narrow boundary strips when compared to the adjacent fields, it was actually poorer in wide riparian buffers when compared to open zones thus indicating wide buffers may actually be detrimental to carabid diversity. Carabid assemblages in wide riparian buffers were, however, more distinct from the adjacent field than narrow boundary strips or riparian zones open to grazing. Consequently, while the presence of wide riparian buffers may not promote carabid diversity within the actual buffer strips, by adding an additional habitat that supports a distinct carabid assemblage, riparian buffer strips may promote diversity at the landscape level. Carabid assemblage structure was driven by a combination of soil and vegetation characteristics in addition to physical attributes including distance from the watercourse and width of the strip. Only when we have a better understanding of the factors influencing biodiversity within riparian buffer strips can we start to formulate effective management prescriptions that fuse their dual function of pollution mitigation and biodiversity promotion.",0

Vegetation analysis and insect samplings were carried out in nine sites within an intensively farmed landscape in northern Italy. Plant species richness and the percentage of tree, shrub, and herb cover were determined by means of the phytosociological method of Braun-Blanquet. Landscape structural connectivity was measured as the total length of hedgerow network (LHN) in a radius of 500 m around the center of each sampling transect. Butterflies species richness and abundance were positively associated both to herb cover and to plant species richness, but responded negatively to tree and shrub cover. Shrub cover was strictly correlated to both species richness and activity density of carabids. The species richness of syrphids was positively influenced by herb cover and plant richness, whereas their abundance was dependent on ligneous vegetation and LHN. Rarefaction analysis revealed that sawfly sampling was not robust and no relationship could be drawn with either vegetation parameters or structural connectivity.

Here, we investigate the relationship between breeding bird density and species richness and the age of sown field margins, a widely used type of AES, in southwestern Switzerland. Territories of breeding birds were mapped on 67 field margins between 2004 and 2011. Territory densities (for eight species) and species richness were analysed in relation to age of the field margin. A general negative correlation between size of the field margin and territory density indicated that territory density was higher when the birds could forage in adjacent cultivated land. Territory densities and species richness increased up to an age of 4–6 years after sowing, depending on the species, and declined thereafter. The results suggest that the co-occurrence of newly sown margins and margins over 3 years old will have a positive effect on breeding bird densities and species diversity.",0

Summary

Buffer zones in arable land could promote biodiversity of agricultural areas. These are most often established with sown seed mixtures of grasses and herb species. We studied the impact of cutting management and the role of the seedbank on plant species diversity of a sown buffer strip. Two main hypotheses H1 were tested in this study: (i) sward cutting and removal have positive effects on plant species diversity in a buffer zone adjacent to a cultivated field and (ii) the buffer zone soil seedbank and adjacent grassland act as a species source for the managed buffer zone. After 5 years of management, the number of species was significantly higher and the litter coverage significantly lower in plots mown yearly with cuttings removed than in mown plots with the cuttings left or an uncut control. The abundance of Elymus repens was not affected by the cutting management. To reduce E. repens probably needs cutting more frequently than once per year. Cutting management did not reduce easily-soluble phosphorus in soils. For species colonisation, adjacent grassland played a more important role than the soil seedbank. We conclude that, in this study, the reduced litter cover, together with adjacent sources of species, resulted in the gradual increase in species diversity in the species-poor buffer habitat. This study took place in a single location and similar studies in additional locations would be helpful in assessing the generality of our results. On the evidence of this study, the contract periods of agri-environmental schemes should be longer than 5 years to ensure cutting does result in positive benefits for the management of biodiversity.",0

Declining populations of UK grassland flora and fauna have been attributed to intensification of agricultural management practices, including changes in cutting, fertilizer, grazing and drainage regimes. We aimed to develop field margin management practices that could reverse declines in intensively managed grassland biodiversity that would have application in the UK and Europe. Here we focus on one aspect of grassland biodiversity, the beetles. 2. In four intensively managed livestock farms in south-west England, 10-m wide field margins in existing grasslands were managed to create seven treatments of increasing sward architectural complexity. This was achieved through combinations of inorganic (NPK) fertilizer, cattle grazing, and timing and height of cutting. To examine the potential influence of complexity on faunal diversity, beetles were identified to species level from suction samples taken between 2003 and 2005, and their assemblage structure was related to margin management, floral assemblages and sward architecture. 3. Beetle abundance, and species richness and evenness were influenced by margin management treatment and its interaction with year. Correlations with sward architecture and the percentage cover of dominant forbs and grasses were also found. Functional groups of the beetles showed different responses to the management treatments. In particular, higher proportional abundances of seed/flower-feeding guilds were found in treatments not receiving NPK fertilizer. 4. The assemblage structure was shown to respond to margin management treatments, sward architecture and the percentage cover of dominant forbs and grasses. The most extensively managed treatments were characterized by distinct successional trajectories from the control treatment. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study provides management options suitable for use within agri-environment schemes intended to improve faunal diversity associated with intensively managed lowland grasslands. Field margins receiving either no management or a single July silage cut were shown to support greater abundances and species richness of beetles, although subtler modifications of conventional management may also be beneficial, for example the absence of NPK fertilizer while maintaining grazing and silage cutting systems.",0

Observations were conducted in the agricultural landscape of Western Volhynia with fields of different land use intensity (a large-scale farming system and small traditional arable fields). The total length of the studied structures was 4760 m and the following five categories of structures were distinguished: field road verges adjacent to large (1) and small fields (2), field margins between the patches of xerothermic grasslands as well as large (3) or small fields (4) and balks (5). The distribution and abundance of species mentioned above were recorded there. The survey showed that linear habitats are not suitable for all the studied species; margins between arable fields and grasslands were the most important habitats for both grassland and weed species. Factors responsible for their abundance and distribution along these margins included the following: type of farming system, exposure of the margin, and soil moisture. Grassland species occupied habitats adjacent to small traditional fields with other than southern exposure; weeds were more abundant in drier microhabitas.",0

Non-submerged, temporarily submerged, and always submerged, sites are considered in both winter and summer. It is shown that capacities for epuration are elevated for nitrate loads from the alluvial aquifer during the lateral transfer of water from agricultural land to the river through the riparian zone. About 30 m of groundwater flow under the riparian wood studied is sufficient to remove all nitrate. Denitrification rates up to 50 mg N2 per m2 per day were observed in the field, but a potential for more denitrification exists. The efficiency of the riparian woods as natural filters regulating nutrient transfers to the river deserves more consideration in river management.",0

They are currently produced under three management systems that involve different aspects of soil and pest management, productivity, and crop economy: organic, (integrated pest management-IPM), and conventional. Here, we studied how these systems affect the spiders, the natural enemies of olive grove pests, and performed a detailed analysis of their assemblage. The study was performed during one season in 18 olive groves in Andalusia, Spain, and included both ground-dwelling and canopy species. We found that the organic system supported a significantly higher level of abundance and diversity of canopy spiders than the IPM and conventional systems. Plowing had a negative effect on spider abundance and diversity. However, the presence of hedge vegetation had a positive effect on the spiders. The practices affected the guild structure differently, with some guilds supported by organic and others by IPM. It is suggested that sustainability (in terms of pest control) in olive grove agroecosystems may be obtained by maintaining hedge vegetation regardless of the management system.",1

Their effectiveness is partly limited by the availability of nectar and pollen for the adults. In this study we examined the suitability of flowers of ca. 30 plant species as food source for the common Episyrphus balteatus, both with choice tests and with non-choice survival tests. Many common field margin flowers appear to be unsuitable, as they do not allow the hoverflies to survive up to their reproductive age. The results can well be explained by flower morphology: only flowers with nectar available at a depth of less than 2 mm are suitable. Choice tests indicate that the hoverflies mainly select flowers with accessible nectar. Moreover, field studies showed that field margins with a higher proportion of flowers with accessible nectar attract higher numbers of zoophagous hoverflies. These results stress the importance of laboratory bioassays for selecting the right plants for functional field margins.",1

Its aims are to improve water quality, promote biodiversity, and increase awareness of catchment management. In this study, the effects of buffer strip installations and remediation of a large septic tank effluent were appraised by water physico-chemistry (suspended solids, NO3, NH4, soluble reactive P) and stream macroinvertebrate indices used by the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency. It was done during before and after interventions over an 8-yr period using a paired catchment approach. Because macroinvertebrate indices were previously shown to respond negatively to suspended solid concentrations in the study area, the installation of buffer strips along the headwaters was expected to improve macroinvertebrate scores. Although water quality (soluble reactive P, NH4) improved downstream of the septic tank effluent after remediation, there was no detectable change in macroinvertebrate scores. Buffer strip installations in the headwaters had no measurable effects (beyond possible weak trends) on water quality or macroinvertebrate scores. Either the buffer strips have so far been ineffective or ineffectiveness of assessment methods and sampling frequency and time lags in recovery prevent us detecting reliable effects. To explain and appreciate these constraints on measuring stream recovery, continuous capacity building with land managers and other stakeholders is essential; otherwise, the feasibility of undertaking sufficient management interventions is likely to be compromised and projects deemed unsuccessful.",1

This was significant because intensive swine farms in North Carolina are considered non-discharge operations, and riparian buffers with minimum widths of 7.6 m (25 ft) are the primary regulatory control on ground water export of nitrate from these operations. This study shows that such buffers are not always adequate to prevent discharge of concentrated nitrate in ground water from commercial swine farms in the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain, and that additional measures are required to ensure non-discharge conditions. The median delta15N-total N of liquids in site swine waste lagoons was +15.4 +/- 0.2% vs. atmospheric nitrogen. The median delta15N-NO3 values of shallow ground water beneath and adjacent to site sprayfields, a stream draining sprayfields, and waters up to 1.5 km downstream were + 15.3 +/- 0.2 to + 15.4 +/- 0.2%. Seasonal and spatial isotopic variations in lagoons and well waters were greatly homogenized during ground water transport and discharge to streams. Neither denitrification nor losses of ammonia during spraying significantly altered the bulk ground water delta15N signal being delivered to streams. The lagoons were sources of chloride and potassium enrichment, and shallow ground water showed strong correlation between nitrate N, potassium, and chloride. The 15N-enriched nitrate in ground water beneath swine waste sprayfields can thus be successfully traced during transport and discharge into nearby surface waters.",1

Tea yields in these hedgerow intercrops are determined by the balance between the positive (i.e., increased soil fertility) and negative (i.e., resource competition) effects of hedgerows. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to determine: (a) the net effect of six different hedgerow species (Calliandra calothyrsus Meissner, Senna [Cassia] spectabilis (DC.) H.

Tea yields, measured over one complete pruning cycle from October 1998 to September 2001, showed reductions relative to a sole tea crop under all hedgerow species except Euphatorium. The yield reductions ranged from 22 to 40%. Tea yields under Euphatorium showed increases up to 23% relative to the sole crop control. Addition of hedgerow prunings as mulch increased tea yields in all hedgerow intercrops. The yield increases ranged from 11 to 20%, with the highest being under Euphatorium. Tea yields showed a negative relationship (R2=0.38) with the pruned biomass of hedgerows. Limitation of environmental resources (e.g., water and light) and hedgerow characters which intensified resource competition (i.e., greater canopy lateral spread and height and greater root length densities, especially in the top soil layer) were responsible for observed tea yield reductions in hedgerow intercrops.",0

This management practice is also beneficial for controlling manure-borne pathogen transport to surface water. The objective of this work was to assess the VFS efficiency and evaluate the uncertainty in predicting the microbial pollutant removal from overland flow in VFS. We used the kinematic wave overland flow model as implemented in KINEROS2 coupled with the convective-dispersive overland transport model which accounts for the reversible attachment-detachment and surface straining of infiltrating bacteria. The model was successfully calibrated with experimental data obtained from a series of simulated rainfall experiments at vegetated and bare sandy loam and clay loam plots, where fecal coliforms were released from manure slurry applied on the top of the plots. The calibrated model was then used to assess the sensitivity of the VFS efficiency to the model parameters, rainfall duration, and intensity for a case study with a 6-m VFS placed at the edge of 200-m long field. The Monte Carlo simulations were also performed to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the VFS efficiency given the uncertainty in the model parameters and key inputs. The VFS efficiency was found to be <95% in 25%, <75% in 23%, and <25% in 20% of cases. Relatively long high-intensity rainfalls, low hydraulic conductivities, low net capillary drives of soil, and high soil moisture contents before rainfalls caused the partial failure of VFS to retain coliforms from the infiltration excess runoff.",1

The Neotropical Region has experienced large habitat transformations as a result of intensified agriculture. These changes have affected the populations of many species of birds in the Espinal ecoregion of Argentina. However, relationships between birds and agriculture in the neotropics are poorly known. We assessed the effects of crops and field margins in an area of agriculture typical for the Espinal ecoregion on the structure of the bird community, and we assessed the value of this habitat for species of conservation concern. Birds and vegetation were sampled in and along the margins of fields of soybean (the most widespread crop) and alfalfa. Twenty-five of the 41 species recorded—including all the species of conservation concern—were found almost exclusively in field margins; only five species occurred almost exclusively in within the fields. All other species were found in both margins and fields. Density, richness, and diversity were much greater on the margins than in the fields. Bird d...",0

One of the management options for this set-aside land was to leave it as an over-winter fallow with a naturally regenerated green cover. This study was designed to test whether such land was used by seed-eating bird species, populations of many of which have undergone recent severe declines. Five out of six declining species recorded in the study were found in significantly greater numbers on this habitat than would be expected if the birds were randomly distributed over the farmland landscape. The results of this study, covering a wide geographical area, reinforce previous findings of the importance of winter food sources, particularly over-winter stubble fields, to declining farmland seed-eaters. Proposed changes to the CAP under Agenda 2000 include the reduction of the obligatory set-aside rate to zero. These results sugges...",0

We compared aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages among stream segments within continuously grazed pastures, intensive rotationally grazed pastures, undisturbed grassy vegetative buffer strips, and undisturbed woody vegetative buffer strips. We collected macroinvertebrate and stream sedimentation data from four streams in each land use category in two consecutive years. In an attempt to account for inherent watershed variability among streams, we represented watershed condition with a sample collected upstream of each treatment reach. Watershed condition tended to have greater influence on macroinvertebrate measures than local riparian land use. However, local riparian land use influences were apparent if watershed condition was statistically accounted for with analysis of covariance. Stream reaches wi...",1

In areas without riparian vegetation, both instream algal production and seasonal low flows appeared to be major determinants of suspended solids, turbidity, and phosphorus concentrations. Peak levels of all parameters were reached during the summer when flows were reduced and benthic algal production was high. Similar summer peaks were reached in streams receiving major point inputs but peaks occurred downstream from the input. Instream organic production was less important in regulating water quality in areas with riparian vegetation and permanent flows. Concentrations of suspended solids remained relatively constant, while phosphorus and turbidity increased in association with leaf fall in autumn. Intermittent flow conditions in summer increased the importance of instream organic production in controlling water quality, even when riparian vegetation was present. Efforts to improve water quality in agricultural watersheds during base flow should emphasize maintenance of riparian vegetation and stable flow conditions.",0

Methods: We studied the vegetation of fields and field boundaries using 2 m × 2 m sample plots. We estimated the frequency of species in both habitat types, applied an MRPP test to analyse the vegetation composition of field boundaries with various combinations of landscape features (ditches, roads, tree and bush layers) illustrating this by DCA ordination, and used indicator species analysis to determine the characteristic species of each boundary type. Results: Ca. 45% of the flora of field boundaries comprised species found on agricultural land. Most typical species in fields – agrotolerants – were also the most common in field boundaries. The vegetation of road verges and grassy boundaries consisted mainly of disturbance-tolerant species. Woody boundaries were characterised by shade-tolerant and nitr...",1

The National Conservation Buffer Initiative has promoted the establishment of herbaceous field borders to restore wildlife benefits once provided by such habitat. We evaluated effects of native warm-season grass field border establishment and width on winter bird response. Narrow (approx. 8-m) field borders represented a marginal improvement to non-bordered margins that were cropped ditch to ditch, whereas wide (approx. 30-m) borders significantly enhanced total avian conservation value, abundance, species richness, and sparrow abundance compared to non- or narrow borders. Furthermore, presence of wide borders altered bird use of row-crop fields. We observed increased sparrow (Emberizidae) abundances in agricultural fields adjacent to wide borders, which likely resulted from enhanced waste grain foraging opportunities. Given these benefits to wintering farmland birds, we advocate the integration of herbaceous field border habitat in agricultural landscapes, particularly borders of enhanced width.",0
