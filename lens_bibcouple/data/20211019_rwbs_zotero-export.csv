Moore; Palmer Margaret, A.","Invertebrate Biodiversity in Agricultural and Urban Headwater Streams: Implications for Conservation and Management","Ecological Applications","","10510761","10.1890/04-1484","http://www.jstor.org/stable/4543427","The urbanization of agricultural lands is currently one of the dominant patterns of land use change in developed countries. In the United States and parts of Europe, this has led to the implementation of agricultural land preservation programs and riparian protection and replanting efforts along urban streams. The ecological benefits of such programs for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity have yet to be fully explored. We designed a study to investigate the patterns of stream macroinvertebrate community structure along a gradient of agriculture to urban development, and the patterns among urban streams that vary in the amount of intact riparian buffer. In 2001 and 2002, we sampled the 29 small headwater streams comprising the outlying tributaries of four watersheds just north of Washington, D.C., in Montgomery County, Maryland, USA. This region has had dramatic urban development over the last 50 years, yet significant efforts have been made to maintain riparian buffers and promote preservation of agricultural land. Macroinvertebrate richness was strongly related to land use, with agricultural streams exhibiting the highest macroinvertebrate diversity. Taxa richness was related negatively and linearly (no statistical threshold) to the amount of impervious surface cover. For the urban streams, there was a strong positive relationship between invertebrate diversity and riparian forest cover. Urban streams with high amounts of intact riparian forest exhibited biodiversity levels more comparable to less urban areas despite high amounts of impervious cover in their catchments. The agricultural headwater streams in this study were not only more diverse than the urban headwaters, but their levels of macroinvertebrate diversity were high compared to other published estimates for agricultural streams. These higher richness values may be due to widespread use of ""best management practices"" (BMPs), including no-till farming and the implementation of woody and herbaceous riparian buffers, which may alleviate many acute stressors caused by cultivation. These findings suggest that, if managed properly, the preservation of agricultural land from development may help conserve stream invertebrate biodiversity, and that maintenance of riparian forests even in highly urbanized watersheds may help alleviate ecological disturbances that might otherwise limit macroinvertebrate survival.","2005","2020-10-29 20:06:33","2021-10-05 16:53:13","","1169-1177","","","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We surveyed the vegetation of field boundaries in organic and non-organic farms, recorded the field boundary type and width. We characterized landscape structure around the vegetation plots (r=250m). We classified plant species into two ecological response groups: (1) common weeds and other species occurring frequently on agricultural land, i.e. 'agrotolerant species'(47 species), and (2) all other species intolerant to contemporary agricultural practices-so-called 'nature-value species' (190 species). We analysed the effect of organic farming, boundary type and landscape structure on the diversity of these two species groups. We found that field boundary type and landscape structure described most of the variation in species composition of these boundaries, while organic farming had little effect. However, the analysis of plant species diversity revealed that organic farming significantly supported the species richness of high nature-vaiue species by increasing species richness on average by two species on 4 m(2) plot, while the richness of agrotolerant species did not depend on farming type. Boundary type had a specific impact on species diversity-ditches enhanced the richness of nature-value species and suppressed agrotolerants; woody boundaries hosted only a few agrotolerant species and road verges increased the species richness of both species groups. The richness of nature-value species benefited from wider open boundaries, while narrow boundaries hosted more agrotolerant species. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Vegetation within the flowpath increases water infiltration and decreases water turbulence, thus enhancing pollutant removal by sedimentation within filter media and infiltration through the filter surface. Field experiments have been conducted to examine the efficiency of vegetated filter strips for phosphorus removal from cropland runoff with 20 filters with varying length (2 to 15 m), slope (2.3 and 5%), and vegetated cover, including bare-soil plots as control. Artificial runoff used in this study had an average phosphorus concentration of 2.37 mg L-1 and a sediment concentration of 2700 mg L-1. The average phosphorus trapping efficiency of all vegetated filters was 61% and ranged from 31% in a 2-m filter to 89% in a 15-m filter. Filter length has been found to be the predominant factor affecting P trapping in VFS. The rate of inflow, type of vegetation, and density of vegetation coverage had secondary influences on P removal. Short filters (2 and 5 m), which are somewhat effective in sediment removal, are much less effective in P removal. Increasing the filter length beyond 15 m is ineffective in enhancing sediment removal but is expected to further enhance P removal. Sediment deposition, infiltration, and plant adsorption are the primary mechanisms for phosphorus trapping in VFS.","2003","2020-10-29 20:06:35","2021-10-05 16:53:14","","613-619","","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the 2007-2009 breeding seasons, we located 387 nests in buffers of a northeast Mississippi agroecosystem. Dickcissel ( Spiza americana) and red-winged blackbird ( Agelaius phoeniceus) were the most common nesting species. Time since disturbance influenced nest densities of dickcissels and red-winged blackbirds; densities were lesser during the first growing season post-disturbance but increased during the second growing season post-burn. Nest densities for both species were least in buffers adjacent to woodland. Inclusion of disturbance did not improve models of dickcissel and red-winged blackbird nest survival, suggesting that disturbance influenced nesting density, but not nesting outcomes. Amount of grassland surrounding dickcissel nests was positively associated with nest survival, but confidence intervals included zero indicating effects were not strong. Although distance to nearest crop or developed edge were included in competing models of red-winged blackbird nest survival, their effects were negligible. Agricultural conservation buffers will best serve breeding grassland bird populations if they are established in areas with minimal woodland cover, maximize total grassland in the landscape, and are maintained with prescribed burning. These results will help characterize the contribution of agricultural conservation buffers in agroecosystems of the southeastern United States. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

This study compared and quantified thermal conductivity (lambda), thermal diffusivity (D), and volumetric heat capacity (C) of prairies (Tucker Prairie [TP] and Prairie Fork [PF]), conservation buffers (grass buffers [GB] and agroforestry buffers [AGF]), and corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation (COS) land uses in Missouri. Core and bulk soils were collected at 10-cm depth increments. Soil thermal properties and water characteristic curves were determined at 0, -33, -100, and -300 kPa pressures. Additionally, soil organic C (SOC) and bulk density (BD) were also determined. The results showed that SOC was negatively correlated with lambda and D and positively correlated with C. Significantly higher values of SOC and lower BD were observed for AGF, TP, GB, and PF than COS. Similarly, lambda and D were significantly higher and C was lower under COS than the prairies and conservation buffers. The results suggest that a greater amount of SOC decreases the thermal conductance due to the insulating characteristics of SOC and acts as a barrier to heat transport. Therefore, AGF, TP, GB, and PF had lower thermal conductance to deeper soil depths, which helps to conserve more moisture as well as assist in increasing the longevity of SOC in the soil matrix. Our results imply that buffers and perennial vegetation can help reduce heat flow by increasing the thermal capacity and thereby mitigating climate change.","2014","2020-10-29 20:06:36","2021-10-05 16:53:14","","1977-1986","","","78","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No-till farming systems are well known agricultural practices and are widely used in temperate areas. In that regard, different settings and widths of riparian buffer zones (12, 24, 36,48 and 60 m) with woody vegetation, shrubs or grasses were assessed. The methodology was comprised of the evaluation of a large number of experimental sites and the sampling was conducted after the first rain period and respective fertilizer applications. The results point to the fact that effectiveness is largely controlled by buffer zone width and vegetation type. Indeed, buffer zones with 60 m width composed of woody soils were more effective in phosphorus (99.9%) and nitrogen (99.9%) removal when compared to shrub (66.4% and 83.9%, respectively) or grass vegetation (52.9% and 61.6%, respectively) areas. Woody vegetation has deep rooting systems and woody soils have a higher content of organic matter when compared to grass and shrubs areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Diversification of this production system occurs by adding a spring sown plant such as sunflower into the strip rotation (diversified rotation). Converting idle wheat land to grassland adds to plant diversity. Wheat production in the North American Great Plains is of an impressive scale (for each field, possibly 10 or more strips of several kilometers in length), but plant diversity occurs, particularly in the western region where diversified rotations and idle wheat land conversion to grassland are becoming more common. The 'Enemies Hypothesis' predicts a greater number of polyphagous natural enemies of insects in areas of high plant diversity. This hypothesis appeared to be valid for the 'specialist' aphid parasitoids Diaeretiella rapae and Aphelinus albipodus that were released to control D. noxia. A. albipodus was often more abundant along edges of wheat and sunflower strips of the diversified rotation than along edges of wheat of the traditional rotation. D. rapae was less abundant and principally found on sunflower and wheat of the diversified rotation. Parasitoids were often found in grassland adjacent to wheat at levels similar to those of the diversified rotation. The abundance of five aphid species on wheat was low in both rotations, and aphids on sunflower did not pose a threat to wheat health. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Research was conducted in 2006 to 2008 to evaluate the size of cool season grass filters consisting primarily of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb) with some orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata L.) relative to drainage area size in reducing runoff sediment and phosphorus (P). The soil was Pohocco silt loam Typic Eutrochrepts with a median slope of 5.5 %. The grass filters occupying 1.1 and 4.3 % of the plot area were compared with no filter with four replications. The filters were planted in the V-shaped plot outlets which were 3.7x11.0 m in size. The filter effect on sediment and P concentration was determined from four natural runoff events when nearly all plots had runoff. Filter effect on runoff volume and contaminant load was determined using total runoff and composites of samples collected from 12 runoff events. Sediment concentration was reduced by 25 % with filters compared with no filter (from 1.10 to 1.47 gL(-1)), but P concentration was not affected. The 1.1 and 4.3 % filters, respectively, compared with having no grass filter, reduced: runoff volume by 54 and 79 %; sediment load by 67 and 84 % (357 to 58 kgha(-1)); total P load by 68 and 76 % (0.58 to 0.14 kgha(-1)); particulate P (PP) load by 66 and 82 % (0.39 to 0.07 kgha(-1)); and dissolved reactive P (DRP) load by 73 and 66 % (0.2 to 0.07 kgha(-1)), respectfully.

Multivariate (co-inertia) analysis was used to analyse relationships of habitat and landscape descriptive variables with rodent records. Two main ecological gradients were recognized according to statistical analysis. Relationships of species occurrence with environmental factors were interpreted according to their main life traits. The first ecological gradient clearly differentiated communities from hedges to those of grass-dominated linear banks. This first gradient was associated with the prevalence of forest versus grassland rodent species. This partitioning seems to reflect rather ecological requirements of species than competitive interactions. Small rodents diversity and abundance were inversely evolving along this gradient. The second factor influencing species assemblages was associated to landscape heterogeneity surrounding the permanent habitats. According to this second gradient, species seemed to be selected in relation to their ability to disperse and to use cultivated fields. Maximum diversity was generally observed in heterogeneous permanent habitats with mixed vegetation structure but hedges are important to produce biomass for predators.","2006","2020-10-29 20:06:39","2021-10-05 16:53:14","","449-461","","","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Field margins have considerable ecological significance in agriculture-dominated landscapes, but are affected by interaction with management practices in the margin and on adjoining land. This study investigated the time period over which changes in management practices best explains the occurrence of 40 plant species now commonly found in 311 field margins of Zone Atelier Armorique, Brittany, France. Five management practices were surveyed every year since 1995. Species occurrence was recorded in 2007, 2011 and 2013 and related by means of GLMMs to management practices over time, up to a maximum of 12 years, i.e., scores of field margins on the two first axes of correspondence analysis (CA) performed on management practices. Model selection using AIC criteria allowed us to identify the time period over which to consider management practices that best explain plant patterns. For one third of the common 40 plant species recorded, the time period over which to consider management practices was greater than one year. The rest of the species showed inconsistent patterns with high level of variability between 2007, 2011 and 2013. The time period tended to be longer for species with vegetative reproduction and for zoochorous species. Our results show that the long-term simultaneous monitoring of both vegetation and management practices is important to understand some ecological patterns that would be missed either in short-term studies or for studies that exclude management information. Our findings contribute to long-term strategies for management and conservation of field margins diversity by highlighting that different plant groups require management on particular timescales.

The Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra is considered a suitable indicator for the conservation value of farmland habitats, and has recently suffered strong declines throughout much of its European range. As a basis for targeted conservation measures, we investigated the habitat preferences of this species in north-eastern Germany by comparing the composition of male territories with randomly chosen control sites. A territory was defined as the area within a radius of 150 meters around the assumed centre of the territory, as the majority of nests is found within this radius. To assess food availability for nestlings, arthropod abundance within the most abundant land use types i.e. crop fields, fallows, grassland as well as within unploughed strips was investigated. In total we found 102 male Corn Bunting territories, which were mainly composed of crop fields (50%), grassland (28%), and fallows (12%). Territories compared with control sites were characterized by a lower proportion of crop fields, a higher proportion of fallows, more diverse land use types, more abundant field boundaries, unploughed strips, and tracks, and a higher availability of song posts. However, neither the number of larger (>= 1 cm), smaller (< 1 cm) or all arthropods differed significantly among analysed land use types i.e. crop fields, fallows, grassland, unploughed strips. Our study confirms the significance of habitat heterogeneity and especially of sites with sparse vegetation (fallows > 10%) and song posts (> 70 m 'linear song posts' or > 1 solitary post per ha) for the habitat selection of male Corn Buntings.

Hedgerow quality can be greatly affected either by over- or under-management. Neglect of hedgerows is an increasingly important issue as traditional management techniques such as hedgelaying become economically unviable. In the UK, funding for hedge management is available under agri-environment schemes but relatively little is known about how this impacts on wider biodiversity. We used a randomised block experiment to investigate how habitat structural change, arising from a range of techniques to rejuvenate hedgerows (including more economic/mechanised alternatives to traditional hedgelaying), affected invertebrate abundance and diversity. We combined digital image analysis with estimates of foliage biomass and quality to show which aspects of hedge structure were most affected by the rejuvenation treatments. All investigated aspects of habitat structure varied considerably with management type, though the abundance of herbivores and predators was affected primarily by foliage density. Detritivore abundance was most strongly correlated with variation in hedge gap size. The results suggest that habitat structure is an important organising force in invertebrate community interactions and that management technique may affect trophic groups differently. Specifically we find that alternative methods of hedgerow rejuvenation could support abundances of invertebrates comparable or even higher than traditional hedgelaying, with positive implications for the restoration of a larger area of hedgerow habitat on a limited budget. © 2015 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","2015","2020-10-29 20:06:42","2021-10-05 16:53:15","","443-451","","","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Water content in agroforestry and row crop areas at 5, 10, 20, and 40 cm depths were measured throughout the year. Quasi-steady infiltration rates were not different (P > 0.05) among the treatments. Agroforestry had lower soil water content than row crop areas (P < 0.05) during the growing season. Higher water content after the principal recharge event in the agroforestry treatment was attributed to better infiltration through the root system. Results show that agroforestry buffer strips reduce soil water content during critical times such as fallow periods, and increase water infiltration and water storage. Therefore, adoption of agroforestry buffer practices may reduce runoff and soil loss from watersheds in row crop management.","2009","2020-10-29 20:06:44","2021-10-05 16:53:15","","5-16","","","75","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To increase our understanding of how land use modifies the controls on N cycling, we quantified rates of 2 microbial N transformations in a total of 18 agricultural and urban streams (with and without riparian buffers) for 3 y to examine how riparian vegetation and land use influence sediment nitrification and denitrification. Nitrification rates were highest in agricultural streams in late spring. Nitrification was not related to streamwater NH4+ concentrations but was positively related to sediment C content (linear regression, r(2) = 0.72, p < 0.001). This result suggests that benthic decomposition provided NH4+ (via mineralization) to increase sediment nitrification. Denitrification rates did not differ among landuse types but were positively related to sediment C content and streamwater NO3- concentration (multiple linear regression, R-2 = 0.78, p < 0.001). Sediment C content, the primary predictor of denitrification rates, did not differ among land uses, but strearnwater NO3- concentration, the secondary predictor of denitrification rates, was highest in winter and in agricultural streams, indicating that land use and season were more important determinants of denitrification than coupled nitrification. Substrate availability (N and Q for N transformations generally did not differ between buffered and unbuffered streams within a similar landuse type, probably because of the confounding influence of tile drainage systems, which effectively decouple stream channels from their riparian zones. Land use influenced the delivery of the necessary substrates for N transformations but decreased the role of riparian zones in stream N cycling by simplifying the drainage network of headwater streams.","2008","2020-10-29 20:06:45","2021-10-05 16:53:15","","90-107","","","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In coastal Virginia, USA, runoff from tomato fields with plastic mulch was suspected of causing mortality of commercial hard clam larvae at a hatchery located downstream of farming operations. Concern about the putative impacts of this practice on local waters resulted in a collection of studies to: (1) determine the sensitivity of early life stages of bivalves to copper, a commonly used fungicide; (2) examine acute and chronic biological effects of runoff on tidal creeks; and (3) examine the efficacy of management practices designed to reduce the delivery of pesticides to adjacent creeks. Laboratory bioassays revealed that 48-h LC50 values for embryonic clams Mulinia lateralis and Mercenaria mercenaria were 38 and 20 μg/l, respectively. In situ bioassays with Palaemonetes pugio showed that pulsed toxic conditions sometimes occur downstream of some tomato farms in plastic mulch following rainfall events. Growth, mortality rates and bioaccumulation of copper and organic pesticides in oysters were not correlated with the use of plastic mulch in watersheds. Sediment bioassays indicated potential toxicity in sediment collected downstream of some tomato fields in plastic mulch, but the effects were not consistent between years. Closer examination of management practices on the farms suggests that controlling runoff can prevent toxic impacts. Elevated levels of crop protectants measured at the outflow of farm ponds suggested that they may do little to reduce loadings of some pesticides. However, forested buffer zones and ephemeral sedimentation basins appeared to be effective in reducing pesticide concentrations in runoff and pulsed toxicity in tidal creeks.

To better understand these processes, a runoff study was conducted to evaluate vegetated buffer strips performance in reducing atrazine, metolachlor, and chlorpyrifos transport as affected by the drainage area to buffer strip area ratio. The simulated runoff water mixed with pesticide-treated soil was distributed onto six vegetated buffer strips, each 1.52 m wide X 20.12 m long, located downslope of the inflow distribution tank in a well established vegetated grassed waterway. These strips provided for three replications of two inflow rates designated as ""drainage area/buffer strip area ratio treatments"" of 15:1 and 30:1. Infiltration for the 15:1 treatment averaged 38.8% of the inflow volume, whereas it averaged 30.4% for the 30:1 treatment. Sediment retention efficiencies averaged 90.1% and 86.8% for the 15:1 and 30:1 treatments, respectively. Concentrations of atrazine and metolachlor associated with sediment outflows from the strips were larger than their respective inflow concentrations, while the results were opposite for chlorpyrifos. Concentrations in runoff water for both atrazine and metolachlor in outflow from the strips were smaller than the inflow concentrations; again, the results were opposite for chlorpyrifos. The 15:1 treatment retained an average of 52.5% of the total input of atrazine, 54.4% of metolachlor, and 83.1% of chlorpyrifos. Corresponding numbers for the 30:1 treatment were 46.8% for atrazine, 48.1% for metolachlor, and 76.9% for chlorpyrifos. Analysis of variance using the randomized block design showed that differences of percent retention of pesticide between treatments were not significant for any of the three pesticides at the 10% significance level. A lack of significant difference indicates either a need for more than three replications and/or larger area ratio treatments to be studied. The results of this study indicate that a 30:1 area ratio buffer strip could perform equally as well as a 15:1 area ratio buffer strip.

Three herbicides (atrazine, metolachlor; and cyanazine) were applied to the source area in each spring. Six vegetative buffer strips, 1.52 m widex20.12 m long, were isolated with metal borders downslope of the source area in a well established bromegrass (Bromus inermis) waterway These strips provided for three replications of two drainage to buffer area ratio treatments of 15:1 and 30:1.

Herbicide retention by the buffer strips for the two treatments were not significantly different for the observed storm events. Herbicide concentrations in solution in outflow from the strips were less than the inflow concentrations for all the three herbicides. Infiltration was the key process for herbicide retention by the buffer strips, although there war some adsorption to in-place soil and/or vegetation. Metolachlor concentrations in sediment increased in outflow for the two treatments; however the opposite was true for atrazine and cyanazine. Herbicide retention by sediment deposition in the strip represented about 5% of the total herbicide retention by the buffer strips.

There are indications that small mammal populations in Europe are declining due to the intensification of agriculture. According to national legislation, farmers in Switzerland have to cultivate at least 7% of their land as ecological compensation areas and, thus, some alternative habitats that are possibly beneficial for small mammals have been created. In this study, we estimated the diversity and density of small mammals on two types of conventional farmland field types (artificial grassland and autumn-sown wheat) and three types of ecological compensation areas (wild-flower strips, herbaceous strips and low-intensity meadows) by use of capture-recapture in March, May and July 2003. The common vole Microtus arvalis was the most abundant and predominant species in all habitat types except in herbaceous strips, which harboured the highest diversity with six species caught. In March the density of small mammals was generally very low, but significantly higher in wild-flower (mainly due to common vole) and herbaceous strips than in the other habitat types. In wild-flower and herbaceous strips, densities increased strongly from March to May and in July. On autumn-sown wheat fields, a strong increase occurred only from May to July and was caused by common vole. On artificial grassland and lowintensity meadows, densities of small mammals (mainly common vole) increased only marginally with low-intensity meadows supporting slightly higher densities. Thus, habitats that were not mown each year supported the highest densities of small mammals. This demonstrates that ecological compensation areas, such as wild-flower and herbaceous strips, make up an important refuge for small mammals. They probably also have positive effects on populations of many predator species that depend on small mammals, particularly if a mosaic with mown surfaces is created.","2007","2020-10-29 20:06:48","2021-10-05 16:53:15","","150-158","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recent introduction of agri-environment schemes in the UK has resulted in the reinstatement of substantial areas of rough grassland which may be of benefit to small mammals and their avian predators. In this study mature grasslands provided by agri-environmental schemes (farm woodlands, permanent set-aside, 2 and 6m field margins) were compared to better understand which hold the greatest prey numbers and how new areas of grassland targeted at barn owl conservation should be created and managed. In all habitats apart from farm woodlands, small mammal numbers were positively associated with taller swards. This study suggests that areas cut every 2 or 3 years supported more individuals and species than areas cut annually, although this trend was only significant for common shrews. With the introduction of the new Environmental Stewardship scheme in 2005, our results suggest that the area of suitable foraging habitat for barn owls is likely to increase.

The relationship of the beetle assemblages to measurements of species numbers of field margin flora, sward husbandry, sward characteristics and physical attributes of the field margin itself was investigated. Contrary to expectations most species caught did not seem to be correlated to any measured variable. The majority of species trapped were present in both the hedge and fence field margins. However, a notable percentage (29.4) were present exclusively in the hedge margins, for example, Leistus fulvibarbis and Trechus obtusus.

Two of the fields were managed conventionally and two were managed organically. Plants and invertebrates were recorded on the margin plots over a 2 year period to test the influence of the different mixtures on the community assemblages. There was no difference in the seed bank of the different plot types, however the organically managed margins contained more unsown species than the conventionally managed margins.The simple mix plots had significantly fewer plant species than the other plots. The naturally regenerating plots had significantly lower grass cover and grass species diversity than the other plots. In the second year perennial grass and perennial forb cover increased in all mixtures. Both the cover and numbers of unsown species were reduced in the sown plots in the second year. Percentage cover and species richness of forbs were significantly higher in the complex grass with forbs and naturally regenerating plots.Auchenorrhyncha, Heteroptera and Araneae abundance were significantly correlated with plant species richness. Also, both plant species richness and total plant cover significantly influenced the Auchenorrhyncha community. Invertebrate abundance was greater in the organically managed plots than in the conventional ones, except larval Coleoptera.In the second year significantly more predatory Coleoptera species were trapped in the natural regeneration plots. Farming system and field crop type influenced the Coleoptera communities, phytophagous Coleopteran diversity being significantly correlated with plant diversity. Sowing field margins with a complex seed mixture with some forb species and managing the field with reduced inputs suppressed undesirable plant species and increased invertebrate abundance and diversity.A mixture containing forbs increased plant species richness and maximised heterogeneity of the margin, providing a more diverse habitat for invertebrates.

There were two treatments: in one treatment, weeds at the margins and inside the plots were regularly controlled by tillage; in the other treatment no weed control was done. Thrips and Orius were sampled by beating faba bean plants and weeds. Orius niger (Wolff) was the most abundant predatory insect species in faba bean and flowering weeds, with numbers of adults and nymphs significantly greater in plots with weedy margins than in weed-free plots. Flowering weeds did not contribute to the abundance of F. occidentalis on faba bean. Abundance of adults of Orius spp. did not coincide with the abundance of F. occidentalis on faba bean or weeds. There were significant negative associations for numbers of Orius spp. among faba bean and the weed species Lamium amplexicaule L. or Sinapis arvensis L.

Finally, faba bean and weeds may provide some benefits to predators, such as nectar, pollen, shelter and egg-laying sites rather than as sources of insect prey. Cultivation of faba bean could be useful for conservation and augmentation of beneficial insects, including Orius spp. Furthermore, field margins bearing flowering weeds such as S. arvensis and L amplexicaule should be protected against destructive management practices, because they host considerable numbers of the Orius species.","2010","2020-10-29 20:06:51","2021-10-05 16:53:16","","313-325","","","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we analyzed the effects of wildflower strips (WFS) at the field scale and in the landscape context on butterflies in a Swiss arable landscape. Three hypotheses were tested: (1) butterfly diversity and abundance are higher in WFS than in conventional fields; (2) butterfly diversity and abundance are enhanced by the amount, proximity and connectivity of WFS in the landscape context; (3) additional factors influence butterfly diversity and abundance according to individual site conditions and landscape context characteristics linked to other landscape elements. WFS had more species and individuals of butterflies than conventional habitats. However, promoted species were mainly generalists; few specialists were enhanced. The diversity of all butterflies and of generalists increased linearly with percent cover of WFS, reflecting an effect of restoration measures depending on the landscape context. The influence of proximity and connectivity of WFS were, however, not significant. The occurrence of specialists was conditioned by plant species richness, while the effect of WFS for overall diversity was affected by the amount of grassland in the surroundings. We conclude that to increase the effectiveness of biodiversity-orientated restoration measures, their implementation should be steered toward increasing the share of WFS in the landscape. However, the combination of WFS with additional restoration measures might be needed to halt the decline of specialist species.","2011","2020-10-29 20:06:52","2021-10-05 16:53:16","","500-508","","","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results showed that sown grass strips were high quality habitats for grasshoppers compared to grasslands. Farming practices influenced grasshopper densities in sown grass strips while landscape context affected more the species richness of grasshoppers. Sown mixture and cutting export option were the main factors driving grasshopper density. Mixtures composed of grasses without legumes were the best, as well as hay export compared to no export. Increased grasshopper species richness occurred in sown grass strips located in landscapes with low grassland field availability and high connectivity.

Sown margin strips are key features of agri-environmental schemes in European agricultural landscapes and have been shown to benefit grasshoppers depending on the initial sown seed mixture. Understanding the mechanisms by which the sown mixture impacts grasshoppers in sown margin strips is the aim of our study. Here, we investigated plant-grasshopper interactions in sown margin strips and the respective effects of plant identity and diversity on grasshoppers. We surveyed plants and grasshoppers in 44 sown margin strips located in Western France which were initially established with three sowing mixtures dominated, respectively, by alfalfa, Festuca rubra and Lolium perenne and Festuca arundinacea. Grasshopper species contrasted in their response to plant diversity and to the abundance of sown and non-sown plant species. Some grasshopper species were positively correlated with the abundance of grass and especially of a single sown plant species, F. rubra. In contrast, other grasshopper species benefited from high plant diversity likely due to their high degree of polyphagy. At the community level, these contrasted responses were translated into a positive linear relationship between grass cover and grasshopper abundance and into a quadratic relationship between plant diversity and grasshopper diversity or abundance. Since plant identity and diversity are driven by the initial sown mixture, our study suggests that by optimizing the seed mixture, it is possible to manage grasshopper diversity or abundance in sown margin strips.","2015","2020-10-29 20:06:54","2021-10-05 16:53:17","","333-346","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Outbreaks of the aphid in Ontario are often spotty in distribution, with some geographical areas affected severely and others with few or no aphid populations occurring in soybean for the duration of the season. A. glycines spend summers on soybean and overwinter on buckthorn, a shrub that is widespread in southern Ontario and is commonly found in agricultural hedgerows and at the margins of woodlots. A. glycines likely use both short distance migratory flights from buckthorn and longer distance dispersal flights in the search for acceptable summer hosts. This study aims to model colonization of soybean fields by A. glycines engaged in early-season migration from overwintering hosts. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was used to rank numerous competing linear and probit models using field parameters to predict aphid presence, colonization, and density. The variable that best modeled aphid density in soybean fields in the early season was the ratio of buckthorn density to field area, although dramatic differences in relationships between the parameters were observed between study years.

To determine the cost of the approaches, simple financial spreadsheet models were constructed at both farm and regional levels. Taking into account crop areas, crop rotation margins per hectare were calculated to reflect the costs of crop establishment, fertiliser and agro-chemical applications, harvesting, and the associated labour and machinery costs. Variable and operating costs associated with each mitigation option were then incorporated to demonstrate the impact on the relevant crop enterprise and crop rotation margins. These costs were then compared to runoff, sediment and phosphorus loss data obtained from monitoring hillslope-length scale field plots. Each of the mitigation options explored in this study had potential for reducing sediment and phosphorus losses from arable land under cereal crops. Sediment losses were reduced from between 9 kg ha(-1) to as much as 4780 kg ha(-1) with a corresponding reduction in phosphorus loss from 0.03 kg ha(-1) to 2.89 kg ha(-1). In percentage terms reductions of phosphorus were between 9% and 99%. Impacts on crop rotation margins also varied. Minimum tillage resulted in cost savings (up to 50 pound ha(-1)) whilst other options showed increased costs (up to 19 pound ha(-1) for straw residue incorporation). Overall, the results indicate that each of the options has potential for on-farm implementation. However, tramline management appeared to have the greatest potential for reducing runoff, sediment, and phosphorus losses from arable land (between 69% and 99%) and is likely to be considered cost-effective with only a small additional cost of 2-4 pound ha(-1), although further work is needed to evaluate alternative tramline management methods. Tramline management is also the only option not incorporated within current policy mechanisms associated with reducing soil erosion and phosphorus loss and in light of its potential is an approach that should be encouraged once further evidence is available.

There was no evidence of consistent temporal trends in the abundance and species richness of Araneae on either the existing or expanded zones of the field margins during the first four years of the experiment. However, lowest numbers were recorded before expansion of the margins in 1987, and highest numbers in the final sample, in 1991. Araneae remained less abundant, and less species rich, on the newly expanded than on the existing zones of the field margins four years after they were 'set-aside'. Cutting reduced both abundance and species richness. Regimes which included cutting in mid-summer had a greater impact which persisted for longer than did those involving cutting in spring and autumn. Removal of cut material was associated with lower species richness than leaving it in situ. Sowing the margins with a wild flower seed mixture was associated with increased abundance and species richness of Araneae, Annual spraying with a broad-spectrum, non-persistent herbicide reduced the abundance of Araneae but the effect was not detectable until several months after the application of the spray. Both the species richness and abundance of Araneae were positively correlated with a measure of vegetation height made on the field margins in September, on both the pre-existing and newly expanded zones of the margins. The extent to which management practices which benefit Araneae are compatible with both the management requirements for various other taxa, and the overriding constraint of effective pernicious weed control on field margins, is discussed.","1998","2020-10-29 20:06:56","2021-10-05 16:53:16","","74-86","","","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Agri-environment schemes (AES) are used extensively across Europe to address biodiversity declines in farmland. In England, Environmental Stewardship (ES) was introduced in 2005 to address the shortcomings of previous schemes, but as for schemes in other countries, assessments to date have revealed little evidence for national-scale biodiversity benefits. 2. Here, we assess the efficacy of ES in driving changes in national farmland bird populations over the period 20022010, using BTO/JNCC/RSPB Breeding Bird Survey data. We tested for associations between ES management options, grouped into categories reflecting intended biological effects (e.g. stubble), and species population growth rates, wherever benefits of management might be expected to occur. 3. We found strong evidence for positive effects of management that provides winter food resources (i.e. ES stubble and wild bird seed [WBS] crops) on population growth rates across multiple granivorous species, at three landscape scales. The results for management aiming to provide breeding season benefits (i.e. grassland, field margin and boundary [hedge, ditch] management) showed mixed patterns of positive and negative associations. 4. The results for stubble and WBS provide the first evidence for landscape-scale responses of biodiversity to AES management. The negative relationships identified may also show the importance of management context driving unforeseen predation or competition effects. 5. Synthesis and Applications. This study demonstrates that agri-environment scheme management has the potential to have national-scale effects on avian population growth rates, although our results suggest that some components of the scheme have had little effect on bird populations. Therefore, whilst this study provides the first proof-of-concept for broad-and-shallow scheme impacts on biodiversity, our results underline the importance of targeting towards population-limiting factors, here winter food resources. A combination of low uptake of key in-field options that provide winter seed and a failure to cover the late-winter period effectively explains the lack of national population responses. Such issues need to be addressed before schemes like Environmental Stewardship will achieve their goals. This study shows the value of feedback from monitoring for informing scheme design, through identifying problems and testing solutions.","2012","2020-10-29 20:06:56","2021-10-05 16:53:17","","871-882","","","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the South-Western France, the evolution of agricultural practices occurs in two opposite ways. On one hand, the intensification of agriculture leads to simplify the landscape by hedgerows removal, grasslands ploughing and drainage for corn cultivation. On the other hand, the decreasing numbers of cattle and sheep conduct the less fertile parts of the territory to evolve into fallow, These two processes are closely linked on a same territory and important interactions exist between intensive agricultural areas and semi-natural communities. To understand the importance of these interactions and their role in ecological stability of landscapes, we use passerine bird communities as an ecological indicator. We modelized the relationships between birds and landscape structure from 256 releves. Each releve includes a bird count point of 20 mn and a description of the landscape feature on the surrounding 6.25 ha. An ordination of the releves along the main ecological gradients was realized using Correspondence Analysis. Then, these ordinations where related to the landscape structure with Stepwise and Multiple Regression Analysis. The rate of woody area, the hedgerow network complexity and the rate of fallow land are the main ecological gradients. We have used this model to measure the importance of the changes induced on landscape by a range of management practices differing in intensity. To achieve this aim we compare the displacement of 116 releves along the ecological gradients between 1983 and 1988. The changes occurring both in bird composition and landscape structure reveal the ecological impacts of the different management practices (hedgerow removal, drainage, ploughing, decreasing grazing pressure). We examine the behaviour of ecological diversity of landscape units differing in structure and use.","1992","2020-10-29 20:06:57","2021-10-05 16:53:16","","195-211","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is the need to investigate their role in intensive farming systems where a realistic and shareable proposal to realize buffer strips can only foresee the use of a limited space. We evaluated the nitrogen buffering capacities of two narrow riparian strips (5–8m) along irrigation ditches located in a typical flat agricultural watershed of the alluvial plain of the River Po (Northern Italy). Subsurface water level and nutrient concentrations were monitored along transects of piezometers installed from crop fields to ditches in two different areas. Spatial and temporal variation in water chemistry and hydrology were investigated to individuate the main processes (biological or physical) leading to groundwater nitrate depletion related to fertilization, pluviometric regime and seasonal variation. The results obtained indicate an elevated nitrate removal efficiency in both riparian areas. Compared to the high mean concentrations measured at the exit of the crop fields (10–90mgl−1 N-NO3−), nitrate levels within riparian sites can be very low, completely disappearing below the ditches. The patterns of some chemical species (O2, SO42− and HCO3−) and the potential denitrification rates suggest that denitrification plays a predominant role in the N-NO3− depletion observed in the first few meters of the herbaceous strip. The key factors in the system are the elevated groundwater residence time and the effect of the evapotranspiration. The water uptake by woody vegetation affects the subsurface water to flow through the riparian zone and, at the same time, it contributes to completely remove the nitrate from the groundwater. Our findings also suggest the double role of riparian vegetation both in ecohydrological and biological terms. In fact the water uptake by trees affects the subsurface flow pattern and contributes to completely remove the nitrate in the riparian zone.

The most common species in orchards were: Omalium caesum, Dexiogyia corticina, Mocyta orbata, Coprochara bipustulata, Sphenoma abdominale, Drusilla canaliculata, Styloxys insecatus, Palporus nitidulus, Heterothops dissimilis, Mocyta fungi, Pella limbata, Pycnota vicina and Hemitropia sordida. The number of species was high in control plots without any insecticide application and less in integrated pest management plots, where selective insecticides were used. In the wheat fields a total of 798 individuals belonging to 20 species were collected. The most widely occurring species were: Staphylinus caesareus, Tachyporus hypnorum, Philonthus cognatus, Aloconota gregaria, Tachyporus chrysomelinus and T. obtusus. Although species from Tachyporus spp. were dominant in cumulative samples, the activity density decreased considerably for the second half of the vegetation period. The fields' structure and the treatments have a significant role in forming the dominance of species. Also the dynamics of each species is highly influenced by the disturbances. These could be explained with different microclimatic and humidity tolerance of the species. The greater mobility of staphylinids may enable them to avoid pesticide treatments in individual fields. These factors (natural weed cower, the presence of the hedgerows and the flying ability of the species) can interact and offer optimal possibilities for predation in agricultural fields.","2007","2020-10-29 20:06:58","2021-10-19 13:13:42","","67-74","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although coriander showed the capacity to self-pollinate, bagged umbels (no insect pollination) produced significantly less seeds than open-pollinated coriander umbels. In the vicinity of floral margins (mixed or monospecific), coriander plants were more frequently visited by pollinators than control plants (no margins), which consequently improved seed production and quality (seed weight and germination rate). Finally, the present study showed that the presence of both mixed and monospecific margins can improve the production of coriander seeds by more than 220% and, in addition, conserve local pollinators within agro-ecosystems.","2015","2020-10-29 20:06:59","2020-10-29 20:06:59","","302-308","","","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A total of 390 male and 373 female beetles was examined. Each female was dissected and the number of ripe eggs counted. The nutritional state was expressed by a condition factor, which was calculated for each individual based on the observed weight and elytra length of male and female P. cupreus. Carabids in the 1-year-old wildflower areas contained significantly less ripe eggs than those from the 4-year-old areas. The condition factor of female and male beetles was significantly lower in 1- than 2- to 4-year-old areas. We examined the influence of habitat parameters (vegetation cover, soil water content, coarse and fine sand, pore volume, habitat size and age, surrounding landscape structure) on the reproductive success and nutritional state of P. cupreus in the 16 wildflower areas. The number of eggs was best explained by habitat age, accounting for 53.4% of the variability. The variation in the condition factor of female and male beetles was best explained by habitat age, which accounted for 73% and 71% of the variation, respectively. Moreover, the beetles' reproductive potential and nutritional condition were significantly associated with vegetation cover, and occasionally also with soil water content. The potential of wildflower areas as a reservoir for the generalist predator P. cupreus was shown to increase with successional age.","2003","2020-10-29 20:07:00","2021-10-05 16:53:17","","","","","- 135","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4; - 48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, plant diversity in field boundaries has decreased substantially in recent decades. This pattern is generally linked with the intensification of agricultural land use at field and landscape level. Therefore, we aimed to test the effect of farming management (field and boundary management), boundary structure (width and habitat assemblage considering the Mediterranean grassland element), and landscape heterogeneity on plant species richness of field boundaries. Plants were recorded along 30 field boundaries next to organic fields and 30 next to conventional fields located in 15 agrarian localities of NE Iberian Peninsula along a gradient of landscape complexity. A total of 517 plant species were identified in the 60 field boundaries. We recorded 162 species (31%) catalogued as rare, very rare or extremely rare in the flora of the Catalan Countries. Our results showed the importance of landscape heterogeneity, field management and habitat assemblage, since they were found to be the most influential variables for plant species richness; whereas boundary width and boundary management were seen to contribute less to explaining plant diversity. Accordingly, agri-environmental schemes should be designed to promote organic farming and maintain the structure of the landscape mosaic in order to benefit plant diversity in field boundaries in the Mediterranean region.","2012","2020-10-29 20:07:02","2021-10-05 16:53:18","","1101-1114","","","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is little known how the interaction of these local variables (amount of hedges and organic management) with landscape scale variables affects birds. We selected paired conventional and organic winter wheat fields and meadows in each of 10 landscapes in Germany. Birds were surveyed in the fields and in the adjoining hedges. More bird species occurred in organic than in conventional fields regardless of land-use type (wheat fields and meadows). However, hedge length had a much stronger effect on bird richness than organic farmland management. We found an interaction of landscape complexity and hedge length in that hedge length enhanced bird richness only in case of simple landscapes (<17% semi-natural areas within a 500 m radius around the centre of bird survey plots). In more complex landscapes the local effect of hedge length levelled off because bird richness was high even without local hedges. Therefore, adding hedges or introducing organic farming practices should be primarily promoted in simple landscapes, where it really makes a difference for biodiversity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the impact of the hedgerow management regime encouraged for organic farms on small mammal populations, since small mammal numbers influence a range of species at higher trophic levels and, in particular, are key to the conservation of a range of mammalian and avian predators. We compared differences in management and structure of non-crop habitats at the farm-scale between organic and conventional farms, and used within-farm variations in hedgerow size to predict the effect of hedgerow size on small mammals on both farm types. There were no significant differences in the proportion of non-crop habitats between organic and conventional farms, although management differences produced larger hedgerows on organic farms and greater diversity of hedgerow growth stages. However, a difference in hedgerow size between the farm types did not have a significant effect on small mammal abundance or diversity. We conclude that increased hedgerow size is not benefiting small mammal populations on organic farms: significant gains in small mammal numbers may be more effectively achieved by increasing the area of non-crop habitats rather than by improving management regimes.

P. neoaphidis was able to infect the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, when maintained under controlled conditions that simulated those that occur seasonally in the UK. Although there was a significant inverse relationship between temperature and time-to-kill, with death occurring after 4.2, 6.9 and 13.6 days when maintained under fluctuating summer, autumn and winter temperatures, respectively, there were no additional statistically significant effects of photoperiod. The activity of inoculum on soil was indirectly assessed by baiting with A. pisum. Under controlled conditions P. neoaphidis remained active on soil and was able to infect aphids for up to 80 days. However, the percentage of aphids that became infected decreased from 76% on day 1 to 11% on day 80. Whereas there was little difference in the activity of conidia that had been maintained at 4 degrees C and 10 degrees C, activity at 18 degrees C was considerably reduced. Under field conditions the activity of inoculum was strongly influenced by season. On day 49 there was little or no activity during spring, summer or winter. However, during autumn a mean proportion of 0.08 aphids still became infected with P. neoaphidis. Margin type did not affect the activity of conidia nor was there a difference in activity between blocks that had regenerated naturally and those that had been planted. These results suggest that P. neoaphidis can infect aphids and remain active on soil under the abiotic conditions that occur seasonally in the UK and that this fungus may be able to persist annually without a resting stage.

A two-phase study was conducted in southern Illinois that examined the ability of various riparian buffer species to attenuate fecal coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli (E. coli) in overland flow, while also assessing E. coli persistence in associated buffer soils. Plots established with giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea (Walt.) Muhl.), Kentucky Bluegrass (Poa pratensis), Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), and non-vegetated control buffers were subjected to artificial flooding with cattle (Bos taurus) manure-laden water. Mean bacteria concentrations in overland flow exiting all plots were significantly higher than concentrations found in the source slurry. To assess E. coli persistence in plots, overland flow was collected from a simulated rainfall event 4 days following slurry application, and from natural rainfall events 22, 46, 94, 97, and 111 days after the application. Overland flow exiting all plots (including non-vegetated controls) exhibited mean E. coli concentrations significantly higher than those found in the initial slurry applied. The observed concentrations may have been the result of overland flow characteristics and high levels of ambient fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) present with plots. The moist, shaded conditions created by plot vegetation may have produced prime habitat to harbor FIB. Vegetated buffer strips (VBS) may have been effective at attenuating FIB, however, performance may have been masked by the exceptionally high ambient FIB populations that were present in adjacent soils. The young age of the VBS (< 1 year) may have also influenced their seemingly poor FIB attenuation. As the VBS age, increases in above and below ground vegetative material may act to increase VBS attenuation capabilities.","2013","2020-10-29 20:07:04","2020-10-29 20:07:04","","1405-1419","","","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To study habitat effects on the eastern woodrat (Neotoma fioridana), we surveyed nests of the eastern woodrat in woodlands, grasslands, and croplands along 77 km of secondary roads in three counties in north-central Kansas. All nests were located in woodlands (<2% of habitat), although grasslands and croplands constituted 36% and 62% of habitat surveyed, respectively. In our survey, nests were associated positively with shelterbelts (3.6 nests per 100 m of road edge) but not with shrub patches (1.1 nests per 100 m of road edge) or riparian woodlands (0.3 nests per 100 m of road edge). Consequently, we specifically censused nests in an additional 12 riparian woodlands and 12 shelterbelts. Nests of eastern Woodrats were less dense in riparian woodlands (9.4 nests/ha) than in shelterbelts (55.5 nests/ha). Density of woodrat nests decreased as width of a wooded area increased. Further, nests per 100 m of length of woodland did not increase as the width of woodland increased. These patterns suggest that woodland edge, not woodland interior, is the primary factor in abundance of eastern woodrats in this region. Although the eastern woodrat has previously been considered a woodland species, our results suggest that this assessment is incorrect. Our observations demonstrate that anthropogenic modification of the Great Plains, in the form of planted shelterbelts and expanded riparian woodland, likely has increased the distribution and abundance of eastern woodrats, compared to the mid-1800s.","2001","2020-10-29 20:07:04","2021-10-19 13:14:10","","249-260","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Field margins were subjected to 10 grassland management regimes, which included the effects of spraying the herbicide glyphosate, cutting, leaving vegetation in situ after the cut, sowing and a control. These treatments were randomised within six complete blocks at the University of Oxford’s farm at Wytham. Cutting vegetation had an immediate effect on number of L. tenuis in both spring and summer. Cutting margins in summer had a more persistent effect on populations of L. tenuis than did cutting margins in spring. The effect of cutting was not mitigated by leaving cut vegetation in situ, but no cutting ensured higher number of L. tenuis in margins, an indication that height and structural complexity of grassland vegetation were important in determining population size. Significantly fewer spiders were found in July and September plots which had been sprayed with herbicide in late June/early July. However, spider numbers were not affected by glyphosate application when samples were taken nearly a year later. Sowing a wildflower seed mixture had no significant effects on number of this generalist predator although other invertebrate groups did benefit. Field margins provided an excellent source habitat for L. tenuis.

Knowledge gaps remain about shelterbelts' ecosystem services to the agro-landscape, hence hiding farmers' trade-offs in a changing agriculture. This research first investigated shelterbelts' effect on soil biological activity and fertility. Soil samples were collected in September 2012 from sheltered and non-sheltered fields in the Rural Municipality of Stanley, Manitoba. Results showed that shelterbelts promote higher soil biological activity, potentially correlated to the enhanced organic matter and micro-climate adjacent to shelterbelts. A survey was then conducted to explore shelterbelts' cultural services to the local community. Results indicated that while shelterbelts were perceived to significantly benefit community well-being, they were mainly recognised for agricultural functions. We conclude that shelterbelts are a significant element of both supporting and cultural ecosystem services, contributing to the prairie agro-system resilience. Further research and quantification of shelterbelts' socio-ecological services is recommended.","2013","2020-10-29 20:07:06","2020-11-06 22:43:17","","","122","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9780494958704","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In-stream water and sediment samples that were taken at nine sampling sites of different buffer widths following intense rainfall, and edge-of-field runoff that were sampled in erosion tills were analysed regarding 28 active ingredients of pesticides including copper. In-stream samples contained a mix of 8 +/- 4 pesticide compounds, resulting in total pesticide concentrations of 1.4-8.9 mu g l(-1) for water and 16-670 mu g kg(-1) dw for sediment. Following an exceptional rainfall event with a previous 34-day drought period, pesticide concentrations reached 7.0-83.4 mu g l(-1). Fungicides were the most important pesticides found and were significantly correlated with the pesticide application frequency and rate. The calculated toxicity values per sample (TUmax) indicated that both organic pesticides and copper concentrations likely cause ecotoxicological effects in the field. The buffer strip width was of little importance for pesticide in-stream concentrations because pesticide entry occurred mainly via the field path network and erosion rills. Pesticide in-stream concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with the concentrations detected in erosion rills (R-2 = 0.56).

The need for mitigation measures was investigated at 10 stream sites within an intensively used arable region in central Germany by characterizing pesticide exposure following edge-of-field runoff and effects on the aquatic macroinvertebrates. Moreover, the influence of riparian buffer strip width (as a mitigation measure) at the sampling sites was considered. Generally, invertebrate fauna was dominated by pesticide-tolerant species, suggesting a high pesticide exposure at almost all sites. This result is also reflected by the elevated levels of suspended particle contamination in terms of toxic units (logTUMax>2), corresponding to one-hundredth of the median lethal concentration (LC50) to Daphnia magna. At two sites that received high aqueous-phase entries of the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin (logTUMax>0.6), the abundance and number of sensitive species in terms of the species at risk index decreased during the pesticide application period. In contrast, no acute significant negative effects on macroinvertebrates were observed at sites characterised by low water-phase toxicity (logTUMax<3.5). An influence of riparian buffer strip width on pesticide exposure was not observed, supposedly because of the presence of erosion rills and ephemeral ditches. In conclusion, results show that mitigation measures (such as the improvement of currently present riparian buffer strips) are needed in the study area. Environ Toxicol Chem 2013;32:12541263.

Enhancement of wildlife habitat, while identified as a function of such systems, has often been of secondary importance to soil conservation and water quality objectives. Though greatly important, little consideration has been given to how specific species will respond to the design and management of riparian buffers or other conservation lands. This study compared avian communities within a chronosequence of riparian buffers established on previously cropped or pastured land with those of the nearby matrix land cover types (row crop fields and an intensively grazed pasture). The riparian buffers consisted of native grasses, forbs, and woody vegetation established at three different times (2, 9, and 14+ years prior to survey). At each site, 10 min point counts for breeding birds were conducted using 50 m fixed radius plots, which were visited eight times between May 15 and July 10, 2008. A total of 54 bird species were observed over all of the study sites. The re-established riparian buffers in this study had higher bird abundance, richness, and diversity than the crop and pasture sites. These results suggest that re-establishing native riparian vegetation in areas of intensive agriculture will provide habitat for a broad suite of bird species, but that specific species will reflect successional stage, horizontal and vertical vegetative structure, and compositional diversity of the buffer vegetation. These results emphasize the importance of matching buffer design and management to species requirements if the objectives are to attract specific target species or species groups.","2010","2020-10-29 20:07:10","2020-11-06 22:44:14","","97-110","","","79","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4; Bird habitat, Riparian forest buffer, Iowa, Point count, Species richness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The riparian areas investigated in this thesis are transitions between row-cropped uplands and lower order streams. Riparian areas can serve many functions such as filtering pollutants from overland flow, stabilizing stream bank, storing surface water and sediment, and maintaining biodiversity by providing wildlife habitat. In response to concern about the loss of ecosystem services once provided by natural riparian systems, state and federal agencies have established incentive programs for landowners to convert sensitive lands from agricultural to conservation uses. Soil conservation and water quality are two important riparian functions that were investigated in the first study which measured stream bank erosion. This study was conducted in NE Missouri on stream reaches with different riparian land use/vegetation. The second study focused on the enhancement of wildlife habitat in riparian areas. It compared avian communities within a chronosequence of riparian buffers established on previously cropped or pastured land with those of the nearby matrix land cover types (row crop fields and an intensively grazed pasture). The results of the bird survey support the establishment of designed riparian buffers including trees, shrubs, and/or grass to increase habitat for many bird species in highly modified landscapes such as the agriculturally dominated Midwest. However, the results of the stream bank erosion study did not show that natural perennial vegetation (trees and shrubs) was reducing stream bank erosion in northeast Missouri. Riparian areas are complex and much more research is needed to understand how to utilize and improve their natural functions.","2009","2020-10-29 20:07:10","2020-10-29 20:07:10","","","110","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9781109552256","","","","Ecology; Health and environmental sciences; Biological sciences; 0329:Ecology; eppi-reviewer4; 0528:Natural Resource Management; Avian diversity; Erosion; Erosion pin; Natural Resource Management; Species richness; Stream bank","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cumulative infiltration in the multi-species riparian buffer was in the order of silver maple > grass filter > switchgrass. Cumulative infiltration did not differ significantly (P < 0.05) among corn and soybean crop fields and the pasture. Soil bulk densities under the multi-species buffer vegetation were significantly (P < 0.05) smaller than in the crop fields and the pasture. Other measured parameters did not show consistent trends.

These floral traits are likely to affect the foraging performance of parasitoids in agricultural landscapes. Using a spatially explicit simulation model we explore how the attractiveness and nectar availability of flowering field margins affects their impact on parasitoids and ultimately on pest populations in crops. The model simulates the movement, nectar feeding and parasitism of parasitoids in an agroecosystem composed of a crop and adjacent flower margin. The perception of olfactory cues emitted by flowers and host-infestcd plants drives the movement of the parasitoid. Its preference for floral nectar or hosts is described as a function of its internal energy status. Model validation reveals that simulations and measurements of the spatial distribution and energy status of parasitoids are generally in good agreement. Model simulations suggest that aggregation of parasitoids at flower strips are caused by a prolonged longevity of parasitoids feeding on floral nectar as well as by attraction of parasitoids from the surrounding area. We found no indication for depletion of parasitoids in the field interior as a result of migration towards flower strips. Simulations further suggest that the attractiveness of flowers is an important characteristic that should be taken into account for the selection of flowering plants. This study implies that tailoring nectar supply to the requirements of parasitoids holds potential to increase their effectiveness as biological control agents. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Communities of spiders, ground beetles, true bugs and aphids were sampled in 2years along transects from the centre of organically managed cereal fields into adjacent grassy margins. Based on species richness, abundances, ecological and body size traits of species and taxonomic distinctness between species, communities were compared between organically managed cereal fields and their grassy margins. The species richness, abundance and variation in taxonomic distinctness of true bugs were significantly higher in grassy margins. For spiders and ground beetles, these metrics were either higher in cereal fields or did not differ significantly. At the species level, spiders living under stones or in soil crevices, as well as phytophagous ground beetles and true bugs that overwinter as eggs benefited from grassy margins. True bug communities in cereal fields were dominated by a few abundant species, whereas communities in margins were rather dominated by a few large species. Our comprehensive analyses highlight the importance of accounting for species identities and biology in biodiversity studies. The traits that characterised arthropod species that benefited from margins are not characteristic for pest species. Grassy margins along organic fields therefore represent an important agri-environmental scheme for the conservation of several arthropod taxa and margins should not be removed to increase the crop production area in organically managed cereal fields.","2014","2020-10-29 20:07:15","2021-10-05 16:53:19","","274-287","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to develop field margin management practices that would support invertebrate diversity and abundance on intensively managed grassland farms, focusing on planthoppers and leafhoppers (Auchenorrhyncha). Replicated across four farms in south-west England, we manipulated conventional management practices (inorganic fertilizer, cutting frequency and height, and aftermath grazing) to create seven treatments along a gradient of decreasing management intensity and increasing sward architectural complexity. Auchenorrhyncha were sampled annually between 2003 and 2005. Auchenorrhyncha abundance and species richness was highest in the most extensively managed treatments. Abundance was lowest with frequent cutting, while species richness was lowest where cattle grazing occurred. Unexpectedly, application of inorganic fertilizer had no effect on Auchenorrhyncha abundance or species richness. Management options that enhance invertebrate diversity, while allowing the remainder of the field to be managed conventionally, represent a potentially important conservation tool for many lowland improved grasslands. Extensification of conventional management in field margin areas of such grasslands are likely to benefit this numerically dominant component of grassland invertebrate fauna. These management practices have the potential to be incorporated into existing UK and European agri-environment schemes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Introducing a sown wildflower component has the potential to increase dramatically the value of these buffer strips for a suite of native species, including butterflies. This study investigates management practices aiming to promote the establishment and maintenance of wildflowers in existing buffer strips. The effectiveness of two methods used to increase the establishment of wildflowers for the benefit of native butterfly species were tested, both individually and in combination. The management practices were: (1) the application of a selective graminicide (fluazifop-P-butyl) which reduces the dominance of competitive grasses; and (2) scarification of the soil which creates germination niches for sown wildflower seeds. A wildflower seed mix consisting of nine species was sown in conjunction with the scarification treatment. Responses of wildflowers and butterflies were monitored for two years after establishment. Results indicate that the combined scarification and graminicide treatment produced the greatest cover and species richness of sown wildflowers. Butterfly abundance, species richness and diversity were positively correlated with sown wildflower species richness, with the highest values in the combined scarification and graminicide treatment. These findings have confirmed the importance of both scarification as a means of introducing wildflower seed into existing buffer strips, and subsequent management using graminicides, for the benefit of butterflies. Application of this approach could provide tools to help butterfly conservation on farmland in the future.","2011","2020-10-29 20:07:18","2021-10-05 16:53:19","","221-232","","","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Typically, such strips are floristically species poor and are dominated by grasses. In the present study, we developed management practices to enhance the floristic and structural diversity of these existing strips for the benefit of spiders, a key provider of natural pest control in crops., Across three UK arable farms, we investigated the benefits of: (i) scarification to create germination niches into which wildflower seeds were sown and (ii) the effect of graminicide applications to suppress grass dominance. Spiders were sampled twice per year (July and September) during 2008 and 2009., The combination of scarification with wildflower seeds, as well as graminicide, resulted in the greatest wildflower cover and lowest grass cover, with a general trend of increased abundance of adult and juvenile spiders. The abundance of Pachygnatha degeeri, Bathyphantes gracilis and juvenile wolf spiders of the genus Pardosa was positively correlated with wildflower cover, probably reflecting increased prey availability. Sward structure was negatively correlated with Erigone atra, Oedothorax fuscus and juvenile Pardosa abundance., Management that utilizes existing commonly adopted agri-environment options, such as grass buffer strips, represents a potentially important conservation tool for increasing the quantity and quality of invertebrate habitats. This can maximize opportunities for the provision of multiple ecosystem services, including pest regulation by predators such as spiders.

This study evaluates the comparative effectiveness of three conservation practices in reducing runoff, sediment, N, and P losses from 1.5- by 16-m plots on an Aeric Epiaqualf. Three practices compared are a traditional fescue (Festuca arundinacea) filter strip (Fescue-FS), a switchgrass barrier in combination with the Fescue-FS (B-Fescue-FS) and a switchgrass barrier in combination with a native grass and forbs species filter strip (B-Native-FS). This study also predicts transport of sediment, N, and P in Fescue-FS and B-Fescue-FS. Fescue-FS and B-Fescue-FS of equal widths (0.7 m) significantly reduced runoff and sediment transport as compared with a continuous cultivated fallow (CCF) treatment, but B-Fescue-FS was more effective for reducing runoff (p < 0.05) and sediment (p < 0.01) transport. B-Fescue-FS was also more effective than Fescue-FS for reducing losses of organic N, NO3-N, NH4-N, particulate P, and PO4-P (p < 0.01). Fescue-FS and B-Native-FS were equally effective for reducing runoff, sediment, and nutrient loss. Effectiveness of FS increased with distance with 18% of runoff, 92% of sediment, and 71% of nutrient leaving the source area being reduced in the first 4 m of the FS. An equation to predict sediment associated with runoff ponding above barriers explained approximately 70% of the variability between measured and predicted values of sediment, organic N, and particulate P transport. Combination of switchgrass barriers with FS is an effective alternative to Fescue-FS alone for reducing sediment and nutrients in runoff.","2004","2020-10-29 20:07:20","2021-10-05 16:53:19","","1670-1678","","","68","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Roughly 16,000 ha of filter strips have been established in Maryland through the United States Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program. Filter strips often represent the only uncultivated herbaceous areas on farmland in Maryland and therefore may be important habitat for early-successional bird species. Most filter strips in Maryland are planted to either native warm-season grasses or cool-season grasses and range in width from 10.7 m to 91.4 m. From 2004 to 2007 we studied the breeding and wintering bird communities in filter strips adjacent to wooded edges and non-buffered field edges and the effect that grass type and width of filter strips had on bird community composition. We used 5 bird community metrics (total bird density, species richness, scrub-shrub bird density, grassland bird density, and total avian conservation value), species-specific densities, nest densities, and nest survival estimates to assess the habitat value of filter strips for birds. Breeding and wintering bird community metrics were greater in filter strips than in non-buffered field edges but did not differ between cool-season and warm-season grass filter strips. Most breeding bird community metrics were negatively related to the percent cover of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) in >= 1 yr. Breeding bird density was greater in narrow (<30 m) compared to wide (>60 m) filter strips. Our results suggest that narrow filter strips adjacent to wooded edges can provide habitat for many bird species but that wide filter strips provide better habitat for grassland birds, particularly obligate grassland species. If bird conservation is an objective, avoid planting orchardgrass in filter strips and reduce or eliminate orchardgrass from filter strips through management practices.

In the lower midwestern United States, there is significant interest in incorporating a once common native riparian species, giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea) in riparian restoration designs. Thus, assessing the water quality benefits of giant cane buffers is warranted. Ground water nitrate and ammonium concentrations were measured at the field edge (0 m), and 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, 9.0, and 12.0 m from the field edge through giant cane and forest riparian buffers adjacent to agricultural fields along three streams in southern Illinois. Ground water nitrate and ammonium were not different between the giant cane and forest riparian buffers, nor were there significant reductions in these nutrients through the riparian zones when all three sites were considered. However, site-specific regressions of nutrient concentration vs. distance showed significant reductions (>80%) in nitrate through two forest and one cane riparian buffers, and a significant reduction in ammonium (95%) through a cane buffer.

We studied the effectiveness of a decade of AES in enhancing biodiversity in ditch banks on six modern dairy farms in the Western Peat District in the Netherlands, taking into account the roles of local productivity and of regional diversity and productivity. Biodiversity is characterised as total number of vascular plant species and number of target plant species and productivity as biomass, Ellenberg N-value and grass/forb ratio. We analyzed the repeated AES releves sampled in two periods, 1993-1995 and 2000-2003 and the diversity-productivity relationships in space and over time. For the analysis of the role of the regional factors, repeated AES and reference releves were compared. Number of target species remained stable, whilst the total number of species decreased, and the productivity increased in general in AES ditch banks. We found a clear negative diversity-productivity relationship in space and over time. AES ditch banks showed higher total number of species and comparable to higher number of target species than the reference ditch banks, in general, however, the productivity was also lower in AES ditch banks. The development of AES ditch banks was similar to the regional developments, although differences tended to become smaller in the study period. We hypothesize that the main reason that ditch bank AES do not overall successfully reduce productivity, is because the AES also recommended late mowing and that because of colonization constraints, the region cannot contribute to a positive development. Improvement of AES should, therefore, include adaptation of the mowing regime in high-productivity situations as well as regional strategies to restore the biodiversity of the ditch bank flora.

VFSs have been used in a wide variety of situations to treat runoff from croplands, feed lots, dairy operations, confined animal feeding operations, and roadsides, among other locations. While vegetative matter must regularly be removed from vegetative filter strips in an effort to prevent them from becoming nutrient load sources, very limited attempts have been made (with the exception of biofuel harvesting) to harvest that biomass for a useable purpose. This dissertation examines the novel approach of establishing vegetative filter strips on the ends of surface-irrigated, row-cropped fields with commonly utilized forage species for the direct mitigation of suspended sediment and soluble nutrient loads in overland flow while concurrently producing a marketable forage crop. A review of the pertinent literature is provided followed by a detailed overview of the experimental setup. Five commonly utilized forage crops were used to establish vegetative filter strips of varying lengths on the ends of furrow-irrigated, row-cropped fields in an arid environment. Vegetative filter strips of 3.05 (10 ft), 6.07 m (20 ft), and 9.14 m (30 ft) in width were found to have removal efficiencies exceeding 99% for: total inflow volume, total suspended solids, NO 3 -N, NH4 -H, PO4 -P and total P while yielding marketable forage biomass at a rates roughly comparable to average yields from regional hay farms. Statistical analyses on mean removal efficiencies showed a significant statistical difference among the performance of VFS width and vegetation cover type for mean suspended sediment removal efficiencies, and among vegetation cover type for NH4-N mean removal efficiencies. No significant statistical difference was shown among either vegetation cover types or VFS width for mean removal efficiencies of NO 3 -N, PO4 -P or total P. NH4 -N removal among differing VFS lengths was shown not to be statistically different.","2013","2020-10-29 20:07:24","2020-10-29 20:07:24","","","128","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9781303717758","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One aim was to test methods for increasing the amount of non-cultivated areas with high plant species diversity and at the same time suppressing the occurrence of weeds. The treatments consisted of re-establishing or broadening boundary strips, sowing a mixture of ley grasses and clover, of wild meadow species, or planting bushes. All treatments were managed by yearly mowing and taking away of the plant material. The vegetation was examined on two occasions during a 10-year period. At the second occasion, a set of untreated field boundaries (reference boundaries) in the vicinity of each experiment was examined for comparison. Sowing meadow species changed the species composition substantially compared to untreated boundaries. Out of 32 sown species, 22 remained after 10 years. These species are normally found in well-managed meadows or pastures. Species that did not establish or disappeared tended to be either adapted to moist or to dry conditions. Sowing meadow species kept the abundance of weeds on a lower level than sowing clover and grasses or free regeneration at one site and kept weed abundance lower or at least not higher than in reference boundaries.

Aspects of the sheltering ability of four different windbreaks have been tested: single and double row herbaceous (Tritio secale) shelterbelts, and two different artificial wooden fences, with the same overall average porosity, but with different porosity distributions. Mean velocity, turbulence intensity, skewness distributions and spectral and wavelet analysis have been performed in order to characterise the turbulent flow downstream of the different windbreaks.

The importance of shelterbelt plant diversity for birds was investigated by a survey of 62 sites in the Central West region of New South Wales, Australia. An area search technique was used to assess bird occurrence. An all subsets and exponential regression analysis approach explored the relationships between woody plant diversity and avifauna diversity (using Hill's diversity index), whilst seasonal variations were analysed using restricted maximum likelihood. Sixty-six bird species, including many that are woodland-dependent, representing eight foraging guilds, were observed in the shelterbelts. More species of birds occurred and at higher density in more floristically diverse shelterbelts. Other factors found to influence avifaunal use of shelterbelts were woody plant density, shelterbelt width, structural complexity, tree height, crown cover index and elevation. Seasonal analysis confirmed the importance of these independent variables but also revealed the significance of shelterbelt's proximity to water during summer for birds using this habitat. This study shows that floristic diversity, amongst other factors, is a significant predictor of avifauna diversity in shelterbelts and suggests that shelterbelts may be designed to optimize their wildlife habitat and biodiversity conservation values.

If properly vegetated and managed, they can also produce wood for burning, act as sinks for atmospheric CO2 and enhance the landscape beauty. The paper presents an analysis of the different functions of BS and reviews the more important data from research programmes conducted over the last decade in Veneto Region (North-East Italy). Over a period of 3–5 years, in two experimental sites, young BS reduced total runoff by 33%, losses of N by 44% and P by 50% compared to no-BS. A mature BS was able to abate both NO3–N and dissolved phosphorus concentrations by almost 100%, in most cases having exiting water that satisfied the limit for avoiding eutrophication. The BS also proved to be a useful barrier for herbicides, with concentrations abated by 60% and 90%, depending on the chemical and the time elapsed since application. Considering the CO2 immobilized in the wood and soil together, the different BS monitored stored up to 80tha−1 year−1. The BS caused negligible disturbance to maize, soybean and sugarbeet yields. The hedgerows, particularly if composed of trees taller than 6m, positively influenced the aesthetic value of the territory, improving its perceived naturalness and screening the man-made elements. Lastly, through a multi-objective analysis, opportunity costs were estimated to support the public decision-maker in determining the subsidies to be paid to encourage farmers to plant BS.

Local researches are necessary to gain information on buffer performance, with particular emphasis on narrow buffers. The effect of a 6 m buffer strip (BS) in reducing runoff, suspended solids and nutrients from a field growing maize, winter wheat and soybean was assessed in a field experiment conducted in North-East Italy during 1998-2001. The BS was composed of two rows of regularly alternating trees (Platanus hybrida Brot.) and shrubs (Viburnum opulus L.), with grass (Festuca arundinacea L.) in the inter-rows. The BS reduced total runoff by 78% compared to no-BS, in which cumulative runoff depth was 231 mm over 4 years. With no-BS runoff appeared to be influenced mostly by total rainfall, while with BS maximum rainfall intensity was more important. The filtering effect of the BS reduced total suspended solids (TSS), particularly after the second year, when the median yearly concentrations ranged from 0.28 to 0.99 mg L-1 and were smaller than 0.14 mg L-1, with no-BS and with BS respectively. The combination of lower concentrations and runoff volumes significantly reduced TSS losses from 6.9 to 0.4 t ha(-1) over the entire period. A tendency to increased concentrations of all forms of N (total, nitrate and ammonium) while passing through the BS was observed. but total N losses were reduced from 17.3 to 4.5 kg ha(-1) in terms of mass balance. On the contrary, P concentrations were unmodified (soluble P), or lowered (total P) by the BS, reducing total losses by about 80%. The effect on total P, composed mainly of sediment-bound forms, was related to particulate settling when passing through the BS. A numerical index (Eutrophic Load Index), integrating water quality and runoff volumes, was created to evaluate the eutrophication risk of runoff with or without the BS. It showed that the BS effect was mostly due to a reduction of runoff volumes rather than improving the overall water quality.

When these systemic compounds are applied to seeds, low concentrations are subsequently found in the nectar and pollen of the crop, which are then collected and consumed by bees. Here we demonstrate that the current focus on exposure to pesticides via the crop overlooks an important factor: throughout spring and summer, mixtures of neonicotinoids are also found in the pollen and nectar of wildflowers growing in arable field margins, at concentrations that are sometimes even higher than those found in the crop. Indeed, the large majority (97%) of neonicotinoids brought back in pollen to honey bee hives in arable landscapes was from wildflowers, not crops. Both previous and ongoing field studies have been based on the premise that exposure to neonicotinoids would occur only during the blooming period of flowering crops and that it may be diluted by bees also foraging on untreated wildflowers. Here, we show that exposure is likely to be higher and more prolonged than currently recognized because of widespread contamination of wild plants growing near treated crops.","2015","2020-10-29 20:07:30","2021-10-05 16:53:21","","12731-40","","","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use data from 315 transects, completed as part of a national acoustic survey of bat distribution, to examine the incidence of four bat species adjacent to linear features in rural areas. The use of linear features was assessed in relation to hedgerow width, tree density, the presence of water and woodland proximity. To examine the effect of tree density, linear features were classified as either hedgerows without trees, hedgerows with sparse trees (comprising <50% tree canopy) or tree-lines (>50% tree canopy). The use of linear features by Pipistrellus pipstrellus was not affected by tree density; linear features of all types were associated with a similar increase in P. pipistrellus incidence. The use of linear features by Pipistrellus pygmaeus was dependent on both tree density and the proximity of woodland; only linear features containing trees provided an increase in P. pygmaeus incidence regardless of woodland proximity. P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus incidence was not affected by hedgerow width or the presence of water. Incidence of Nyctalus noctula and Eptesicus serotinus was unaffected by the density of linear features of any type. Many agri-environment schemes offer financial incentives for the creation and management of hedgerows.

The seedbank of each habitat was determined from soil cores in quadrats located at regular intervals along transects, using the seedling emergence method in the greenhouse. The vegetation was surveyed in plots adjacent to the seedbank sampling areas. There was no significant difference in total species richness of vegetation or the seedbank among habitat types. However, there was a marked difference in species composition. In the seedbank, no difference in weed species richness among habitats was observed. In vegetation, however, fields harboured significantly more weedy species than adjacent boundaries and hedgerows. The dissimilarity between the seedbank and the vegetation was confirmed in detrended correspondence analyses, which showed that hedgerow vegetation, and to a lesser extent boundary vegetation, differed from field vegetation and all the habitats of the seedbank. The analysis of soil properties indicated that organic matter and nutrient levels were often higher in hedgerows than in fields. It can be concluded that hedgerows are valuable habitats for plant diversity and that weed species represent a minor component of their overall vegetation composition.","2006","2020-10-29 20:07:31","2021-10-05 16:53:21","","557-567","","","86","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4; Agroecosystems; Field boundaries; Hedgerows; Soil seedbank; Vegetation composition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We describe the vegetation composition of woodlot edges and hedgerows associated with agricultural fields of different farming intensities. We inventoried thirteen woodlot edges and hedgerows in each of three types of farming systems characterized mainly by different frequency of tillage and by different levels of herbicide and fertilizer use. The number and percentage cover of species present did not differ greatly between farming regimes whereas the species composition varied considerably. In habitats adjacent to intensively farmed fields, we found more short-lived grassy-type plants that were largely of introduced origin and of weedy propensity. Conversely, more species typical of the maple-tree association were found in habitats abutting less intensively managed fields. Species composition and abundance also differed with distances into the woodlots and hedgerows. These effects were more noticeable in woodlot edges than in hedgerows. We discuss the results in relation to their conservation as well as their agronomic implications. We suggest that a buffer strip at the edge of cultivated fields may be sufficient for the protection of native plants in woodlots (and probably of other wildlife) and, to a lesser extent, of hedgerows. Furthermore, buffer strips may reduce weed interaction between crop and non-crop habitats.","1998","2020-10-29 20:07:32","2021-10-05 16:53:21","","544-557","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main objectives of this study were to establish the contribution of narrow riparian habitat strips to plant biodiversity in farming landscape and to document whether they could be reservoir of weeds detrimental to agriculture. Twenty-nine sections (>400 m) of riparian habitats adjacent to cropfields were inventoried in summer 1996 and spring 1997, and these were grouped into five vegetation types: (1) herbaceous strips dominated by grasses and devoid of woody species, (2) herbaceous strips dominated by forbs also devoid of woody species, (3) strips with small (<2 m) shrubs, (4) strips with tall (between 2 and 10 m) shrubs, and (5) strips with mature trees (>10 m). A total of 280 (228 herbaceous and 52 woody) plant species were recorded. Overall habitats with trees contained a larger number of herb and woody species than other riparian habitats. However, this was not reflected in the species richness per unit area (quadrats) which meant that habitats with trees were more heterogeneous than other habitat types. Species composition differed considerably among the various riparian habitats when considering forest spring ephemerals, ferns, forbs in general, grasses and woody vegetation. Substantially more native wetland species (obligate and facultative) were recorded adjacent to watercourses than near fields. More weedy and in particular, introduced species, were found in quadrats sampled near cropfields. Although no plant species of special conservation value were located in the riparian habitats, they should deserve special protection in intensive agricultural areas because they harbour a suite of wetland plants (and animals) not found in other farmland habitats. This appears to be especially desirable for those habitats with a well-developed woody vegetation. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Two hundred and forty sticky traps were installed (24 sites) and 170 sweep net collections were conducted (17 sites) in crop fields and adjacent woody hedgerows of organic and conventional sites. A total of 30 807 individual arthropods belonging to 131 families were recorded during the study. No spatial autocorrelation was detected among the arthropod samples. The study showed that beneficial and phytophagous arthropod abundance differed between organic and conventional sites (only with sweep net) but family richness did not. Beneficial arthropods were more abundant in woody hedgerows, while phytophagous arthropods were more abundant in crop fields. This study also demonstrated a strong relationship between plant and arthropod composition. Habitats (total old field cover, total hedgerow length, and Shannon diversity index, all within 250 m radius) in the surrounding landscape influenced arthropod composition but were not leading factors in explaining richness and abundance. It is therefore of prime importance to consider both local factors (management practices and local vegetation) and regional factors such as landscape features as explanatory variables when attempting to explain biodiversity.","2009","2020-10-29 20:07:34","2020-10-29 20:07:34","","492-501","","","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4; Arthropod abundance; Arthropod composition; Landscape features; Organic farming; Richness; Woody hedgerows","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The seven most abundant predator groups recorded were: Araneae > Phalangiidae > Staphylinidae > Coccinellidae > Chilopoda > Hemerobiidae > Carabidae. Araneae, Phalangiidae, Staphylinidae, Chilopoda and Hemerobiidae were found in larger numbers at the wire fence than at the hedge site, whereas the numbers of Carabidae and Coccinellidae adults exhibited no field margin preference. However, more species of Araneae and Staphylinidae were caught at the hedge site, whereas species richness of carabid beetles was greatest at the wire fence. Principal component analysis clearly separated the samples collected from the two habitats based on the assemblages of Araneae, Staphylinidae and Carabidae, and certain species in each of these taxonomic groups appeared to be particularly associated with one boundary type or the other. All the main taxonomic groups exhibited clear seasonal patterns, with distinct peaks in abundance occurring at certain times of the year. The results of the study reinforce the idea that management of field boundaries can be used to manipulate the type and abundance of particular groups of predatory arthropods, and that seasonal patterns should be taken into account in schemes of integrated pest management so that any adverse effects of biocide application on these beneficial species may be minimised.","2014","2020-10-29 20:07:35","2020-10-29 20:07:35","","268-284","","","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although field borders increase bobwhite habitat and increase local populations, understanding how the surrounding landscape influences bobwhite response to this management practice is critical to efficient implementation. We determined the relative influence of landscape composition and field border implementation on bobwhite densities and occupancy dynamics around crop fields in North Carolina and South Carolina, USA. We used 10-minute distance point counts to estimate density, occupancy, colonization, and extinction rates of male bobwhite around 154 agriculture fields, half of which had a fallow field border. We estimated percent of cropland, forest, pasture, early successional, and urban cover within 1-km radius buffers (314 ha) surrounding all point count locations. We examined the influence of 6 predictor variables (landscape composition metrics and field border presence) on bobwhite density and occupancy dynamics. Bobwhite density increased with the presence of field borders. Conversely, bobwhite density decreased as the percentage of urban, pasture, and forest lands increased. The presence of a field border did not influence occupancy, colonization, or extinction rates. However, as the percentage of cropland increased within the landscape, bobwhite occupancy increased and as the percentage of pasture increased, bobwhite colonization decreased. As the percentage of forest and urban increased and cropland decreased, bobwhite extinction rate increased. Our results indicated that local establishment of field borders does not increase bobwhite occupancy rates, but field borders can increase densities in suitable landscapes where bobwhite are present. Habitat restoration for bobwhite will most effectively increase population densities if focused in landscapes dominated by suitable cover types, where bobwhite occurrence is high. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

Riparian buffers established by the CREP program are considered to be beneficial towards the protection of water quality However, the benefit is based upon assumption that planted trees and shrubs survive and grow Little evaluation has been done within the state to document the success of the establishment efforts. We evaluated 63 riparian planting sites located in the Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and Ridge and Valley physiographic provinces of Virginia. Overall, the riparian forests in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont were fully stocked due to a combination of planted and natural regeneration. Riparian forests in the Ridge and Valley region were inadequately stocked, and the region has problems with invasive, exotic species. Major recommendations for improving the success of future riparian restoration;and establishment efforts are to (1) include the potential for natural regeneration when planning CREP plantings, (2) stop mechanized operations in the riparian buffers that reduce planted and natural regeneration (e.g., mowing and disking), (3) reduce herbivory (particularly cattle) within the riparian buffer, and (4) control invasive exotic species as necessary.","2010","2020-10-29 20:07:37","2021-10-05 16:53:22","","105-112","","","65","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yellowhammers began to decline on British lowland farmland in the late 1980s and losses are presently 10% per year. This study examined variation in the habitat selection and breeding success of yellowhammers, allowing an evaluation of whether Britain's yellowhammer decline might have been caused by recent changes in agriculture. 2. Yellowhammer territories were associated with hedgerows, vegetated ditches and wide uncultivated grassy margins around fields. Pasture and silage leys were avoided. Nests were built among herbaceous vegetation in ditches or in the shrubby vegetation of hedgerows. 3. Breeding started slightly earlier on organic farms than on intensively managed farms, but no measure of breeding success differed between farm types. Predation was the cause of most (64%) nest failures. A maximum of three breeding attempts (two successful) was observed per pair, with a mean clutch size of 3·3, a Mayfield nest success rate of 0·46, and 2·6 nestlings fledged per successful brood. These data, together with published estimates of adult yellowhammer survival and of post-fledging survival among other passerines, suggest that breeding productivity is too low to maintain a stable population. 4. The removal of hedgerows or abandonment of hedge management, filling or clearing of ditches, intensification of grassland management and cropping or grazing right up to the field edge, are all likely to have adversely affected yellowhammers on lowland farmland in southern England. Policy reforms that redirect subsidy support to environmentally beneficial management of field margin habitats and retention of winter-feeding sites such as stubbles should assist in restoring populations of breeding yellowhammers on lowland farmland. 5. Our data expand further the array of farmland bird species for which interactions between agricultural change and population change are increasingly understood.

Buffer strips may also favour denitrification through a combination of high soil moisture, NO3− and carbon supply, which could lead to the production of nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas. Denitrification could be further amplified by the presence of earthworms, or by plant species that promote earthworm and bacterial activity in soils. Soils from four farms, comprising maize fields and adjacent buffer strips, were sampled in the fall of 2008. A total of six earthworm species were found, but average earthworm biomass did not differ between buffer strips and maize agroecoecosystems. Nitrate concentrations and net nitrification rates were higher in the maize fields than in the buffer strips; there was no difference in N2O production in soils collected from the two sampling locations. Potential denitrification, measured by acetylene inhibition, varied by two orders of magnitude, depending on experimental conditions; when amended with H2O or with H2O+NO3−, potential denitrification was higher (P <0.05) in soils from buffer strips than from maize fields. Potential denitrification was highest in soils amended with H2O+glucose, or with H2O+NO3− +glucose. Using microcosms, we tested the effect of litter–soil mixtures on earthworm growth, and the effect of earthworm-litter–soil mixtures on potential denitrification. Based on four categories of chemical assays, litters of woody species (oak, apple, Rhododendron) were generally of lower nutritional quality than litter from agronomic species (alfalfa, switchgrass, corn stover). Alfalfa litter had the most positive effect, whereas apple litter had the most negative effect, on earthworm growth. Potential denitrification was 2–4 times higher in earthworm–litter–soil mixtures than in plain soil. Litter treatments that included corn stover had lower potential denitrification than those that included alfalfa or switchgrass, whereas litter treatments that included oak had lower potential denitrification than those that included apple or Rhododendron. Results suggest that potential N2O emissions may be higher in riparian buffer strips than in adjacent maize fields, that N2O emissions in buffer strips may be amplified by comminuting earthworms, and that plant litters that reduce earthworm growth may not be best at mitigating N2O emissions.

Bromide tracer, C(2)H(2), and accumulated N(2)O were monitored at sample wells downgradient from each injection well, Adequate C(2)H(2) concentrations (0.43 mM) to block N(2)O reduction between injection and sample wells were attained in five of the six well clusters tested. Acetylene peak concentrations moved laterally an average of 19% more slowly than the Br peak, N(2)O peak concentrations an average of 8% after C(2)H(3) peaks, Highest denitrification rates of 2.8 and 3.3 mg N L(-1) d(-1) were observed near the surface of the water table within the grass buffer and riparian forest. Shallow groundwater denitrification rates in the adjoining field and 2 m deep into the saturated zone at all three ecotypes were <25% of the highest rates.

GIS-models are increasingly used to assess habitat preferences and distribution of target species, but their accuracy is constrained by availability of digital data layers. We developed a two-steps approach aiming at showing pros and cons of landscape (GIS)- and site-level habitat models, identifying key habitat factors for conservation of a threatened bird species, the red-backed shrike Lanius collurio. A spatially explicit GIS-model was generated using landscape variables, and a second model at site level was developed using fine-scale variables measured on the ground. The GIS-based model was then extrapolated to the entire region to obtain a map of distribution of suitable habitats. Positive associations between shrike occurrence and both hedgerow length and partial shrub cover were detected at both scales. Shrikes were also positively associated with grassland cover at landscape level and with partial cover of untilled herbaceous vegetation at the finer scale, and negatively affected by lucerne cover. The GIS-model led to an affordable map of predicted habitat suitability which should help conservationists to focus on different local priorities, but was unable to identify effects of untilled and lucerne cover. Site-level model gave fine details for habitat management, but its application elsewhere requires ground-measurements of factors. Combining the multiscale models could indicate more urgent actions at large scales (e.g. maintaining suitable habitats, or improving connectivity among isolated patches) and draw a detailed figure of the most suitable habitat for the species. Shrike occurrence was associated with a higher number of shrub and tree species: the indicator value of the species should ensure general benefits for biodiversity from dedicated management. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"7QQ9JDS6","thesis","2004","Bright Jennifer, Anne","Insects on farmland and their importance to granivorous birds","","","","","","Many species of farmland birds have shown huge declines in numbers and range since the 1970s due to agricultural intensification, and these declines have been worst amongst granivorous species. Recent studies have suggested that low abundance of invertebrate chick food may have been important in driving the declines of a number of granivorous species, however causation has still only been proved for the Grey Partridge, whose decline has been attributed to low chick survival due to the indirect effects of herbicides reducing invertebrate abundance. We investigated invertebrate declines and how they may have affected farmland bird populations in a number of ways. There is little long-term data on abundance of farmland invertebrates. Thus we first looked at how representative data from a long-running suction trap was of invertebrate abundance on local farmland. Suction trap catches reflected abundance of aerial invertebrates on local farmland, and also to abundance of epigeal invertebrates in many cases, particularly abundances in predominant crop types. Secondly, we looked at spatial and temporal distribution of invertebrates on farmland in order to make recommendations about how to increase invertebrate availability to farmland bird populations. Field margins were by far the most invertebrate rich habitats sampled. Most differences in invertebrate abundance between different crop types were found early in the season, at this time spring barley and spring oilseed rape had very low abundances. Winter wheat had relatively high invertebrate abundance compared to spring barley at this time. Winter oilseed rape and set-aside had relatively high abundances of the crop types sampled. We investigated how low invertebrate abundance may have affected populations of granivorous passerines by looking for evidence of reproductive trade-offs in a population of Tree Sparrows, and by supplementary feeding experiments with Tree Sparrow and Yellowhammer chicks. There was no evidence for reproductive trade-offs within years, conversely an effect of individual quality was found. There was some evidence of reproductive trade-offs between years. Supplementary feeding increased the mass of Tree Sparrow first broods early in May but not later in May, and also of chicks with yearling parents, who had a lower provisioning rate. Chicks fledged early in May had a lower survival rate to the following year than chicks fledged later, supplementary feeding and parental age had no effect on chick survival. Supplementary feeding a parent's first brood had no effect on their later reproductive output that season, or on their survival to the next breeding season. Supplementary feeding Yellowhammer chicks early season increased their mass, but had no effect later in the season. This complies with results from a previous study of Yellowhammers in southern England, which showed that a higher proportion of chicks fledge late in the season. Further analysis of this data showed that this was because chicks were more likely to starve early in the season, and also that chick mass was lower early season, even when just looking at chicks which went on to fledge. Thus, it would appear that low invertebrate abundance was affecting the granivorous passerines looked at most in the early season, and through chick mass and survival. Measures to increase invertebrate abundance at this time would be beneficial to populations of granivorous passerines.","2004","2020-10-29 20:07:43","2020-10-29 20:07:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous examples of AES enhancing the abundance of farmland birds have been restricted to targeted species recovery programmes, often with bespoke habitat management and high levels of advisory support for landowners. Here, we tested whether standard higher-tier AES agreements targeted at multiple species and with lower levels of advisory support than targeted species recovery programmes can enhance the breeding densities of farmland birds. Surveys of breeding birds were undertaken during 2008 and 2011 on 65 farms under higher level stewardship (HLS) and 21 farms lacking AES interventions, in three regions of England. After allowing for any impacts of predator control, changes in density were more positive on HLS farms in at least one region for six priority species. Five of the six species had mixed diets and were predominantly associated with field edges; the other (lapwing) probably responded to the provision of field-centre fallow plots. Changes in bird numbers were not consistently related to the extent of AES habitat provision. This is the first study to demonstrate that standard AES management without substantial ongoing advisory support can increase or maintain the densities of widespread declining species.

The grey partridge is a species of conservation concern, in common with many farmland birds. Its widespread decline in western Europe has been attributed to agricultural intensification. Attempts to restore populations have concentrated upon habitat management. In France, a mosaic of strips planted with maize- or kale-based mixtures is widely used to benefit the grey partridge on intensively cultivated farmlands. The rationale for planting these summer-to-winter cover strips is to increase the overwinter survival rate and hence breeding density. Although this policy is costly to apply, there is little information on its effectiveness. 2. We tested effectiveness of this management scheme as a practical way of improving or restoring partridge populations. We present data from a 6-year before-after control-impact (BACI) experiment replicated across four study sites. We monitored partridge populations to estimate breeding density, reproductive success and overwinter mortality. 3. During the course of the study, no partridge population increase occurred on managed areas compared with control areas. Wildlife cover strips did not improve reproductive success but were associated with higher overwinter 'apparent mortality' rates. 4. Some field data suggested that there was a predation risk at cover strip-field edges. Cover strips may concentrate a number of species within small isolated areas and may act, under some circumstances, as an ecological trap for prey species such as the grey partridge. Due to these complex and unforeseen interactions, this habitat management measure proved unsuitable for partridge restoration. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study has demonstrated the necessity of field experiments at a farm-scale to test the effectiveness of habitat management schemes. A priori assumptions based on smaller scale studies, even if they are supported by some field evidence, can be misleading because they fail to capture the emergent properties of larger scale systems. This study is a specific illustration of how the BACI approach is a powerful tool for addressing wildlife management problems at large spatial scales.","2004","2020-10-29 20:07:44","2021-10-05 16:53:24","","846-857","","","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the 1970s, governments have introduced agri-environment schemes (AES) aimed at mitigating this impact, but information on their success is limited. A five y, farm-scale experiment was conducted to test the efficacy of England's Environmental Stewardship AES in enhancing the species richness and abundance of small mammals (voles Cricetidae, mice Muridae, and shrews Soricidae) in an intensively-farmed arable landscape. Small mammal communities were sampled in spring and autumn on grassy field margins installed under the Entry Level Scheme (ELS) tier of Environmental Stewardship, where 1% of cropped land was converted to wildlife habitats. Results were compared with those from field margins on a second, experimental treatment (ELS Extra: ELSX) in which 5% of cropped land was taken out of production, and also field margins on a conventionally-farmed control treatment ('cross compliance': CC). Species richness and abundance of small mammals showed a significant increase on all treatments in spring and autumn. Many increases were greater on ELS and ELSX field margins compared to the CC controls, but there was little evidence that ELSX was more beneficial than ELS, and there were species-specific differences. Voles were not detected on any treatment in the initial sampling period but bank voles Myodes glareolus rapidly became abundant thereafter, particularly on ELS and ELSX field margins, and field voles Microtus agrestis also colonised. Wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus were present on all treatments in all sampling periods, but spring abundance declined as vole abundance increased. These results suggest that the Entry Level Scheme tier of the English agri-environment scheme is effective in enhancing small mammal communities on arable farmland, with potential benefits for higher trophic levels via their predators.

Studies examining these effects simultaneously are rare. Here we explore the direct top-down and direct and indirect bottom-up forces regulating the abundance and predation success of an intermediate predator, the web-building spider Argiope bruennichi (Araneae: Araneidae). We manipulated plant diversity (2, 6, 12 or 20 sown species) in 9 wildflower strips in a region of intensive farmland. To identify the major factors regulating the distribution and abundance of A. bruennichi, we quantified three characteristics of vegetation (species diversity, composition and vegetation structure) as well as the spider's prey community and natural enemies. The distribution and abundance of A. bruennichi was regulated by combined bottom-up and top-down processes as well as by direct and indirect interactions between trophic levels. Four main factors were identified: (1) the strong direct effect of vegetation structure, (2) the positive effect of plant species diversity, which affected spider abundance directly and indirectly through increased densities and size of flower-visiting prey species, (3) the positive or negative direct effects of different plant species, and (4) the strongly negative direct effect of predacious hornets. The advantage of taking a global approach to understand the regulation of species abundance is highlighted first by the quantification of the relative importance of factors, with a surprisingly strong effect of hornet predators, and second by the discovery of a direct effect of plant diversity, which raises intriguing questions about habitat selection by this spider.","2012","2020-10-29 20:07:46","2020-10-29 20:07:46","","706-714","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At 3 and 30 m into the crop from the conservation strip, total mortality, mortality from predators, parasitoids and unspecified factors were measured. Total pollen beetle larval mortality was 66–96%. Mortality caused by predators was 16–27% and there was no significant difference between mortality at 3 m and that 30 m from the extensively managed meadows. However, in fields with wild flower strips adjacent to them, the percentage mortality from predators was significantly greater at 30 m than at 3 m. The range of parasitism of pollen beetle larvae was 0–54% and was on average greater at 3 m than at 30 m. In fields with wild flower strips, the percentage parasitism with Tersilochus heterocerus was significantly higher than in fields with extensively managed meadows. However, mortality from all parasitoids was only 1–2% and there was no significant difference between 3 and 30 m. The effect of parasitoids on pollen beetle mortality was masked by the high unspecified mortality and the mortality from predators. The unspecified mortality was 46–72% and was significantly greater in 1998 and 1999 than in 1996 and 1997. These differences are probably because of meteorological factors (wet in 1999 and dry in 1998). The possible influences of the two types of conservation strips on pollen beetle larval density were investigated. The results show that in fields with adjacent wild flower strips, the pollen beetle larvae were more evenly distributed (but not significantly so) than in fields with extensively managed meadows where larval density decreases faster from the edge into the rape field.

To test whether the biota of these source habitats differed, we collected ground-dwelling spiders (Araneae) from thin (< 15 m) riparian forests, wide (> 50 m) riparian forests and hedgerows (< 15 m wide) located next to soybean or corn fields in south-west Ohio. Pittall traps collected spiders at the stream edge, the interior of forests or hedgerows and the agricultural edge. Rarefaction analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination tested how spider diversity and community structure, respectively, differed between hedgerows and riparian forests and by trap location. Wide riparian forests harbored a higher diversity of spiders than thin riparian forests and hedgerows contained the lowest spider diversity. The latter result may be due in part to the invasive honeysuckle shrub Lonicera maackii in hedgerows, which can reduce habitat complexity on the ground-layer. Ordination analysis revealed the spider community found at the edge of hedgerows is distinct from other trap locations, as was the spider assemblage located adjacent to the stream, the latter containing some hygrophilous species. The spider fauna at the edge of hedgerows contained several species typically round in high densities in agricultural plots, supporting the need for these habitat ligatures in an agricultural landscape.

All birds settled within the ca. 30% of the study area where the proportion of enhanced areas was highest (5.8%). At the level of the individual family group, we found a significant over-proportional use of enhanced areas throughout the year. Furthermore, when the birds used the agricultural fields, the use densities strongly declined with distance from the nearest enhanced area. Thus, the availability and spatial distribution of ecologically enhanced areas were the main determinants of the partridges’ range use. These results indicate that a framework of ecologically enhanced areas is a key habitat structure for grey partridges, and that these enhancements, even if small in proportion, were the crucial first measure to restore the research area to an appropriate grey partridge habitat and, thus, the basis for successful re-introduction in this intensively cultivated area.

Their species composition depends on the history of the countryside, as well as current farming practices. Land use and boundary management play a major role in determining the floristic composition of hedgerows, and are strongly related to the grain size of the field's mosaic. Hedgerow networks, due to their rectilinear shape, and with their high degree of connection, enhance or interrupt many fluxes in the landscape. Hedgerows act as a corridor of movement and dispersal for many forest species, such as carabids, small mammals, and plants. On the other hand, hedgerows interrupt or slow down air fluxes and the propagules they carry. In the heterogeneous mosaic of fields and wooded patches, hedgerows often increase the functional connectivity of rural landscapes. The future of hedgerows depends on the changes of the rural society, which includes more and more nonfarmers.

They are among the most threatened agricultural landscapes of western Europe. Intensification of agriculture with the conversion of permanent grassland into ploughed land and the use of new machinery leads to the enlargement of fields and the removal of hedgerows surrounding them. There is a growing concern among conservationists, rural managers and the public to maintain these greenways as a framework for landscape sustainability. In France, hedgerow removal may be planned within reallotment programmes that take into account all the land of a municipality. In this planning process, criteria for keeping or clearing woody elements are based on agronomic properties of soil, environmental quality of elements and of the network, and property boundaries. Aesthetic aspects are rarely assessed. As rural landscapes are shifting from an almost unique function of agricultural production toward a multifunction of nature conservation, environmental protection, amenity and production, the conservation of hedgerow networks becomes of greater importance. The goal is now the protection of these greenways to provide not only ecological but also recreational and cultural benefits. In a case study in Brittany, we tried to link these different aspects. Our work is based on interviews and a landscape ecological survey. We found contrasting opinions between farmers and non-farmers concerning the density of the network. Nevertheless, the two groups agree on the necessity to keep greenways as part of their cultural landscape. Most of the people were not aware of the ecological role of hedgerow networks, and perceive them only by their visual properties. We proposed various scenarios based on ecological and aesthetic principles, and defined general guidelines for the design of new landscapes during reallotment programmes. The integration of different points of view by landscape planners is the only way to link visual values to productive or ecological processes, and must be effective in the case of the management of greenways such as hedgerows. © 1995.","1995","2020-10-29 20:07:56","2021-10-05 16:53:24","","327-340","","","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analysed territory settlement by two widespread but declining farmland buntings with contrasting nesting requirements: the Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella, a boundary-nesting species, and the Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra, a ground-nesting species. The study was conducted on farms participating in the English Higher Level Stewardship scheme to test whether territory settlement is influenced by the provision of key arable AES options. Both species settled preferentially in localities containing sown arable field margins, while Corn Bunting also settled in localities containing nectar flower mixtures. These preferences are likely to reflect foraging rather than nesting habitat requirements. Yellowhammer selected territories containing hedgerows under AES management, which are nesting rather than foraging habitat but may also provide food. Uptake by land owners of several AES options likely to provide limiting resources for farmland birds was very low, and because uptake at the landscape scale is also low, wider-scale population level benefits are likely to be constrained. However, this is one of few studies demonstrating selection of widely applied arable AES options by breeding farmland birds.","2015","2020-10-29 20:07:59","2021-10-05 16:53:24","","153-163","","","156","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Measurements were made of water and nitrate moving from arable land through the riparian zone and into the river. Techniques to measure denitrification were tested and applied, and the factors controlling denitrification measured. While there was considerable potential for denitrification at the site, this was not realized because much of the water moving off the farmland bypassed the riparian zone, entering the river directly via springs or through gravel lenses beneath the floodplain soil. Management of this site would not reduce nitrate leaching unless the floodplain hydrology could be substantially modified, and the main conclusion is that nitrate buffer zones will only operate efficiently where the hydrology of the site is appropriate.

We found that C. musculinus selects borders over cropfields, but there were not differences between types of fields or types of borders. The structure of the spatial heterogeneity, which is mainly grouped between macrohabitats due to agrarian labors, did not allow to detect habitat selection, within cropfields and borders, for habitat patches larger than individual trap sites.

Predictive habitat models relating bird abundance and damage to characteristics of the agricultural environment at multiple scales are a key tool for designing management programs to reduce impacts of birds on agricultural production. In this study, we explored habitat features influencing abundance and damage of monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus) to corn (Zea mays) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) fields, as a basis for the design and evaluation of management strategies for preventing damage in the future. Using a multi-level approach, we evaluated within-field, field, and landscape variables at three spatial scales potentially related to monk parakeet abundance and damage in crop fields. Monk parakeet abundance and damage was greater in sunflower than in corn fields. Landscape variables, such as distance to nearest site with trees, percentage of landscape with trees, and availability of foraging sites for monk parakeets around the crop fields were more important than local variables in explaining monk parakeet damage to crop fields. However, local variables, such as field area, plant density and percentage of field border with trees, also were related to damage. Relationships varied depending on the crop under consideration and spatial scale of analysis. Based on this study, managers should consider both local and landscape factors when planning management measures to prevent bird damage to crops. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, it is important to understand the role of hedgerows in runoff and sediment processes. In this study, 36 field runoff simulation experiments were conducted in the red soil region of China to determine flow hydraulics and soil loss processes under 12 different hedgerow conditions. Specifically, two types of hedgerow widths (two-row and three-row) were planted for each of three species of vegetation (Bahia grass (Paspalum notatum), Vetiver (Vetiveria nigtitana) and Daylily (Hemerocallis fulva)), and these plots were tested both before and after the removal of the grass stems. Grass stems played an important role in decreasing the flow velocity and filtering sediment. For the three selected vegetation types, the final flow velocities (V3) were ranked in the following order: Bahia grass (0.12 m/s) < Vetiver (0.17 m/s) <Daylily (0.19 m/s). There was no significant difference between the three grass species in trapping sediment under the condition of this study. A comparison between the two different hedgerow widths revealed that the three-row hedges were more effective (decrease ratio >30%) than the two-row hedges (decrease ratio <20%) in reducing the flow velocity ahead of the grass barriers (V2). Nevertheless, soil losses from the grass hedges were mainly related to the final flow velocity (Pearson's R = 0.66, N = 36) rather than the V2. The final flow velocity and the total soil loss rate did not decrease remarkably when using the three-row hedges. These results could be used to provide sound field recommendations for designing and managing hedges in the red soil region of China. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This study was conducted to determine the impact of different buffer designs on soil biochemical parameters and to define relevant quality parameters for soil monitoring. We compared four buffer arrangements: 3m wide grass buffer; 3m grass with one tree row; 6 m grass with one tree row; 6 m grass with two tree rows; plus two controls: an adjacent maize crop field and a plot without buffer. Buffers were established 13 years ago at the Padua University Experimental Farm in the Po Valley, north-east Italy. Studied parameters included soil organic matter composition and soil microbial and enzymatic assays. As expected, control plots showed the lowest values for all the studied parameters. Among buffer designs, 3m grass and 3m grass with 1 tree row buffers gave the highest values. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the increase of soil organic carbon content distinguished buffers from controls, whereas soil humic carbon quality parameters such as humic compounds apparent molecular weight, together with acetyl esterase (fluorescein test) enzyme activity, were discriminatory in separating buffer designs. These results are an important contribution to the knowledge base and can help to improve the management of these systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Previous research has shown that the annual runoff of each herbicide is typically less than 1 g ha−1. A model for the detection of the return period of rainfall events was recently proposed for a site in the north-eastern Po Valley, Italy. The return period model suggested that most of the herbicide loss by runoff (about 98%) is caused by a few, or even just one, extreme rainfall event with a return period of about 25–27 years, whereas ordinary events (4–5 each year) account for the rest. The present study aims to validate that model by comparing model predictions with the experimental results obtained in the 2010–2011 sampling season (independent test data), and to evaluate the effectiveness of the VFS. In addition, a 7-yr dataset of metolachlor and terbuthylazine concentration in real runoff events is summarised in order to highlight the medium-term magnitude of the pollution. Results show that on the Po Valley plain, 3–4 runoff events of low intensity are expected in spring–summer and that the consequent annual runoff of the herbicides metolachlor and terbuthylazine is about 0.5–0.7 g ha−1yr−1. A summary shows that, owing to their chemical-physical properties, concentrations of the two herbicides are similar, both varying from about 0.01–300 μg l−1, with a potential pulse-like exposure risk for aquatic communities in waterways. This study showed that vegetative filter strips can reduce herbicide transfer to surface water by 90–98%, and should be suggested for environmental schemes at field and catchment scale.

Pitfall trap sampling conducted in 1996 and 1997 examined the effect of refuge strips and cover crops on enhancing the seasonal activity-density of carabid beetles. The study site followed a soybean, Glycine max L. Merr, oats, Avena sativa L., and corn, Zea malls L., rotation. Refuges consisted of a central strip of 3 perennial flowering plants, Agastache foeniculun (Pursh) O. Kuntze, Origanum vulgare L., and Scropularia nodosa L, with orchard grass, Dactylis glomerata L., white clover, Trifolium repens L., and sweet clover, Melilotus officinalis L., seeded on each side. A cover crop was present only in 1996 and consisted of frost seeded red clover; Trifolium pratense L. A total of 5,117 and 2,316 carabid beetles was captured in pitfall traps comprising 14 species in 1996 and 20 species in 1997. Carabid beetle seasonal activity-density was greater (1996) or equal (1997) in refuge strips than in control areas without refuge strips; however, the presence of a refuge strip did not alter carabid populations in the surrounding subplots in either year. In 1996, subplots containing a cover crop had significantly higher carabid beetle activity-density than subplots without a cover crop. There was no carryover effect of cover crop on beetle activity-density in 1997. Among the most abundant species, a greater proportion of captures of the fall breeding species Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger), Pterostichus permundus (Say), and the spring breeding species Poecilus lucublandus (Say) occurred in the refuge strips. The spring breeders Poecilus chalcites (Say), Harpalus herbivagus Say, and Agonum cupripenne (Say), and the phytophagous fall breeder Harpalus pensylvanicus (De Geer) occurred in greater proportions in the crop areas. The potential use of these strategies for conserving carabid beetles in agricultural systems is discussed.","1999","2020-10-29 20:08:14","2021-10-05 16:53:25","","","","","- 28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4; - 60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite their wide use, little is known about the effects of establishing shelterbelts on soil macro invertebrates, especially earthworms, which are of major importance in soil processes. We assessed earthworm composition, diversity and biomass in three land use systems: native shelterbelts dominated by Acacia and Eucalyptus species, agricultural pastures and native remnant woodland fragments dominated by Eucalyptus blakelyi and/or Eucalyptus melliodora . Earthworm communities differed significantly among systems, with abundance, biomass and diversity greatest under pasture. Within shelterbelts we saw a shift from high earthworm biomass and density to low with increasing time after establishment. Soil edaphic variables did not correlate strongly with earthworm biomass or density, but were correlated with earthworm community composition. Overall the introduction of native woody vegetation was associated with a decline in density and biomass of earthworms, including a decrease in the relative abundance of exotic species. As such shelterbelts can be used to promote native earthworm relative abundance, which may be important for local diversity, soil function and landscape connectivity.

The experimental system consisted of four replicate plots in a three-way completely randomized design (no buffer zone, grass buffer zone, and grass+tree buffer strips). The field plots were 5 m wide and 30 m long and grown in corn. The grass and grass+tree buffer strips were 5 m and had the same grass vegetation except for eight young hybrid poplars. Over the 2-yr study, surface runoff and subsurface infiltration water (under the buffer strip) were collected after the initial three rainfall events after herbicide application.

The presence of buffer strips decreased the exported masses of atrazine and metolachlor in surface runoff. A three-way ANOVA with treatment (type of buffer strip), water (surface runoff or subsurface infiltration), and time between herbicide application and rainfall event as factors showed a significant reduction (40-60% in 2004 and 75-95% in 2005) in the total (surface runoff+infiltrated water) exported masses of atrazine and metolachlor in the presence of buffer strips. Rainfall events after herbicide application were different between the 2 yr and greatly affected the flow distribution (e.g., subsurface infiltration) and the leached herbicide concentrations. No significant difference in the capacity to reduce herbicide exports was observed between grass and grass+tree buffer strip treatments; the poorly developed young poplar biomass at the time of the study may partly explain this observation.","2010","2020-10-29 20:08:17","2021-10-05 16:53:26","","617-629","","","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Declines in abundance and diversity of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) in Europe have been linked to agricultural intensification and the resulting loss of suitable foraging and nesting habitats. Environmental Stewardship (ES) is a new scheme in England offering the opportunity to restore habitats of value for these important pollinators to agricultural land. Scientific evaluation of the options prescribed within the scheme is essential to ensure that their objectives are met and that the benefits can be realized by the full bumble bee species assemblage. 2. We compared the efficacy of different ES options for field margins on arable land in enhancing the abundance and diversity of flowering resources and foraging bumble bees. Our study was conducted over 3 years using a multisite experiment. 3. Overall, uncropped margins sown with mixtures containing nectar and pollen-producing plants were more effective in providing bumble bee forage than margins sown with a grass mix, allowed to regenerate naturally or managed as conservation headlands. 4. A mixture of agricultural legumes established quickly and attracted on average the highest total abundance and diversity of bumble bees, including the rare long-tongued species Bombus ruderatus and Bombus muscorum. However, marked differences were observed between species and sexes in their responses to field margin management over time. 5. A diverse mixture of native wildflowers attracted more of the shorter-tongued Bombus spp. and provided greater continuity of forage resources, especially early in the season. Allowing Cirsium spp. to flower on such margins also increased their attractiveness to male bumble bees. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the legume-based 'pollen and nectar flower mix', as prescribed under Entry Level Stewardship in England, can quickly provide a highly attractive forage resource for bumble bees, but that issues of seasonal flowering phenology and longevity of the mixture need to be addressed. Establishment of 'floristically enhanced margins' under Higher Level Stewardship will be important to provide diverse perennial communities of forage plants and to support a greater range of Bombus spp. and other pollinators. The population-level responses of bumble bees to introduced seed mixtures and other agri-environment options require further study in order to maximize the benefits of such schemes in intensively farmed landscapes.","2007","2020-10-29 20:08:18","2020-10-29 20:08:18","","29-40","","","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While landscape context and habitat quality are known to influence species richness and abundance of bees, there is a lack of evidence from manipulative field experiments on bees' responses to adaptive management across differently structured landscapes. We present the results of a large-scale study that investigated the effects of a targeted agri-environment scheme (AES) on bumble bees (Bombus spp.) over three years in the United Kingdom. Forage patches of different sizes were sown with a conservation flower mixture across eight sites covering a broad range of agricultural land use types. Species richness and worker densities (especially of the longer-tongued Bombus species for which the mixture was targeted) were significantly higher on sown forage patches than on existing non-crop control habitats throughout the three-year study, but the strength of this response depended on both the proportions of arable land and abundance of herbaceous forb species in the surrounding landscape. The size of sown patches also affected worker density, with smaller patches (0.25 ha) attracting higher densities of some species than larger patches (1.0 ha). Our models show that a targeted AES can deliver greater net benefits in more intensively farmed areas, in terms of the number and species richness of bumble bees supported, than in heterogeneous landscapes where other foraging habitats exist. These findings serve to strengthen the evidence base for extending agri-environment schemes to boost declining pollinator populations to a larger number of agricultural landscapes across the globe.","2011","2020-10-29 20:08:20","2021-10-05 16:53:25","","1760-1771","","","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study was based on the comparison of two transects, one with a hedge, the other without, using mainly a dense grid of tensiometers. The influence of the bottomland hedge was located in the area where tree roots were developed, several metres upslope from the hedge, and could be observed both in the saturated and non-saturated zone, from May to December. The hedge induced a high rate of soil drying, because of the high evaporative capacity of the trees. We evaluated that water uptake by the hedge during the growing season was at least 100 mm higher than without a hedge. This increased drying rate led to a delayed rewetting of the soils upslope from the hedge in autumn, of about 1 month compared with the situation without a hedge. Several consequences of this delayed rewetting are expected: a delay in the return of subsurface transfer from the hillslope to the riparian zone, a buffering effect of hedges on floods, already observed at the catchment scale, and an increased residence time of pollutants.

Aims To assess the importance for breeding birds of key habitat elements, such as isolated shrubs, hedgerows and untilled vegetation patches. MethodsWe investigated the habitat preferences of Red-backed Shrikes Lanius collurio in an agricultural environment where key habitat elements have been dramatically reduced. Based upon data from territorial maps, a fine-scale model of habitat preference was developed and the results of three different analytical approaches (binary logistic regression, multimodel inference and hierarchical partitioning) were compared. Results The occurrence of Red-backed Shrikes was positively influenced by the extent of non-grazed/mown grassland, isolated bushes and hedgerows, and negatively influenced by woodland cover. The model highlighted the importance of bushes/hedgerows despite their very scarce occurrence in the study areas (overall, average cover only 7.94%). Breeding densities were rather low, but mean densities were slightly higher in pasture zones in which bushes/hedgerows availability was higher than elsewhere. Conclusion These results confirm the crucial importance of these key marginal elements even in depauperated farmland landscapes.

Groundwater flow and geochemistry were monitored in the riparian zone of a small agricultural watershed in southern Ontario. Hydraulic and geochemical measurements were taken along a transect of monitoring wells extending across the riparian area into an agricultural field. Chloride and nitrate concentrations in groundwater samples collected from the agricultural field were much higher than in samples from the riparian area. A sharp decline in both nitrate and chloride concentrations was observed near the field-riparian zone boundary. It appears that increased recharge within the riparian zone, as compared to the artificially drained field, caused nitrate-rich groundwater from the field to be diverted downward beneath the riparian zone, thus limiting the input of agrochemicals to the riparian area and consequently protecting the stream from potential contamination. Geochemical data also indicated that nitrate was attenuated in the downward moving groundwater. Patterns of dissolved oxygen concentrations and redox potential in the subsurface coincided with the pattern defined by groundwater nitrate. These patterns indicated that conditions within the riparian zone and at depth near the field-riparian zone boundary were conducive to denitrification. A Linear relation between the delta(15)N and delta(18)O values of nitrate from the monitored transect also supported denitrification as the primary nitrate removal mechanism. This study provides a new conceptual model of how riparian zones may prevent nitrate contamination of streams, and highlights the need for a complete understanding of both groundwater flow and geochemistry in riparian environments.

Buffer strips and managed intensive rotational grazing (MIRG) have been proposed to protect and restore stream ecosystems in Wisconsin. However, the ecological implications of a switch from traditional livestock management to MIRG or buffer strip establishment have not been investigated. Differences in small mammal communities associated with riparian areas on continuously grazed and MIRG pastures, as well as vegetative buffer strips adjacent to raw crops, were investigated in southwestern Wisconsin during May-September 1997 and 1998. More species (mean of 6-7) were found on the buffer sites than on the pasture sites (mean of 2-5). Total small mammal abundance on buffer sites was greater than on the pastures as well; there were 3-5 times as many animals on the buffer sites compared to the pasture sites, depending on year. There were no differences in species richness or total abundance between MIRG and continuously grazed pastures in either year. Total small mammal abundance was greater near the stream than away from the stream, regardless of farm management practice but there were no differences in species richness. Buffer strips appear to support a particularly rich and abundant small mammal community. Although results did not detect a difference in small mammal use between pasture types, farm-wide implications of a conversion from continuous to MIRG styles of grazing may benefit small mammals indirectly by causing an increase in the prevalence of pasture in the agricultural landscape.

The distances between them vary from tens of meters to about 3 km. We compared the hydrographs from the remaining 11 hillslopes to the hydrograph at the benchmark hillslope (i.e., hillslope B6 with no treatment). The results showed that: (I) for any individual event in which noticeable surface runoff occurred, the hydrographs from these hillslopes had similar shapes but different magnitudes; (2) for any paired hillslopes, the shape similarity persisted, but the scaling factor (the regression slope between two flow series) changed across events; and (3) for any runoff event, no simple relationship exists between the spatial variation of the scaling factor and the slope, slope length, area, and prairie strip width at the footslope of the hillslopes. Interestingly, we found that for 9 out of the 11 paired hillslopes, 40-70% of the temporal variation in the scaling factors can be explained by the antecedent wetness condition and the maximum hourly rain accumulation. These results suggest that the small-scale surface runoff responses are spatially variable but organized linearly, i.e., shape similarity (or linearity) in space is another feature of the small-scale runoff process. This phenomenon seems to result from the spatial vicinity and small-scale spatial variability of rainfall intensity and antecedent soil moisture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Riparian buffers are often used to reduce agricultural NPS yet the effect of buffers in the watershed is difficult to quantify. Using corrected Akaike information criterion (AIC(c)) and model averaging, we compared flow-path riparian buffer models with land use/land cover (LULC) models in 24 watersheds from the SE Coastal Plain to determine the ability of riparian buffers to reduce or mitigate stream total nitrogen concentrations (TNC). Additional models considered the relative importance of headwaters and artificial agricultural drainage in the Coastal Plain. A buffer model which included cropland and non-buffered cropland best explained stream TNC (R (2) = 0.75) and was five times more likely to be the correct model than the LULC model. The model average predicted that current buffers removed 52 % of nitrogen from the edge-of-field and 45 % of potential nitrogen from the average SE Coastal Plain watershed. On average, 26 % of stream nitrogen leaked through buffered cropland. Our study suggests that stream TNC could potentially be reduced by 34 % if buffers were adequately restored on all cropland. Such estimates provide realistic expectations of nitrogen removal via buffers to watershed managers as they attempt to meet water quality goals. In addition, model comparisons of AIC(c) values indicated that non-headwater buffers may contribute little to stream TNC. Model comparisons also indicated that artificial drainage should be considered when accessing buffers and stream nitrogen.","2013","2020-10-29 20:08:31","2021-10-05 16:53:26","","1161-1176","","","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding sorption and transport of VAs is important for assessing the risk of VAs reaching surface or groundwater resources. Vegetative buffer strips (VBS) affect soil properties that enhance removal of organic pollutants and thus may be a useful tool for mitigating veterinary antibiotic transport from agricultural lands. Therefore, the objectives of this study were: (1) measure the sorption and retention of veterinary antibiotics to soils collected from three different soils series each planted to agroforestry buffer (AGF), grass buffer (GBS), and row crops (RC), and determine the soil physical and chemical properties governing antibiotic sorption to these soils; (2) investigate changes in VA sorption and retention to VBS and cropland soils in the presence of manure-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM); (3) and study and model VA transport through soil columns repacked with VBS and cropland soils in presence and absence of manure-derived DOM. Sorption experiment results show that OTC was strongly adsorbed by all soils and was not readily extractable, whereas SDT and SMZ sorption to soils were weak and therefore highly mobile in soils. The sorption isotherms for OTC and SMZ were well fitted by the Freundlich isotherm model. Further investigation of solid-to-solution partition coefficients ( Kd ) revealed that vegetative management had a significant (P < 0.01) influence on SMZ sorption and followed the order AGF > GBS > RC, and for OTC sorption VBS > RC. Significant differences in Kd values for these VAs were also noted among the soil series studied. Linear regression analyses indicate that clay content and pH were the most important soil properties controlling OTC and SDT adsorption, respectively. For SMZ, organic carbon content, pH, initial SMZ concentration, and clay content were the most important factors controlling sorption. Study of the two most contrasting soils revealed that increasing solution pH from 6.0 to 7.5 greatly reduced SMZ sorption to the Armstrong GBS soil, but little pH effect was observed for the Huntington GBS soil. Although the presence of DOM (150 mg L -1 C) had little effect on Freundlich model parameters, DOM resulted in slightly lower SMZ Kd values, presumably, due to competitive interactions between the VA and DOM for sorption sites. Transport study including 14 C-labeled SMZ or SMZ plus DOM (150 mg L-1 OC) and non-reactive tracer bromide was conducted in saturated columns packed with Huntington soil (silt loam) planted to AGF and RC. Bromide breakthrough curves were fitted with an equilibrium model within the CXTFIT software, whereas SMZ breakthrough was fitted with the HYDRUS-1D software using two-site and three-site models with linear or Freundlich sorption components. Results indicate that the three-site model containing two reversible sites and one irreversible site coupled with the Freundlich sorption component (3S2R-Freu-irrev model) best describes SMZ transport through the columns with model efficiencies of 0.998, 0.994, and 0.991 for AGF, AGF + DOM and cropland soils, respectively. Fitted sorption parameters such as Kd , Kf and N are in the same range of those obtained from equilibrium sorption experiments. DOM effects were not observed due to diluted DOM concentration. Data from equilibrium sorption experiments and column transport experiments suggest that the AGF soil has a larger capacity to retain SMZ than the cropland soil. Overall, this research facilitates our understanding of VA sorption and transport in the environment and supports the use of vegetative buffers to mitigate VA loss from agroecosystems.","2011","2020-10-29 20:08:32","2020-10-29 20:08:32","","","175","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9781267880635","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A corn control was also used in this paired watershed design located in Connecticut. Water, N, and P fluxes were determined for precipitation, overland now, and ground water. Also, an N mass balance was calculated. Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations significantly (P < 0.05) increased as ground water flowed through the restored buffer. Nitrate N (NO3-N) concentrations declined significantly but most (52%) of the decrease occurred within a 2.5-m wetland adjacent to the stream. An N mass balance for the 2.5-m strip indicated that denitrification only accounted for 1% of the N losses and plant uptake was from 7 to 13% of the N losses annually. Ground water was the dominant source of N to the buffer and also the dominant loss. Restoration of the riparian buffer decreased (p < 0.05) overland flow concentrations of TKN by 70%, NO3-N by 83%, TP by 73%, and total suspended solids (TSS) by 92% as compared with the control. Restoration reduced (p < 0.05) NO3-N concentrations in ground water by 35% as compared with the control. Underestimated denitrification and dilution by upwelling ground water in the wetland area adjacent to the stream were believed to be primarily responsible for the decreasing NO3-N concentrations observed.","2000","2020-10-29 20:08:32","2021-10-05 16:53:28","","1751-1761","","","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","; ; ","https://www.crossref.org/openurl?pid=zoteroDOI@wiernik.org&url_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fzotero.org%3A2&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=Ecosystem%20restoration%20-%20Water%20quality%20changes%20from%20riparian%20buffer%20restoration%20in%20Connecticut&rft.jtitle=Journal%20of%20Environmental%20Quality&rft.volume=29&rft.aufirst=J.%20C.&rft.aulast=Clausen&rft.au=J.%20C.%20Clausen&rft.au=K.%20Guillard&rft.au=C.%20M.%20Sigmund&rft.au=K.%20M.%20Dors&rft.date=2000&rft.pages=1751-1761&rft.spage=1751&rft.epage=1761&rft.issn=0047-2425; https://www.crossref.org/openurl?pid=zoteroDOI@wiernik.org&url_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fzotero.org%3A2&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=Ecosystem%20restoration%20-%20Water%20quality%20changes%20from%20riparian%20buffer%20restoration%20in%20Connecticut&rft.jtitle=Journal%20of%20Environmental%20Quality&rft.volume=29&rft.aufirst=J.%20C.&rft.aulast=Clausen&rft.au=J.%20C.%20Clausen&rft.au=K.%20Guillard&rft.au=C.%20M.%20Sigmund&rft.au=K.%20M.%20Dors&rft.date=2000&rft.pages=1751-1761&rft.spage=1751&rft.epage=1761&rft.issn=0047-2425; https://www.crossref.org/openurl?pid=zoteroDOI@wiernik.org&url_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fzotero.org%3A2&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=Ecosystem%20restoration%20-%20Water%20quality%20changes%20from%20riparian%20buffer%20restoration%20in%20Connecticut&rft.jtitle=Journal%20of%20Environmental%20Quality&rft.volume=29&rft.aufirst=J.%20C.&rft.aulast=Clausen&rft.au=J.%20C.%20Clausen&rft.au=K.%20Guillard&rft.au=C.%20M.%20Sigmund&rft.au=K.%20M.%20Dors&rft.date=2000&rft.pages=1751-1761&rft.spage=1751&rft.epage=1761&rft.issn=0047-2425","eppi-reviewer4","❓ Multiple DOI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Agriculture, urbanization or forestry in river catchments can influence river organisms through diffuse effects on hydrology and hydrochemistry, or local effects on habitat character, bank erosion and sediment delivery. Riparian buffer zones are sometimes established to mitigate undesirable effects on salmonids, but consequences for organisms such as macroinvertebrates are less well known. 2. Riparian fencing and tree coppicing were carried out on upland tributaries of the Welsh River Wye (UK) from 1997 onwards with the aim of enhancing conditions for salmonid fish. The present study used routine, agency monitoring data to compare assemblages in three recently managed streams and five adjacent control streams. Data between 1995 and 2004 were used to assess treatment effects through time. 3. Post-treatment (2000-2004) assemblages were richer in recently managed streams than in controls, mostly due to apparent gains of taxa typical of channel margins and lowland, warmer conditions. However, results were equivocal because invertebrate families typical of lowland, more eutrophic conditions increased in occurrence in all reaches irrespective of treatment, while overall richness declined. 4. This study illustrates how routine monitoring data can reveal some effects of riparian land-use and management on stream biota. However, improved experimental design, ideally using a before after control intervention approach, would have allowed more effective assessment in this case study where confounding trends were so marked. We advocate using such approaches in future restoration studies to allow stronger inference and greater statistical power. The recent general decline in the richness of typical headwater organisms in the Wye system requires investigation.

The restoration of degraded riparian zones to improve a range of functions is attracting increasing interest, but there are still questions about (i) how effectively restoration changes riparian or channel conditions; (ii) whether riparian management offsets the effects of wider catchment pressures; and (iii) whether these effects can be detected quantitatively. 2. A catchment-scale experiment was used to assess the effects of riparian restoration on riparian and channel conditions in the Welsh River Wye. In a hierarchically designed survey, variations in river habitat character were assessed among tributaries where riparian zones were recently managed for restoration (n = 9 streams), unmanaged controls (n = 12), intensively grazed pastures (n = 3) and coniferous plantation (n = 3). Management between 1997 and 2003, largely involving coppicing, was designed to exclude grazing through fencing in order to enable vegetation development while creating salmonid refuges. River habitat character was assessed using the UK 'River Habitat Survey' (RHS) method, with habitat variation quantified using Principal Components Analysis. 3. Stream habitats varied significantly among treatment categories. Streams draining plantation conifer had 'harder' channel features, while those draining intensively grazed pasture were characterized by finer substrata and more active channels than elsewhere. Riparian management reduced livestock trampling ( = poaching) and increased algal cover relative to controls. Coppicing and riparian fencing successfully excluded grazing on banks while increasing, in-stream vegetation cover, but did not affect substrata, flow-types and channel features. 4. These data show that RHS can detect habitat variation among streams in contrasting riparian land-use, revealing some apparently significant effects of recent restoration. We advocate longer-term investigations at reach to catchment scales to assess longer-term effects on channel and flow character, and to appraise fully the extent to which local riparian management can offset impairments at a catchment or larger scale, such as altered run-off regimes, sediment delivery and climate change.

Carabid assemblages were examined in a range of riparian zones in intensively managed grassland in Scotland. Carabids were monitored by pitfall trapping in riparian zones open to grazing, wide riparian buffer strips (> 5 m wide), narrow boundary strips (< 2 m wide) and adjacent fields in order to determine factors influencing carabid diversity and assemblage structure. While carabid diversity was greater in open riparian zones and narrow boundary strips when compared to the adjacent fields, it was actually poorer in wide riparian buffers when compared to open zones thus indicating wide buffers may actually be detrimental to carabid diversity. Carabid assemblages in wide riparian buffers were, however, more distinct from the adjacent field than narrow boundary strips or riparian zones open to grazing. Consequently, while the presence of wide riparian buffers may not promote carabid diversity within the actual buffer strips, by adding an additional habitat that supports a distinct carabid assemblage, riparian buffer strips may promote diversity at the landscape level. Carabid assemblage structure was driven by a combination of soil and vegetation characteristics in addition to physical attributes including distance from the watercourse and width of the strip. Only when we have a better understanding of the factors influencing biodiversity within riparian buffer strips can we start to formulate effective management prescriptions that fuse their dual function of pollution mitigation and biodiversity promotion.","2008","2020-10-29 20:08:34","2021-10-05 16:53:26","","2233-2245","","","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hedgerows also yielded few pollinators reflecting the lack of pollen and nectar bearing plant species within hedgerows in this landscape. The highest density of pollinators, and richest pollinator assemblages, were recorded in open scrub, road verges and riparian buffer strips. This was most likely the result of such habitats supporting a diverse array of flowering plant species which in turn provided foraging opportunities for pollinators.

Riparian restoration has been occurring in New Zealand for over 30 years in an effort to minimize this impact, however, little monitor-ing of restoration effectiveness has been undertaken. This study evaluated the impact of riparian plantings on water quality of lowland streams in the Lake Ellesmere catch-ment. A paired-catchment design on four river reaches was used to compare restored riparian buffers with con-trol sites upstream. Chemical water quality sampling was used in conjunction with a macroinvertebrate community assessment. Equivocal benefits of riparian restoration were observed, with improvements in some variables but not in others. Riparian restoration had a positive effect on water quality in terms of increasing dissolved oxygen and decreasing turbidity. However, conductivity increased at planted sites and no changes were observed in other vari-ables. These findings may be affected by the insufficient width of all four buffers, and gaps in the buffer sys-tem contributing to poor water quality. Although variable responses were seen in invertebrate community composi-tion, this research suggests that even narrow planted buffer strips may be effective in improving some water qual-ity parameters. The overall mixed results present a fair assessment of the benefits of riparian restoration that may be expected within a relatively short time following veg-etation establishment. Even when no baseline data have been established prior to restoration, this research showed monitoring can demonstrate the effectiveness of riparian restoration.

The microbes, applied within dairy-farm effluent, were washed into the strips by surface runoff generated at rates of 4-13 litres/min using a water sprinkler system. The effluent and surface and subsurface outflows at the lower end of each plot were sampled for microbial analysis. Flow rate influenced the timing of peak microbial concentration in outflow and the recovery of both microbes. Under high flow, recovery rates varied from 15-100%, and hence entrapment was often minimal. Under the slowest rate of water application, entrapment was much greater (greater than or equal to95%), at least over the 40 min of water application. During large runoff events, and where preferential flowpaths occur, buffer strips need to exceed 5 m in length in order to markedly reduce the delivery of faecal microbes to waterways. Of those microbes trapped in the grass strips under fast flow rates, some were remobilised and washed out following a subsequent runoff event, 5 days later. On occasion, a considerable volume of flow was observed to bypass beneath the subsurface collecting troughs, probably reducing the effectiveness of the buffer strips.","2004","2020-10-29 20:08:38","2021-10-05 16:53:28","","565-574","","","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, being located near a wooded edge may increase grassland bird vulnerability to edge effects through reduced nest survival. We examined nesting bird communities in field margins adjacent to wooded field edges with no buffer (i.e., control), narrow (approx. 10-m) buffers, and wide (approx. 30-m) buffers in an intensive agricultural system in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley, United States. Dickcissel (Spiza americana) and red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) accounted for 97% of nests. Nest density was >7 times greater in wide buffers than in narrow. We modeled nest survival in Program MARK as a function of time (yr and season), nest-site, and local vegetation characteristics. Nest survival was influenced by among- and within-season temporal effects and local vegetation structure, but not by buffer width. Nest success varied substantially between years and within seasons for dickcissel (12.9% and 19.1% early in the seasons of 2003 and 2004, respectively), but not for red-winged blackbird (15.1%). Overall nest-success estimates were similar to noncrop, herbaceous strips elsewhere in the United States, though whether or not these estimates represent population sinks remains uncertain. Based on this research, we advocate integrating upland habitat buffers within intensive agricultural landscapes and emphasize the use of wide buffers when grassland-nesting birds are a conservation priority.

Achieving this goal requires an ability to balance avian benefits with agronomics, which may be facilitated by understanding how bird communities respond to various conservation practices. We evaluated bird richness, abundance, Shannon diversity, and Total Avian Conservation Value in 20 replicates of four Conservation Reserve Program practices in an intensive rowcrop agricultural landscape in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley from May-Jul., 2005-2007. Conservation practices included: (1) large blocks of structurally-diverse early-succession vegetation (6-8 y old trees) and three buffer types; (2) 30 m wide monotypic filter strips with tall dense switchgrass (Panicum virgatum); (3) 30 m wide diverse filter strips with a forb-native warm season grass mixture; and (4) 60 m wide early-succession riparian forest buffers (1-3 y old trees). The breeding bird community was dominated by red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus; 43% of total) and dickcissels (Spiza americana; 42% of total) but commonly included eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea), mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). We observed >= 1.8 X more dickcissels in large blocks and diverse filter strips than other buffers and greater Shannon diversity in large blocks than any buffers (P < 0.05). Diverse filter strips had >= 1.6 X greater overall bird density (7.2 birds/0.6 ha), on average, than all other practices. Based on these data, we conclude that buffers are attractive to farmland breeding birds and may provide important ecological benefits to supplement a conservation management system founded on large blocks of early-succession vegetation.","2014","2020-10-29 20:08:43","2021-10-05 16:53:28","","61-75","","","172","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There were no significant differences between remnant and regenerated hedgerows in the richness or abundance of forest herbs, presumably indicating colonization of regenerated hedgerows.

Sown grass strips harbour high weed diversity but decrease weed richness in adjacent crops. Weed Research 52, 88-97. Summary Sown grass strips have been widely established on field margins across France, because of their expected environmental benefits. They may also enhance the diversity of plant species in the adjacent boundary by buffering them from agricultural practices. However, the strips could act as an extended reservoir for weeds and increase their dispersal into the field. This study evaluated the impact of a 5-m-wide sown grass strip on (i) the weed richness, abundance and diversity of both boundary and field adjacent habitats and on (ii) the width of the edge zone within the field, defined as the zone where boundary habitats impact the flora in the field. We surveyed the flora in 10 fields along continuous transects running from the boundary toward the centre of the field on opposite sides of each field, one side with a sown grass strip and one side without. The establishment of sown grass strips did not change the overall species richness at the field scale, but modified its distribution in the different habitats. In the boundaries, plant species richness, total abundance or diversity (Shannon index) remained unchanged when a sown grass strip was present, whereas these indicators sharply decreased in the crop edge (−10.9 species and −86.4 individuals per 1.25 m2) and in the field margin (−3.6 species and −9.6 individuals per 1.25 m2) where the grass strip was present. Sown grass strips also significantly decreased the width of the edge zone, from 6.5 to 1.5 m for species richness and from 12 to 1 m for species diversity, demonstrating a decrease in weed ingress into the crop.

Unfortunately, other than for climate, detailed time series of historical environments are scarce. In many instances, researchers can only collate disparate and sometimes fragmented information from the literature or from historical or pre-historical sources. 2.Here, we apply modern statistical methods to reconstruct a recent historical time series of environmental change from sparse data collected from heterogeneous sources. Specifically, we deal with record irregularity and the varying levels of uncertainty associated with each datum using state-space models in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. 3.As an example, we reconstruct a time series of a simple landscape feature (hedgerow length) over a large spatial scale (Britain) over a long-time period (50years), by combining both stock estimates and rate of change estimates, gathered from different historical sources. 4.We illustrate the utility of the method by relating the population trends of a hedgerow-nesting passerine bird, the yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella to the reconstructed trends in hedgerow length. Population density was closely related to hedgerow availability, suggesting a potential key role for nesting habitat loss in the yellowhammer decline. 5.The modelling framework we used is flexible and general. The method can be adapted to reconstruct time series of any environmental variables from a variety of sparse and heterogeneous historical sources. © 2010 British Ecological Society.","2011","2020-10-29 20:08:47","2020-10-29 20:08:47","","86-94","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Time series; eppi-reviewer4; Hedgerows; Bayesian state-space models; Habitat loss; Land-use change; Yellowhammer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the Denitrifier Enzyme Activity (DEA) to test how the buffer strip management modifies the denitrification process. The experimental site is composed of a crop field and a 11 m wide grassed buffer strip at the border between the crop field and a tributary to the Attert river, South-East Belgium. Soil samples from the crop field and the buffer strip have been submitted to different imposed conditions combining glucose, nitrate and water saturation to investigate how antecedent water regime, nitrate and carbon content affect denitrification.The work included DEA measurements on undisturbed soil cores freshly sampled.

The influence of the amount and configuration of reconstructed prairie vegetation on the delivery of ecosystem services was investigated in several small catchments at Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge in Iowa. Treatments include catchments entirely in row crops under a no-till, corn-soybean (Zea mays L.-Glycine max [L.] Merrill) rotation, catchments with 10% of the land in prairie located at the base, and catchments with 10 or 20% of the land in multiple contour strips of prairie. During 2009 and 2011 growing seasons, we measured abundance and diversity of aphidophagous insect predators in response to treatment and habitat type (i.e., soybean, prairie). In 2011, we further studied the biological control of soybean aphids by artificially infesting uncaged and caged plants to prevent exposure from predators. While aphidophagous predators were more abundant in prairie, populations of key aphid predators did not significantly differ among treatments. Biological control of the soybean aphid did not differ among treatments or with distance from prairie. Our results suggest that prairie strips, in addition to providing soil and water quality benefits, may increase the populations of beneficial insects, but may not directly impact biocontrol. We propose several hypotheses to explain why we did not observe more soybean aphid predation with the increased abundance of aphidophagous predators in catchments containing prairie.","2014","2020-10-29 20:08:48","2020-10-29 20:08:48","","1185-1197","","","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nitrous oxide (N2O) may be evolved in these settings. It is a radiatively important trace gas and intermediate in the denitrification pathway and several other microbial processes. We measured N2O flux, after simulated rain, using a soil cover technique in poultry-manured plots and grass filters receiving their runoff. Intact soil cores were used to relate the N2O flux to the denitrification potential of the plots. Nitrous oxide fluxes were smaller in grass filters than in manured plots, even though more denitrifying bacteria were present. The average N2O flux in the three most dynamic erosion plots was 755 mug N2O-N m-2h-1, which was 39% of the maximal denitrification rate measured in acetylene-blocked, NO3--amended soil cores.

While soil erosion in surface runoff is frequently managed by grass filter strips, this management practice may not be an equally effective control for fecal bacteria. We measured soil and fecal coliform trapping in surface runoff from two poultry manure-amended plots in a simulated rain study. The simulation reflected a worst-case event in which poultry waste application was followed by high intensity rain. Grass filter strips, 9 meters long, trapped more than 99% of the soil in surface runoff but fecal coliform trapping was less effective. The efficiency of fecal coliform removal from surface runoff was 74% and 43% in the two plots studied. Fecal coliforms in surface runoff always exceeded primary contact water standards of 200 fecal coliforms/100 ml. These data indicated that grass filter strips which adequately controlled sediment runoff were inadequate to bring surface water contaminated with fecal bacteria into compliance with current primary water contact standards.","1995","2020-10-29 20:08:50","2021-10-19 13:14:41","","405-408","","","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our objectives were to determine (i)if poultry manure stimulated N2O loss in soil after rainfall and (ii) if there was an edge-of-field effect on N2O loss in grass filters intercepting runoff from amended soil.

The mobility of pollinating animals is significant to their importance but we know little about how landscape structure influences pollinator movements. Linear landscape features such as hedgerows and embankments are conspicuous features of agricultural landscape structure and are important artificial habitats in their own right. However, there has been some debate as to the function of these landscape elements as corridors between larger expanses of semi-natural habitat separated by urban and agricultural habitats. Few studies have specifically studied insect flight responses to linear landscape elements. By observing bumblebee flight behaviour along hedgerows and, by creating a medium-scale experimental array of flower patches using an artificial linear feature, we examined whether such structures can elicit an oriented flight response along them and therefore facilitate insect movement through the landscape. We found that both hedgerows and artificial linear landscape features can influence the flight directions of bumblebees ( Bombus spp. Hymenoptera, Apidae), one of Europe's most important groups of pollinators. A bioassay experiment in which Salvia pratensis (Lamiaceae) was planted into landscape patches with differing numbers of connecting hedgerows showed that this directional response can have a profound effect on plant reproductive success - plants had increased pollinator activity, pollen receipt and subsequent seed set in patches with more connections. The overall hedgerow connectedness of a landscape is therefore important both to bumblebee movement and to those plants which depend on bumblebees for pollination services.

Important soil functions like structural maintenance and nutrient cycling are affected by earthworms, thus it is essential to understand how arable farm management influences earthworm species. One aim of arable field margin strips and non-inversion tillage is to enhance agrobiodiversity, however their influence on earthworm species assemblages remains unclear. In particular, on-farm studies conducted over multiple years that capture variability across the landscape are rare. The current study monitored earthworm species assemblages on 4 farms in Hoeksche Waard, The Netherlands, from 2010 to 2012. It was hypothesised that arable field margin strips (FM) and non-inversion tillage (NIT; a reduced tillage system that loosens subsoil at 30−35 cm depth) would have higher earthworm species abundances (epigeics and anecics in particular), soil organic matter, and soil moisture than adjacent mouldboard ploughing (MP) fields, and that earthworm numbers would decrease with distance away from FM into arable fields (MP only). FM contained a mean total earthworm abundance of 284 m −2 and biomass of 84 g m −2 whereas adjacent MP arable fields had only 164 earthworms m −2 and 31 g m −2 . Aporrectodea rosea , Lumbricus rubellus , Lumbricus terrestris , and Lumbricus castaneus were significantly more abundant in FM than adjacent arable soil under MP. However, no decreasing trend with distance from FM was observed in earthworm species abundances. A tillage experiment initiated on the farms with FM showed that relative to MP, NIT significantly increased mean total earthworm abundance by 34% to 275 m −2 and mean total earthworm biomass by 15% to 51 g m −2 overall sampling dates and farms. L. rubellus , A. rosea , and L. terrestris were significantly more abundant overall in NIT than MP. FM and NIT positively affected earthworm species richness and abundances and it is noteworthy that these effects could be observed despite variation in environmental conditions and soil properties between samplings, farms, and crops. Higher top-soil organic matter and less physical disturbance in FM and NIT likely contributed to higher earthworm species richness and abundances. The anecic species L. terrestris (linked to water infiltration and organic matter incorporation) was more abundant in FM, but densities remained very low in arable soil, irrespective of tillage system.

This, together with high input farming practices, has had a deleterious effect on the quality of the rural landscape as a wildlife habitat. This study focuses on green lanes, that is, trackways bounded on both sides by hedgerows, and the adjacent field margins of arable crops and examines each habitat to determine their relative resource value to bumblebees. The vegetation communities within 15 green lane sites and those of the adjacent field margins were recorded, and subsequent analysis showed that species richness was significantly higher within the green lanes. Bee numbers were recorded at each site during 10 visits, both along the inside of green lane hedges and the outside of the opposite hedge on the field margins of the arable crops. At each visit the flower abundance of 10 plant groups was recorded for each habitat type.

Information is needed on how the effectiveness of grass hedges changes over time after planting, and in response to hedge clipping management. Erosion from natural rainfall was measured during 13 yr after establishing single-row (eventually growing to be 1 m wide) miscanthus (Miscanthus sinensis Andersson) hedges at the lower end of erosion plots (21 m long, 5% slope) in a replicated Study involving conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) grown on silt loam soils (Typic Fragiudalfs) in Holly Springs, MS. Sediment yield Values from plots with and without grass hedges were analyzed with reference to the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to determine the conservation support practice (""P"" factor) for sediment yield, which is the fractional reduction in sediment yield due to the presence of the grass hedge. The ""P"" factor of grass hedges was found to be about 0.5 in the establishment year and to decrease progressively with time for CT cotton.

During the first 4 yr of the study, care was taken to conduct tillage is such a way that no soil was thrown into the grass hedge, while during the last 4 yr of the study, primary disk tillage immediately adjacent to the grass hedges created soil berms that acted as low terraces. Hedges reduced the fraction of rainfall that ran off the plots, and hedges with soil berms reduced runoff even more. The runoff curve number (CN) for a 2-yr return period rainfall event was about 78 for plots with no hedges, 70 for plots with hedges, and 61 for plots with hedges with berms. Without berms, 95% of runoff passed through the hedges.

Even though they are an accepted and highly promoted practice, little quantitative data exist on their effectiveness under field conditions. The objective of this research was to determine the amount of nutrients and sediment removed by natural and planted filters. This was achieved by collecting and analyzing runoff at field edges and at various locations in vegetated buffers. Total weight of sediment and nutrients in runoff from North Carolina agricultural fields showed that the grass and riparian filter strips studied reduced runoff load by 50 to 80%. Total sediment decrease through the filters was about 80% for both grass and riparian vegetation. The reduction in the chemical load depended on the nutrient and its form. Filters reduced total P load by 50%, but 80% of the soluble PO4-P arriving at the field edge frequently passed through the Biters. The filters retained 20 to 50% of the NH4 and approximately 50% of the total Kjeldahl N and NO3. High-volume Bows commonly overwhelmed both grass and riparian filters next to cultivated fields. Forested ephemeral channels had little vegetation and were effective sediment sinks during the dry season but were ineffective during large storm events because there was little resistance to Bow. When possible, drainageways should be designed to hold sediment and to disperse the discharge into a riparian area.","1996","2020-10-29 20:08:58","2021-10-19 13:14:38","","246-251","","","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cerotoma trifurcata (Forster) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is a major insect pest of soybean in Nebraska and throughout much of the Midwest. This insect overwinters in the adult stage in litter in wooded areas such as shelterbelts. Historically, crop producers have been unsure of the merits of shelterbelts, especially if nearby crops are more likely to be infested by insect pests as a result. In this study, bean leaf beetle adults were sampled during the season by visually counting the number of beetles found on soybean plants early in the season and by sweep net sampling once plants were at the V4 stage (approximately 0.33 m tall). Sampling was done in 1997 and 1998 at the University of Nebraska Agricultural Research and Development Center in Saunders Co. in east-central Nebraska. Beetle counts were compared between shelterbelt-protected and -unprotected fields. In general, bean leaf beetles were more numerous in 1997 than in 1998 with abundance peaks occurring in late-July and early-September in both years. There were significant differences in bean leaf beetle counts from protected and unprotected fields on only three of the 11 and four of the 13 sampling dates in 1997 and 1998, respectively. On the sampling dates when significant differences were found, two of three in 1997 and three of four in 1998 had higher bean leaf beetle abundance in the protected soybean fields. The results of this study indicate a tendency for more bean leaf beetles in shelterbelt-protected soybean fields when differences are found, but beetle numbers were not significantly different between protected and unprotected fields on the majority of sample dates in the two years of this study. This study also reconfirms the presence of two generations of the bean leaf beetle in Nebraska.","2000","2020-10-29 20:08:59","2021-10-19 13:13:37","","385-390","","","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Glycine max; eppi-reviewer4; Bean leaf beetle; Cerotoma trifurcata; Shelterbelt; Soybean; Windbreak","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The UK Government's Public Service Agreement target seeks to reverse the decline of farmland birds in England by 2020 through the use of AES. The Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) scheme, introduced in 2005, is the first non-competitive, broad-uptake stewardship scheme designed to deliver simple but effective environmental management on farms throughout England. Approximately 5 million hectares of farmland are currently entered into Environmental Stewardship (ES) agreements, and given the scale of this investment it is important to verify the efficacy of ELS as a mechanism for delivering biodiversity benefits. We used spatially referenced ES agreement data to assess the influence of specific management options and combinations of options on farmland bird population changes between 2005 and 2008 derived from standardized surveys carried out on over 2000 lowland farmland 1-km squares in England. The results showed only limited evidence for short-term effects of ES. Only Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra and Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris showed some landscape-specific positive associations with area under ELS management. There was also limited evidence for positive associations between specific management options and the population changes of the species at which they were aimed. The current pattern of option uptake may be limiting benefits of ELS, with boundary management accounting for over 50% of scheme compensation value. However, the time required for option maturation and the time lags in bird population responses to environmental change mean that it is too early to reach definitive conclusions about the success or failure of the scheme. The findings of this study will assist in the development of ELS by feeding into the 5-year review scheduled for 2010 and have implications for the development of similar schemes elsewhere in Europe.","2010","2020-10-29 20:09:00","2021-10-19 13:13:35","","459-474","","","152","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aims: To examine fine-scale habitat associations of farmland birds to determine whether Entry Level Stewardship, the wider countryside agri-environment scheme for England, provides a mechanism for affecting population changes. Methods: Ninety-seven 1-km squares in East Anglia were surveyed to create two-dimensional habitat maps showing the location of all habitat patches and associated stewardship management. Modified territory-mapping techniques were used to produce relative estimates of bird numbers within each discrete habitat patch within each square. The effect of Entry Level Stewardship on species density was then analysed using GLM s. Results: Boundaries managed under Entry Level Stewardship appeared to attract higher densities of Blue Tits, Dunnocks, Common Whitethroats and Yellowhammers. Margins managed under the scheme also had higher densities of Yellowhammers. Conclusions: Existing boundary habitat management under Entry Level Stewardship may provide a mechanism for increasing the populations of some farmland bird species.

Seventeen visits were made between 17 May and 20 July and birds were recorded in the hedges, fields and roadside verges during a standard walk. These records suggested a tendency for the hedgerow nesting species to feed near the edges of fields rather than out in the middle during this period. More birds were seen in the bean, pea and rape crops than in the wheat and the pea field supported an especially large population. Examination of 6 sparrows and 2 Skylarks taken about the end of June showed that these were feeding mainly on beetles and aphids occurring on the crops rather than on soil invertebrates.

The purpose of this study was to determine the fate of NO3 in shallow groundwater moving along a lateral flowpath from a grass seed cropping system through an undisturbed mixed-species herbaceous riparian area. Soil A (30-45 cm) and C horizon (135-150 cm) NO3, dissolved oxygen, and nitrous oxide concentrations were significantly higher in the cropping system than the adjacent riparian area. Nitrate concentrations in both horizons of the riparian soil were consistently at or below 0.05 mg N L-1 while cropping system concentrations ranged from 1 to 12 mg N L-1 Chloride data suggested that NO3 dilution occurred from recharge by precipitation. However, a sharp decrease in NO3/Cl ratios as water moved into the riparian area indicated that additional dilution of NO3 concentrations was unlikely. Riparian area A horizon soil water had higher dissolved organic carbon than the cropping system and when the riparian soil became saturated, available electron acceptors (O-2, NO3) were rapidly reduced. Dissolved inorganic carbon was significantly higher in the riparian area than the cropping system for both horizons indicating high biological activity. Carbon limitation in the cropping system may have led to microbial respiration using primarily 02 and to a lesser degree NO3.

Here, we evaluate the relative contribution of environmental conditions, history of management practices within hedgerows, and adjacent land-use on herb and shrub species distribution in woody hedgerows of agricultural landscapes of southern Quebec, Canada. We pay particular attention to the distribution of forest herbs and weed species and identify the main factors that explain their presence. We also evaluate the amount of spatial structuring in the species data and explanatory variables.Our results show significant differences in species composition related to the unique influence of all sets of factors considered. Adjacent land-use (from intensive crop to fallow land) remains the best predictor of overall species distribution, followed by environmental conditions and history of management practices. The probability of finding forest herbs in hedgerows increases as intensity of adjacent agricultural practices (from intensive crop to fallow land) decreases. Potential weed species, on the other hand, are more likely to be found within narrow hedgerows adjacent to the more intensively managed fields. We discuss the results in terms of the interactions between the different determinants of plant diversity in hedgerows and demonstrate the necessity to distinguish between multiple structuring factors to devise proper conservation strategies. Such strategies will have to take into account the ecological as well as the agricultural exploitation context in which linear features are found to be effective.

In reaction to biodiversity loss, EU policy pursuited the ecologisation and multifunctionality of agriculture. Field margins do pioneering work in the ecologisation of agriculture since they are the interface between intensive farming practices and the wider environment. The presented multidisciplinary study investigates agro-ecological functions (nature conservation, agriculture, environment) and implications of newly created, unfertilised, sown and unsown field margin strips installed on ex-arable land to increase biodiversity. Margin strips were mown twice a year with a late first cut on 15 June and a regrowth cut on 15 September to meet nature conservation purposes. From conservational concern , species diversity on the long term seemed unaffected by the type of plant community that was installed. The decrease in species diversity was more pronounced under a mowing regime without removal of cuttings. The annual addition of mown roadside herbage significantly enhanced species richness. Convergence in vegetation composition between sown and unsown plots occurred in terms of species importance. From agricultural concern , the importance of economically important weeds Elymus repens Gould, Cirsium arvense L. and Urtica dioica Scop. was significantly higher when cuttings were not removed and in the unsown community. Seed dispersal into the adjacent crop was only of importance one year after installation of the margin strips; seedrain was significantly 8 times higher nearby the unsown community than nearby sown communities. The feeding value of herbage from field margin strips was low compared to the feeding value of herbage harvested in agricultural managed fertilized grassland, limiting its use in rations for highly productive livestock. From environmental concern , the reduction of soil mineral N nearby the boundary by the presence of a margin strip was responsable for the increase in abundance of less competitive species and enrichment of species diversity within the semi-natural boundary.","2005","2020-10-29 20:09:06","2020-11-06 22:45:28","","","213-213 p.","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9789059890879","","","","Environmental science; Health and environmental sciences; 0285:Agronomy; Agronomy; Biological sciences; Biodiversity; 0768:Environmental science; eppi-reviewer4; Field margins; Agroecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The experimental factors investigated were location, vegetation and herbage removal. Margin strips were mown twice a year with a late first cut around 15 June and a regrowth cut around 15 September to meet nature conservation objectives. Average DM yield over the first three years was not significantly affected by herbage removal but increased significantly over time, irrespective of vegetation or herbage removal. Initially, sown margin strips significantly outyielded unsown margin strips, but differences in DM yield converged over time. The mid-June cut yielded significantly more than the regrowth cut but its herbage quality was significantly lower. Herbage from the unsown margin strip had a significantly better forage quality than herbage from sown margin strips. Forage quality decreased over time, irrespective of location or vegetation. Changes over time in DM yield and quality were attributed to changes in species composition. The herbage quality of field margins was lower than the herbage quality of intensively managed grassland, limiting its use in rations for highly productive livestock.","2006","2020-10-29 20:09:10","2021-10-19 13:13:44","","37-60","","","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Plant communities in field margins either developed spontaneously or were sown with different seed mixtures of grasses and forbs. Margins were mown twice a year and the cuttings were either removed or left in situ. Three years after establishment, the importance of the unsown rhizomatous species Elytrigia repens and Urtica dioica was significantly higher in the unsown community or when cuttings were not removed after mowing. Seed dispersal from the margin into adjacent crops was important in the unsown community during the first year after establishment. Between 82% and 99% of the seeds were disseminated within 4 m from the margin strip. Overall risk of contaminating the adjacent crop with weeds originating from the field margin strip was concentrated within a few metres of the crop edge. In order to minimise the dissemination of weed species and invasion by noxious vegetatively propagated weeds on nutrient-rich land, it is recommended that field margins are established by sowing and cuttings removed after each cut.

Their effects on biodiversity have been documented at local scales in terms of agricultural practices and management of uncultivated elements, more than at the landscape level. The highest diversity of agricultural landscape structure found in Brittany (France) is characterised by hedgerows surrounding arable fields and permanent grasslands. Some areas did not change much over a few decades, while others were totally transformed by agricultural intensification, field enlargement and removal of hedges. The present paper aimed at examining if this landscape context affected carabid beetles communities in hedgerows. In 11 sites of 1 km(2) each, land use diversity and heterogeneity, hedgerow connectivity and landscape openness were measured. Carabid beetles sampled in hedgerows were identified to species, and grouped in functional units. Multivariate analyses were used to relate the spatial distribution of insects to different parameters of landscape structure. The results show a significant relationship between landscape structure and carabid communities. Forest species were more abundant in dense hedgerow networks with a relatively high ratio of permanent grasslands. Landscape opening induced a shift in species composition; the relative abundance of large species decreased while small, mobile and more ubiquitous species were favoured. Two trajectories of landscape change were identified, which led to different responses in communities, the increase in maize for milk production opening the landscape far more than cereal crops associated with industrial pig or poultry production. Changes were most important in the latter case. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has emerged as a central issue in ecological sciences, but the impact of regarding hedgerow function as a potential source of biological control agents against agricultural pests remains poorly understood. In this paper, we assessed effects of the arthropod community in a neighbouring hedge on the distribution of the pest psylla, Cacopsylla pyri, in a pear orchard over three consecutive years (1999-2001). We measured the diversity of the arthropod community in the hedge and in the orchard at increasing distances from the hedge using Shannon index diversity. Other indices and statistics such the Hellinger and L-1 distances were used to measure dissimilarities between spatial and temporal population distributions patterns. Our results showed in particular a decreasing diversity gradient as distance from the hedge increased and a convergence between predator populations in the orchard and the hedgerow during psylla proliferation. The beneficial arthropod exchanges occurring between the mixed hedgerow and the pear orchard during the pest proliferation period suggested that field border management could be used in an integrated pest management strategy aimed at reducing insecticide use.","2011","2020-10-29 20:09:14","2021-10-19 13:14:15","","75-83","","","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To safeguard this conservation function, insight in the basic organizing principles of hedgerow plant communities is needed. The vegetation composition of 511 individual hedgerows situated within an ancient hedgerow network landscape in Flanders, Belgium was recorded, in combination with a wide range of explanatory variables, including a selection of spatial variables. Non-parametric statistics in combination with multivariate data analysis techniques were used to study the effect of individual explanatory variables. Next, variables were grouped in five distinct subsets and the relative importance of these variable groups was assessed by two related variation partitioning techniques, partial regression and partial canonical correspondence analysis, taking into account explicitly the existence of intercorrelations between variables of different factor groups. Most explanatory variables affected significantly hedgerow species richness and composition. Multivariate analysis showed that, besides adjacent land use, hedgerow management, soil conditions, hedgerow type and origin, the role of other factors such as hedge dimensions, intactness, etc., could certainly not be neglected. Furthermore, both methods revealed the same overall ranking of the five distinct factor groups. Besides a predominant impact of abiotic environmental conditions, it was found that management variables and structural aspects have a relatively larger influence on the distribution of plant species in hedgerows than their historical background or spatial configuration. © 2004 Elsevier SAS.

Population monitoring in such settings reveals substantial edge effects, although these have seldom been quantified. This study compares the abundance of common vole Microtus arvalis (Pallas, 1778) populations at various distances from three types of wooded environment (hedgerow, copse and forest) and in two types of habitat (temporary and permanent grassland). In temporary grassland, substantial edge effects were detected along the boundaries of forests and hedgerows. At 100 m from the forest edge, voles were twice more abundant than at 50 m, four times more than at 25 m and eight times more than at 5 m. In permanent grassland, the edge effect was such that voles were practically absent up to 100 m from the forest edge. For both types of grassland, the edge effect was more pronounced for forest habitat than for hedgerows, that is, for elements with a large surface area of wooded environment. Our results suggest that landscape context may greatly affect the local abundance of voles. Given the considerable damage done by M. arvalis, the presence of wooded patches in grassland areas leads to lower vole densities in adjacent areas and this might be an alternative method to control M. arvalis as a pest species.","2009","2020-10-29 20:09:15","2021-10-19 13:14:10","","51-60","","","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is of particular concern in agricultural landscapes, which combine increased levels of fragmentation with larger numbers of endangered species than other landscapes. Corridors (e.g. linear landscape elements) are a popular conservation strategy to counteract fragmentation effects. Grassy field margins (GFMs) have been established throughout Europe as part of agri-environmental schemes. The primary goal of these measures is to protect water quality, but it is suggested biodiversity may benefit via a corridor function; Being set up along watercourses, GFMs may spontaneously form a coherent network of corridors in agricultural landscapes. We tested this hypothesis by monitoring movement strategies of Meadow brown butterflies (Maniola jurtina L.) in GFMs. Results indicated that butterfly movement was facilitated by this new landscape element, supporting its corridor function. Mechanistically, dispersal occurred through foraging movements rather than movements adapted to dispersal. Spatial configurations of GFMs were also explored in a large agricultural area and demonstrated that the GFM policy is adequate to provide a corridor function. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Perennials predominated in flora of boundary strips and bush communities. Mainly annual (40%) and biennial (15%) species comprise the flora of fallows. A great number of bee taxons represent meadow, segetal or ruderal communities. Most of flow plants compose loose patches, but their successive blooming ensures a source of food for Apoidea from early spring till the end of summer.

Field margins are common linear structures in the agricultural landscape. In the present study, we evaluated the factors that exert an impact on the forage flora composition and on the diversity in field margins. The study was conducted in the 2010 - 2011 time period across the agricultural landscape on the Lublin Upland of SE Poland. Data on the forage flora were obtained while making floristic charts along 45 transect plots x 300 m; the total length being 13500 m. Multivariate ordination techniques (PCA and RDA) were employed to analyse forage-flora characteristics. Field margins represent valuable refuge areas for forage-species richness, but not for the abundance of forage species. On field margins, forage-species diversity benefits from the location of natural habitats (forests or meadows), primarily if the distance from these habitats is < 1000 m or the field acreage is < 10 ha. The shift from heterogeneous habitats to a more homogeneous landscape causes a reduction of forage floral diversity. Due to lack of dense forage-species patches, the promotion of sowing nectariferous and/or polleniferous species seems to be a reasonable management method to enhance the quantitative food niche on field margins and to support the conservation of pollinators in the areas surrounding farms.","2015","2020-10-29 20:09:17","2020-10-29 20:09:17","","27-37","","","59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vegetation cover was manipulated within enclosures on a field boundary in southern England to test experimentally the effect on the overwintering of Tachyporus hypnorum and Demetrias atricapillus populations, species that use grassy boundaries of arable fields as refugia during winter. 2. Winter survival was lowest for beetles enclosed on bare earth and highest for those enclosed on tussocks of Dactylis glomerata. The contrast in structural complexity of the experimental treatments caused a 44%, 43% and 36% variation in the final densities of beetles during three successive winters. 3. The densities of T. hypnorum on adjacent field boundaries were estimated from the composition of their vegetation cover and the survival rates of the beetles on different treatments. There was no significant difference between the number of T. hypnorum allocated to seven field boundaries by the model and the number of beetles sampled from soil and vegetation of those boundaries at the end of winter. 4. The cover of boundaries by non-tussock grass species accounted for 91% of the predicted overwintering numbers of T hypnorum because tussock grasses and bare soil were not common on existing boundaries. We therefore considered the influence of boundary structure on the overwintering of the beetles. 5. Higher winter densities of T. hypnorum were sampled from boundaries with deeper soil and greater vegetation height, that were wider and higher above the field level, with an east to west orientation, warmer mean daytime temperature and lower soil moisture. 6. A quadrat survey was carried out in Norway on the equivalent group to T. hypnorum that comprised T. hypnorum, T. chrysomelinus and T. obtusus. With multiple regression, more individuals of Tachyporus spp. and other beneficial arthropods occurred in sampling units from boundaries raised higher above the field level that comprised grass cover with a high proportion of tussock grass. 7. Other factors such as pre-winter crop husbandry, food supply and parasitism may affect the dispersal power, habitat selection and cold hardiness of beneficial arthropod species within available boundaries and account for the observed variation in beetle numbers.","1994","2020-10-29 20:09:19","2020-10-29 20:09:19","","361-370","","","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we use rRNA 16S gene sequencing to assess both the level of parasitism by Aphidiinae primary parasitoids and parasitoid identity on a large sample of aphids collected in cultivated and uncultivated agricultural habitats in Western France. We used these data to construct ecological networks to assess the level of compartmentalization between aphid and parasitoid food webs of cultivated and uncultivated habitats. We evaluated the extent to which uncultivated margins provided a resource for parasitoids shared between pest and nonpest aphids. We compared the observed quantitative ecological network described by our molecular approach to an empirical qualitative network based on aphid-parasitoid interactions from traditional rearing data found in the literature. We found that the molecular network was highly compartmentalized and that parasitoid sharing is relatively rare between aphids, especially between crop and noncrop compartments. Moreover, the few cases of putative shared generalist parasitoids were questionable and could be due to the lack of discrimination of cryptic species or from intraspecific host specialization. Our results suggest that apparent competition mediated by Aphidiinae parasitoids is probably rare in agricultural areas and that the contribution of field margins as a source of these biocontrol agents is much more limited than expected. Further large-scale (spatial and temporal) studies on other crops and noncrop habitats are needed to confirm this.

Soil samples were taken twice: in the autumn and spring from the centre of each shelterbelt, from the ecotone, and in the field at a distance of 15 and 50 m from the edge of the shelterbelts. The density of nematode communities fluctuated unpredictably, in autumn it was very low and ranged from 276 to 641×103, in spring it ranged from 388 to 1931 × 103 individuals per 1 m2. Most numerous trophic groups were: bacterivores, fungivores and obligate plant feeders, while facultative plant feeders, omnivores and predators achieved low level. The abundance of predators in older shelterbelt was significantly (P ≤0.05) higher than that in the younger one and decreased with increasing distance from the shelterbelt towards the field. The communities in shelterbelt and its ecotone were more diverse, which was reflected by the higher number of genera (19-31) and higher values of Shannon-Wiener diversity index H′ (3.3-4.0), than those in the fields where the number of genera ranged from 15 to 25 and Shannon-Wiener diversity index H′ ranged from 2.5 to 3.5. In the younger shelterbelt and in the control field the soil food-web assessed with indices derived from analysis of nematode communities was considered as composed mainly of basal components, i.e. cosmopolitan species feeding on bacteria and fungi occurring everywhere even in degraded environments. While the food web in older shelterbelt was consisted mainly of enrichment components, i.e. bacteria feeding species of very short life cycle, with high food requirements which occur in the environment rich in bacteria). The values of Channel Index which informs about the predominant pathway of decomposition (through bacteria or fungi) showed that in majority of sites bacterial processes predominated. Only in the older shelterbelt the participation of fungal decomposition channel was higher (&gt;50%) and increased with increasing distance from the shelterbelt towards the centre of the field. The results of Correspondence Analysis showed that first two axis explained 40.3% of the variance. The generic composition of nematode communities in the 11-years old shelterbelt differed from that in the 6-years old shelterbelt. Nematode communities inhabiting the ecotone of younger shelterbelt were very similar to the communities in the shelterbelt, while the communities in ecotone of older shelterbelt differed from those in the shelterbelts. Nematode communities inhabiting the control field were similar to those inhabiting the field adjacent to younger shelterbelt.","2007","2020-10-29 20:09:23","2021-10-19 13:14:28","","665-680","","","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most lost nutrient is nitrogen yet the phosphorus from soluble fertilizers is also lost. These nutrients reach into surface waters where determine eutrophication phenomenon. In order to implement the objectives of Water Frame Directive 2000/60/CE there have been searched methods for mitigation the nutrient pollution from slope soils. These methods are: - the using of organic - mineral fertilizers (L120) instead of soluble phosphorus fertilizers (superphosphates); - buffer strips at the bottom of the slope;- filtering materials for water from creeks. The applying of these methods have contributed to the reduction of the nutrient losses (nitrogen and phosphorus) from slope soils with values ranging between 38-41% by applying organic - mineral fertilizer and by 52-64% when buffer strips were installed. The using of straw ballots as filtering materials for creek water has determined the reduction of nutrient losses by 72%. This way, the using of organic - mineral fertilizer on lignite base (L-120) has determined the diminishing of phosphorus losses on slope soils due to bonding phosphorus from this fertilizer in an organic - mineral matrix that speeds up the retrogradation and solubilisation processes of phosphorus. The using of grass buffer strips of 10 m wide on level curves at the bottom of the slope along Preajba creek has determined an obvious decreasing of the eroded soil quantity, of humus and nutrient losses due to better retention by root system and its higher density. Straw ballots across the course of a creek are a good filter for running waters. The straw action is similar with soil colloidal complex, they retain chemical ions from water like: NO3, NH4, K, PO4, etc. By using straw ballots there can be avoided the eutrophication phenomenon of the surface waters. The using of crops like natural and sown pasture as well as cereals could be a method to mitigate nutrient losses on slopes. Wide row crops should be avoided as much as possible.

Disturbance and grassland butterfly guilds were generally not suitable surrogates for grassland bird metrics, non-grassland bird metrics, or nest density metrics. Butterflies did have consistent positive correlations with plant species richness and forb metrics, as well as consistent negative correlations with grass metrics, but these correlations were generally smaller than what is considered suitable to serve as surrogates.

Although agricultural intensification has led to a scarcity of native grassland habitats within most agricultural landscapes of North America, fragmented remnants and semi-natural habitats may support diverse communities, including butterflies, as long as vital resources such as host plants are available. The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Conservation Reserve Program practice CP33 Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds (USDA 2004) provides semi-natural grassland habitat in agricultural landscapes, but a knowledge gap exists about impacts of prescribed disturbance (e.g. burning or disking) on butterflies. We monitored butterfly habitat and butterfly communities on experimentally manipulated CP33 grassland buffers in Clay County, Mississippi from 2007 to 2009. Disturbance guild butterfly species richness did not differ among treatments. However, disturbance guild abundance was positively affected by disking in both the first and second growing seasons following disking, and the magnitude of this response varied between years. Effects of burning on disturbance guild abundance did not differ from the control treatment. There were no treatment differences for grassland guild butterfly abundance and species richness suggesting that periodic disturbance does not unduly impact grassland-associated butterflies in the southeastern US. Our results support current USDA practice standards that require periodic disturbance during the 10-year contract, but restrict the disturbance to 1/3 or 1/4 of grassland buffer area in a given year.","2013","2020-10-29 20:09:25","2021-10-19 13:13:52","","577-590","","","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The variation in taxonomic composition, community attributes and trophic structure of fish assemblages from streams under different riparian zone preservation conditions were studied. Nine stream reaches under the following riparian vegetation conditions were selected: Native Forest (NF), with mostly primary forest; Secondary Forest (SF), which included sites with vegetation in an advanced stage of regeneration surrounded by sugarcane plantations; and Sugarcane sites (SC), located in areas without riparian vegetation, adjacent to sugarcane crops. Forty-one species were collected. The variance partitioning and partial Redundancy Analysis (pRDA) indicated that community composition and trophic structure were significantly explained by riparian condition and spatial variations, while diversity, richness, abundance and biomass were only explained by season and space, with higher diversity and richness at the SF sites. Abundance-Biomass curves (ABC curves) suggested that sugarcane plantations destabilized fish assemblages, especially at the more intensively managed sites, which seem to influence stream integrity and associated fish fauna. We concluded that both physical conditions of streams and some attributes of fish communities reflected the different levels of preservation of the riparian buffers, but given the influence of regional processes which have a pervasive role in shaping local assemblages, land use at the watershed scale seemed to be important especially to explain the higher richness and diversity found at the SF sites.","2015","2020-10-29 20:09:26","2020-10-29 20:09:26","","1895-1912","","","98","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main objectives of this study were to: 1) determine if effectiveness of a filter strip changes over years since establishment, and 2) determine if temporal change depends on vegetation type. Four vegetation treatments were replicated five times in 3 x 7.5 M (10 X 25 ft) Plots. Plots containing all-grass (New Grass) and grass with trees and shrubs (New Forest) were established in spring Of 1995 among otherwise similar plots that contained either grass since ca. 1970 (Old Grass) or were re-cultivated and re-ptanted annually with grain sorghum (Crop). Once each summer, in 1995, 1996, 1997, 2003, and 2004, identically prepared solutions containing sediment, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer, and bromide tracer were applied to the upper end of each plot during a simulated rainfall event Of 2.5 cm (1 in) in 30 minutes, and the load and concentration of runoff components were measured in outflow from the plots. Retention of solution components and reduction of their concentrations by the New Grass and New Forest plots improved from effectiveness similar or less than the Crop plots to effectiveness similar to the Old Grass plots within three growing seasons. Improvement coincided with the development of denser vegetative ground cover and a slower rate of runoff flow through the plots. Change in infiltration accounted for most of the improvement in overall effectiveness. There was no evidence of divergence in the performance of New Grass and New Forest plots. We conclude that filter strip performance improves over a period of years since establishment. Most of the change occurs within three growing seasons after establishment. Infiltration characteristics account for most of that change. Grass and forest vegetation are equally effective as filter strips for at least 10 growing seasons after establishment.","2007","2020-10-29 20:09:26","2021-10-19 13:13:39","","21-32","","","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A geographic information system (GIS)-based tool was developed and tested that employs terrain analysis to account for spatially nonuniform runoff and produce more effective filter strip designs. The computer program, AgBufferBuilder, runs with ArcGIS versions 10.0 and 10.1 (Esri, Redlands, California) and uses digital elevation models to identify detailed spatial patterns of overland runoff to field margins. The tool then sizes filter dimensions according to those patterns using buffer area ratio relationships. The resulting design is larger along segments where more runoff flows and smaller along segments where runoff is less and delivers a constant level of trapping efficiency around the field margin for sediment and sediment-bound pollutants. The tool also can estimate trapping efficiency of existing filter strips or hypothetical configurations. In a validation test, estimates of sediment trapping efficiency using the tool's assessment function compared closely to measurements taken on large field plots in central Iowa. Using AgBufferBuilder, designs developed for a sample of fields in the midwestern United States were estimated to trap nearly double the sediment, on average, during a design storm than constant-width configurations having equivalent total filter area. AgBufferBuilder can be used to bolster environmental performance of filter strips where runoff is spatially nonuniform.

Uncropped field margins are important foraging habitats on farmland for many declining bird species and are a key component of Agri-Environment Schemes across Europe. Maximizing the value of foraging habitats requires detailed knowledge of the factors influencing habitat selection and food availability. 2. We firstly conducted an observational study of foraging habitat selection by breeding yellowhammers Emberiza citrinella L. on lowland mixed farmland, in relation to underlying invertebrate and vegetation characteristics. 3. There was a clear seasonal shift in the relative use of field margins and cereal crops. Margins were used less than crops in late summer, despite supporting higher invertebrate abundance relative to cereals. Seasonal increases in vegetation height were most marked in margins, suggesting the seasonal decline in margin use may reflect reduced food accessibility. 4. In the second phase of the study, field margins were cut experimentally to create short, open patches within taller margin swards. The use of cut patches by foraging yellowhammers increased significantly between early and late summer, and patches were used more frequently with increasing height of adjacent uncut margin. These findings strongly support the theory that tall vegetation reduces margin accessibility in late summer. 5. Synthesis and applications. Provision of invertebrate-rich field margins is a core component of Agri-Environment Schemes, but current prescriptions may result in them having limited value in late summer. More effective management, such as more frequent cutting, may be required to maximize the benefits for foraging birds by creating short, open vegetation patches. Measures to increase accessibility to invertebrates on farmland are likely to benefit a range of bird species across a variety of crop types.

Lower amounts of pesticides leached through grass-cover soil columns (2.7-24.3% of the initial amount) than the bare soil columns (8.0-55.1%), in correspondence with their sorption coefficients. Diuron was recovered in higher amounts in leachates (8.9-32.2%) than tebuconazole (2.7-12.9%), in agreement with their sorption coefficients. However, despite having a sorption coefficient similar to that of diuron, more procymidone was recovered in the leachates (10.2-55.1%), probably due to its facilitated transport by dissolved organic matter. Thus even in this very permeable soil, higher organic matter contents associated with grass-cover reduce the amount of pesticide leaching and limit the risk of groundwater contamination by the pesticides.

Recent studies have also stressed the importance of the landscape scale in the conservation of butterflies in small fragmented habitats. In this paper, we examine data from a variety of sources and conclude that the importance of shelter in open landscapes may be underestimated since recording is often restricted to the optimum conditions suggested by the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme. In less favourable conditions, butterflies may place greater reliance on those components of the landscape offering shelter. In light of the current policy of agricultural de-intensification we discuss how modifications to our current landscapes could benefit a wide range of species. © 1997 Chapman & Hall.","1997","2020-10-29 20:09:29","2020-10-29 20:09:29","","89-97","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this paper is to describe and illustrate the use of a newly developed field-based evaluation tool for riparian buffer zones in agricultural catchments. The Buffer Zone Inventory and Evaluation Form (BZIEF) incorporates criteria-based scoring systems developed from literature review, subsequent peer-review, and then a pilot field study. Use of the BZIEF is demonstrated by comparing buffer zones in three catchments established for water quality and habitat improvement under the Water Fringe Option agrienvironment scheme in England in order to assess whether the buffers were likely to provide environmental enhancement. Results among the three catchments were generally similar; buffer zones scored highly for their abundant vegetation cover, lack of erosion, stream habitat quality, and sufficient width. Furthermore, previous grassland or arable land use did not substantially affect buffer zone ratings. However, the BZIEF indicated that inappropriate soil characteristics in one catchment were likely to constrain buffer zone effectiveness for improving water quality. In another catchment, poor riparian vegetation diversity and structure may yield ineffective habitat enhancement, according to the BZIEF. It was concluded that the BZIEF might be a useful tool for buffer zone comparison and monitoring, even though more work is needed to test and validate the method. For example, the BZIEF could be used to target appropriate locations for buffer zones and is flexible, so could be adapted for different policies, objectives and regions.","2003","2020-10-29 20:09:31","2021-10-19 13:13:59","","252-267","","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effect of controlled drainage and riparian buffers as best management practices to reduce the loss of agricultural nonpoint source nitrogen from the middle coastal plain has not been well documented. The middle coastal plain is characterized by intensive agriculture on sandy soils with deeply incised or channelized streams. A 2-year study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of controlled drainage, riparian buffers, and a combination of both in the middle coastal plain of North Carolina. It was hypothesized that raising the water table near the ditch would enhance nitrate-nitrogen reduction through denitrification. On the sandy Soils Studied, controlled drainage did not effectively raise the water table near the ditch to a greater degree than observed on the free drainage treatment. Due to random treatment location, the free drainage treatment was installed along a ditch with a shallower impermeable layer compared to the impermeable layer on the controlled drainage treatments (2 m versus 3- to 4-m deep). This resulted in a perched or higher water table on the free drainage treatment. Over 17 storm events, the riparian buffer (free drainage) treatment had an average groundwater table depth of 0.92 in compared to 0.96 and 1.45 in for the combination (riparian buffer and controlled drainage) and controlled drainage treatments, respectively. Nitrate concentration decrease between the field wells and ditch edge wells averaged 29% (buffer only), 63% (buffer and controlled drainage), and 73% (controlled drainage only). Although apparently more nitrate was removed from the groundwater on the controlled drainage treatments, the controlled drainage treatment water table near the ditch was not raised closer to the ground surface compared to the free drainage treatment. Nitrate removal effectiveness was attributed to local soil and landscape properties, Such as denitrification in deeper reduced zones of the soil profile.","2003","2020-10-29 20:09:32","2021-10-19 13:14:17","","82-92","","","129","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The legislation mandates 10-m and 20-m buffers, respectively, for moderate sloped (i.e. <5%) and steep sloped (i.e. >5%) agricultural fields that border streams. Since 2001, Environment Canada has been evaluating the effectiveness of various buffer widths on operational farms in reducing toxicity and contaminant concentrations in runoff. Sample collectors, placed in 44 fields at the field edge (0m), 10m and at distances out to 30m, collected overland flow following rainfall-induced runoff events. Samples were collected within 24 hours of an event and analysed for seven pesticides (endosulfan, chlorothalonil, carbofuran, linuron, metribuzin, metalaxyl, mancozeb), water quality parameters and Daphnia magna toxicity. The 10-m buffer required for moderate sloped fields was effective at reducing contaminant concentrations but not always to less than lethal concentrations to Daphnia magna. Limited data beyond 10m for fields of both slope types precluded making recommendations on a suitable buffer width for shallow sloped fields and evaluating the effectiveness of 20-m buffers for steep sloped fields. When paired data were combined and statistically tested for all fields, the studied pesticides underwent a 52-98% and 68-100% reduction in aqueous and particulate concentrations within 10m and 30m, respectively. In addition, by 10m, soluble phosphorus, nitrate-nitrogen and total suspended solids were reduced by 34%, 38% and 64%, respectively. Results suggest buffer zones on operational farms are capable of achieving contaminant reductions comparable to those reported for controlled experiments. Inconsistent siting of sample collectors beyond 10m limited the evaluation of the effects of field slope and buffer width on buffer effectiveness on working farms. Future studies on buffer efficiency on operational farms should focus on building the data set beyond 10m and evaluating load reductions.

Winter is a season of highest concentration of birds and hunting pressure but woodcock precise habitat requirements are poorly known. It is crucial to assess threats and to develop sustainable management options for the conservation of woodcock populations. During three consecutive winters, we monitored 65 individual woodcocks fitted with radio-tags in Brittany, France. Habitat selection was analysed using GIS and compositional analysis, in relation to vegetation types, soil variables (humus types) and the abundance of their main prey (earthworms). Woodcocks used different habitats diurnally and nocturnally, generally preferring areas with high earthworm biomass. Diurnal habitat selection in forests was associated with humus type (preference for mulls, rich in earthworms) and dense shrub strata (better protection). Hedges with a high density of trees and shrub were also important habitat. At night, grazed meadows were the preferred habitat, containing five times higher biomass of earthworms compared to cultivated fields. Sustainable management of populations requires protection and management of habitats that incorporates food and cover. Forestry practices should preserve rich humus types and coppices by choosing tree species that ameliorate the soil and soil tilling. Changes in landscapes and intensive agricultural practices are current threats to woodcock populations: destruction of hedges, decrease of permanent grazed meadows, impoverishment of soils fauna biomasses from ploughing and chemical applications. However, woodcocks may benefit from the recent development of set-asides, grass field-borders and simplified farm practices (no-tillage and direct sowing).

The within-field distribution of adult E, terebrans was sampled in 1991 and 1992 by placing malaise traps near a wooded edge, near an herbaceous edge, and in the field interior in each of 4 fields of corn, Zea mays L. During the 1st generation of 1991, significantly more females were captured in wooded-edge traps than in herbaceous-edge or interior traps. In the Ist generation of 1992, more females were again captured in wooded-edge traps in 2 fields, whereas in the other 2 fields, more were captured in both herbaceous-edge and wooded-edge traps than interior traps. In the 2nd generation of both years, there was no consistent pattern of distribution of adult females among sites. The distribution pattern of adult females among fields was not consistently correlated with the distribution of O. nubilalis larvae or percentage parasitism. Overall, fen er males were captured than females, and in the Ist generation of both years, more males were captured near wooded edges of cornfields in which the previous crop had been corn, than any other sites. Both male and female E, terebrans were captured in malaise traps at the interface of a woodlot canopy and a cornfield with capture zones from 1 to 4.3 m high. We propose that E. terebrans distribution in cornfields is influenced by resources such as sugar and a moderate microclimate present in adjacent woodlots but unavailable in early-season cornfields. Perennial noncrop habitats may play an important role in conservation of natural enemies for biological control.","1997","2020-10-29 20:09:34","2021-10-19 13:14:11","","924-932","","","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://www.crossref.org/openurl?pid=zoteroDOI@wiernik.org&url_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fzotero.org%3A2&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=Influence%20of%20noncrop%20habitats%20on%20the%20distribution%20of%20Eriborus%20terebrans%20(Hymenoptera%3A%20Ichneumonidae)%20in%20cornfields&rft.jtitle=Environmental%20Entomology&rft.volume=26&rft.aufirst=L.%20E.&rft.aulast=Dyer&rft.au=L.%20E.%20Dyer&rft.au=D.%20A.%20Landis&rft.date=1997&rft.pages=924-932&rft.spage=924&rft.epage=932&rft.issn=0046-225X","eppi-reviewer4","❓ Multiple DOI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The CERES-Maize and CROPGRO-Soybean, two of the main crop growth models incorporated into the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), were developed to simulate the effects of environmental conditions, different management strategies, and genetics on crop growth and development. These models currently do not have an option for calculating erosion and phosphorus (P) dynamics. In this study, the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) and sediment-bound P model were incorporated into CERES-Maize and CROPGRO-Soybean models. The evapotranspiration component of the CERES model was also evaluated to test the ability of the model to simulate the effects of shelterbelts on corn transpiration. Two years of sap flow data collected from corn plants in a sheltered (3H) and unsheltered (25H) areas in a field near Ogden, Iowa, were used for model testing. Results showed that the CERES-Maize model simulated daily plant transpiration well in both sheltered and unsheltered areas with RMSE of 0.53mm d -1 (3H) and 0.75mm d-1 (25H) in 2001, and 0.85mm d-1 (3H) and 0.59mm d-1 (25H) in 2002. Average coefficient of determination (r2 ) for 2001 and 2002 was 0.90 and 0.73, respectively. After erosion and sediment-bound P subroutines were incorporated into CERES-Maize and CROPGRO-Soybean, the models were calibrated and tested using five years of data collected from two field sites in a watershed in Tama County, Iowa. Results showed that generally both models tended to over or underpredict daily sediment and sediment-bound P losses from fields, but they simulated seasonal values reasonably well. For CERES model, the error between simulated and measured seasonal sediment losses was less than 10% in three out of the five years, while in four out of the five years, the difference between simulated and measured sediment loss was less than 15% for the CROPGRO. The study indicated that both models did not seem to give good estimates of daily sediment and P losses, but they can be used to simulate the long-term (seasonal) losses with reasonable accuracy.","2004","2020-10-29 20:09:35","2020-10-29 20:09:35","","","159-159 p.","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over a period of 3 years, slugs were sampled in three regions in northern Switzerland in late spring using bait stations.

Grass hedges may reduce runoff losses of nutrients and sediment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of narrow switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) hedges (-0.75 m wide) on the transport of P and N from a field receiving beef cattle feedlot manure under tilled and no-till conditions. This study was conducted on a steep (12% average slope) Monona silt loam fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls) soil near Treynor, Iowa. The experiment was a split-plot with no-till and disked systems as main plots and subplots of manure, fertilizer, and check with or without a grass hedge. A rainfall simulator was used and runoff was collected from both the initial and the following wet simulations. Only 38% of the no-till plots and 63% of disked plots had any runoff during the initial 6.4 cm hr -1 water application. A single narrow grass hedge reduced runoff concentrations of dissolved P (DP) by 47%, bioavailable P (BAP) by 48%, particulate P (PP) by 38%, total P (TP) by 40%, and NH 4-N by 60% during the wet simulation on the no-till plots receiving manure, compared with similar plots with no hedges. The corresponding reductions in concentrations as a result of a grass hedge for DP, BAP, PP, TP, and NH 4-N on the disked plots were 21, 29, 43, 38, and 52%, respectively. Runoff NH 4-N concentration from fertilizer applied to the disked plots was reduced by 61%, NO 3-N by 21%, and total N (TN) by 27% during the wet simulation when grass hedges were used. Grass hedges also reduced total quantities of DP, BAP, TP, and NH 4-N during the wet simulation. The TP loss was 3.3% of applied fertilizer and was 0.3% of applied manure P. Narrow grass hedges were effective in reducing P and N losses in runoff from both manure and fertilizer application.","2000","2020-10-29 20:09:36","2021-10-19 13:14:28","","172-176","","","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whether local species richness is dependent on local or landscape factors can be assessed by examining the relationship between local and landscape species richness. Here we studied how local species richness is related to landscape-level species richness in landscapes differing in agricultural intensity. The relationship was linear for field boundaries in intensively cultivated landscapes and non-linear in less-intensively cultivated landscapes. In landscapes containing semi-natural grasslands (on average 4% of overall land-use), the relationship was non-linear for field boundaries, but linear when considering local species richness of the grasslands themselves. These results show that local factors are more important than landscape factors in determining local species richness in landscapes which contained semi-natural grasslands. Local species richness was limited by landscape factors in intensively cultivated landscapes. This interpretation was supported by the relationship between local species richness and landscape-scale average mobility and generalist percentage of butterfly assemblages. We conclude that the management of field boundary habitat quality for butterflies is expected to be most effective in landscapes with semi-natural grasslands, the species composition of which in turn is dependent on the regional occurrence of grasslands. Based on our results, managing non-crop habitats for the conservation of habitat specialists and species with poor mobility will be most efficient in regions where patches of semi-natural grasslands occur.","2012","2020-10-29 20:09:37","2021-10-19 13:14:19","","232-238","","","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Organic farming did not show any significant effects on lepidopteran diversity. The results suggested that a successful conservation strategy for lepidopterans occurring in boreal agroecosystems depend on proper management of field boundaries, irrespective of farming regime. As bumblebee diversity tended to be higher at organic plots it is concluded that these important pollinators might be able to react on even small changes in habitat quality of cultivated lands.

Bulk density, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus within 30-m riparian buffer strips adjacent to recent settlement land use areas were similar to those of the gazetted forest reference condition, but only bulk density of the buffer strips adjacent to peri-urban and commercial agriculture land use areas were similar to the gazetted forest reference condition.

However, these schemes require evaluation to estimate their efficiency, for further consolidation and improvement. The establishment of grassy strips along watercourses represents a measure of cross-compliance introduced in France in 2005. In this study, we analyzed the benefits of these new landscape elements for biodiversity, by (i) exploring the plant community composition of grassy strips in relation to their landscape context, (ii) analyzing the faunal communities of three major functional groups (i.e., small mammals, syrphids, and carabid beetles) present in grassy strips of agroecosystems, (iii) comparing the faunal biodiversity to that observed in other habitats of agroecosystems, such as fields and hedgerows, and (iv) investigating the relationships between faunal community indices and grassy strip properties. The results of our study showed that the plant community of grassy strips is mainly influenced by semi-natural habitats that are present within a landscape context, i.e., at a scale >500m. We found that grassy strips do not necessarily present areas of particularly high animal biodiversity compared to other habitats (i.e., fields and hedgerows). However, the properties of these strips (i.e., length, width and plant biodiversity) influence the structure of faunal communities. Two years after the establishment of grassy strips, their role as ecotones between previous field margins (mostly hedgerows in our study site) is illustrated through the response of the fauna. Hence, grassy strips, being more stable than cultivated fields, contribute to a new refuge within the agroecosystem landscape.

Aims: To test if foraging Swallows select vegetated field boundaries in preference to field centres, if selection is influenced by weather conditions and local habitat type, and if patterns of selection are explained by differences in food availability between the two habitats. Methods: Data were collected from paired vegetated field boundaries and field centres in lowland mixed farmland during good and bad weather conditions. The maximum number of foraging Swallows, total foraging time, food availability and local habitat type (adjacent crop type, presence/absence of boundary trees and boundary height) were recorded. Results: Foraging Swallows selected vegetated boundaries in bad weather and there was a non-significant trend towards selection during good weather. Hedgerow use increased significantly when the adjacent field was winter wheat, rather than grazed grass. Hedgerows containing trees were used more during good weather, but the strength of the effect is less than that of crop type. The habitat types selected by foraging Swallows were almost always those where measured food availability was the highest. Conclusion: Vegetated field boundaries are an important foraging habitat for Swallows and support higher prey densities than field centres, especially when adjacent fields are arable. The loss of hedgerows from agricultural areas, particularly arable ones, may have reduced the quality of farmland as Swallow foraging habitat. An increase in hedgerows and the number of hedgerow trees may improve the quality of farmland as foraging habitat, especially in arable-dominated areas. The effects of this on breeding success and subsequent population trends should be assessed.","2003","2020-10-29 20:09:40","2021-10-19 13:14:40","","8-14","","","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compared northern bobwhite covey densities on 1,088 paired row-crop fields with and without native herbaceous buffers in 13 states during autumn, 2006-2008. We used a 2-stage random effects modeling approach that incorporates the effective area as an offset in generalized linear mixed models to assess regional relationships among autumn bobwhite covey densities and covariates of field type (i.e., fields with vs. without native herbaceous buffers), ecological region, year, survey week, and contracted vegetative cover (i.e., planting native grasses and forbs vs. establishing through natural regeneration). Covey density was correlated with year and interaction effects of field type and ecological region. The year effect suggested annual variation in covey densities, whereas the field type by ecological region interaction suggested covey response to buffers was dependent on spatial location, likely reflecting differences in buffer establishment, succession, and characteristics of the surrounding landscape among regions. Mean fitted covey density on fields across all survey sites was 0.047 (±0.008 bootstrap standard error [BSE]) and 0.031 coveys/ha (±0.003 BSE) on row-crop fields with and without herbaceous buffers, respectively. Covey density was greater on fields with buffers relative to matched, comparison fields without buffers in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (241%; P < 0.001) and both the eastern (123%; P < 0.001) and western (60%; P = 0.01) portions of the Southeastern Coastal Plain region. Covey density was an order of magnitude greater in the central Texas region compared to other regions, but exhibited a small response to native herbaceous buffers, as did density of coveys in the Eastern Tallgrass Prairie and Central Hardwoods regions. Disproportionate response to buffers in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley and Southeastern Coastal Plain suggests native herbaceous habitats might be limiting during autumn in these regions, whereas lack of response in the Eastern Tallgrass Prairie, Central Hardwoods, and central Texas regions suggests that herbaceous habitat either was not limiting or buffers failed to provide adequate requirements for bobwhites during autumn. Selection of other habitats to meet security and thermoregulatory needs might have resulted in lack of response in these regions. Native herbaceous cover provided by buffers can provide critical habitat in row-crop agricultural systems in some regions, and can contribute to regional population recovery objectives of the Northern Bobwhite Conservation Initiative (NBCI). However, range-wide NBCI recovery objectives will best be met through multiple conservation practices in row-crop agricultural systems. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

However, effectiveness of targeted conservation actions across broader landscapes is poorly understood. We evaluated multiregion, multispecies avian densities on row-crop fields with native grass field margins (i.e., buffers) as part of the first U.S. agricultural conservation practice designed to support habitat and population recovery objectives of a national wildlife conservation initiative. We coordinated breeding season point transect surveys for 6 grassland bird species on 1151 row-crop fields with and without native grass buffers (9-37 m) in 14 U.S. states (10 ecoregions) from 2006 to 2011. In most regions, breeding season densities of 5 of 6 targeted bird species were greater in the 500-m surrounding survey points centered on fields with native grass buffers than in landscapes without buffers. Relative effect sizes were greatest for Northern Bobwhite ( Colinus virginianus), Dickcissel ( Spiza americana), and Field Sparrow ( Spizella pusilla) in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley and Eastern Tallgrass Prairie regions. Other species (e.g., Eastern Meadowlark [ Sturnella magna], Grasshopper Sparrow [ Ammodramus savannarum]) exhibited inconsistent relative effect sizes. Bird densities on fields with and without buffers were greatest in the Central Mixed-grass Prairie region. Our results suggest that strategic use of conservation buffers in regions with the greatest potential for relative density increases in target species will elicit greater range-wide population response than diffuse, uninformed, and broadly distributed implementation of buffers. We recommend integrating multiple conservation practices in broader agricultural landscapes to maximize conservation effectiveness for a larger suite of species.

Evaluamos la densidad multiregión y multiespecie de aves en campos de cultivos en hilera con márgenes de pastizal nativo (es decir, amortiguadores) como parte de la primera práctica de conservación agrícola en los EUA, diseñada para apoyar a los objetivos de recuperación de hábitat y de población de una iniciativa nacional de conservación de vida silvestre.

En la mayoría de las regiones, las densidades de temporada de reproducción de 5 de las 6 especies objetivo fueron mayores en los 500 m alrededor de los puntos de muestreo centrados en los campos con amortiguadores de pastizal nativo que en los terrenos sin amortiguadores. Los tamaños de efecto relativo fueron mayores para Colinus virginianus, Spiza americana y Spizella pusilla en las regiones del Valle Aluvial del Mississippi y la Pradera Oriental de Hierbas Altas. Otras especies (p. ej.: Sturnella magna y Ammodramus savannarum) exhibieron tamaños de efecto relativo irregulares. Las densidades de aves en campos con y sin amortiguadores fueron mayores en la región de la Pradera Central de Hierbas Mixtas.

However, the effect of field buffers on bird species during the non-breeding season is less understood. We compared density, avian richness, and avian conservation value on row-crop fields containing buffers strategically designed for wildlife versus fields without buffers in 3 southeastern U.S. states during winter 2007 and 2008. Fields with buffers were enrolled in U.S. Department of Agriculture, Conservation Reserve Program practice Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds (CP33), which targets restoration of northern bobwhite ( Colinus virginianus) and other upland bird species. Overall species richness did not differ on fields with buffers versus fields without buffers in 2007, but was 29% greater on fields with buffers in 2008. Swamp sparrows ( Melospiza georgiana), song sparrows ( M. melodia), field sparrows ( Spizella pusilla), and red-bellied woodpeckers ( Melanerpes carolinus) had greater densities on fields with buffers compared with fields without buffers. Increasing field-buffer width did not result in greater bird densities. Our results suggest a small change in primary land use (≈7%) produced a disproportionate population response by some grassland-dependent and woodland bird species during winter. Because field buffers provide a direct source of winter food and cover resources, they may be a pragmatic means to provide critical non-breeding habitat with little alteration of existing agricultural systems. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.

The study covered five breeding seasons before land consolidation and another five afterwards. The project involved the disappearance of more than 50% of the hedgerows, and about 30% of the meadows and fallow lands were replaced by cultivation. Before land consolidation, breeding success was mainly affected by density-dependent factors, whereas afterwards density-independent factors such as weather or disease played an important role. The preferred feeding sites remained the same during the whole study period; fallow lands, rape fields and meadows were selected positively but cereal and potato fields were avoided. This characteristic became more apparent after land consolidation, because it involved a reduction in the feeding areas of the linnet. Numbers of eggs per clutch, hatchlings and fledglings were unaffected but fledging and breeding success of the first brood increased significantly during this period. Predation, which was the main cause of egg loss and nestling mortality, decreased significantly after land consolidation, through loss of hedges used as movement corridors by some specialist predators. The increase in the distance between breeding site and foraging area probably reduced the time spent by adults on their nests, leaving nestlings unprotected.","1995","2020-10-29 20:09:44","2021-10-19 13:13:50","","195-202","","","74","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three species assemblages in the fields were strongly related to crop type, with two others consisting of non-crop sites, one dominated by field margins, the other by ditch sites. Species activity and richness in fields were also strongly, and significantly, associated with crop type, with most in organic Brassica crops (cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli), less in organic leeks and least in conventional calabrese. Some species were significantly more active in weedier fields but others preferred more open ground. Considerably more species were recorded from first-year planted field margins, with fewest species active in unplanted margins. Activity was also relatively low in densely vegetated second-year margins. There appeared to be little relationship between species activity in the margins and that in the crop fields. Ground beetle species are important for the predation of cabbage root fly eggs in Brassica crops, especially in organic fields. In order to enhance and maximise appropriate ground beetle species activity and predation within vegetable fields, it is likely that management within both fields and margins would be required, as well as some method for increasing movement of predators from margins into fields.

Management, crop and boundary structure influences on invertebrate activity were assessed, as was the relationship between crop and boundary type. Classification of crop and boundary assemblages produced three and two groups, respectively, in both years. Organic arable crops had well-defined assemblages in both years; and, while grass and grass/clover fields were separated from conventional arable fields in 2005, there was mixing in 2006. One boundary group, in both years, was dominated by conventional arable fields with tall herbaceous boundary vegetation. The other group had more organic arable and grassy fields with shorter boundary vegetation. Redundancy analyses showed that a number of groups (Cantharidae, Coccinellidae, Syrphidae, Ichneumonidae, Braconidae, Proctotrupoidea, Lycosidae) were more active in organic arable fields with more Staphylinidae in conventional arable crops and no obvious trend with Carabidae, Hemiptera, Neuroptera and Linyphiidae. Activity of some groups, especially Coccinellidae, Syrphidae and parasitic wasps, was strongly related to weed cover. Staphylinidae were most active in tall herbaceous boundaries by conventional arable crops with more of a number of groups (Cantharidae, Coccinellidae, parasitic wasps) in short herbaceous boundaries by organic arable crops. Organic management produced most differences in aerially-dispersed invertebrates, and management had a profound effect on activity in field boundaries. Possible management prescriptions to increase invertebrate activity include changing sowing times, weed cover manipulation and field boundary and margin management.","2011","2020-10-29 20:09:45","2020-10-29 20:09:45","","135-144","","","101","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multivariate analyses indicated that a combination of crop type, management and boundary type influenced ground beetle species and group activity. Short vegetation boundaries with bare ground had similar activity, mainly of small species, to that in organic arable crops, contrasting with activity in conventional arable and more densely vegetated boundaries. Large, medium-sized, herbivorous and Collembola feeding species all had considerable activity in oilseed rape and activity was generally greatest in conventional arable crops but least in conventional grass. Disturbance and productivity estimations provided basic insights into ground beetle activity. Most small and medium-sized species were found in areas with low productivity but high and low disturbance, respectively. Large and Collembola feeding species were most active in highly productive areas with medium and low disturbance whilst most herbivorous species preferred medium values of both drivers. In crops, species richness was greatest in organic beans and conventional oilseed rape and lowest in conventional grass. There were more species in short vegetation boundaries than in more densely vegetated field edges. There may be potential for the use of productivity and disturbance estimations in the provision of ecosystem services, especially in assessing the conditions required to optimise ground beetle activity for pest control.

Understanding the environmental factors that structure biodiversity and food webs among communities is central to assess and mitigate the impact of landscape changes. Wildflower strips are ecological compensation areas established in farmland to increase pollination services and biological control of crop pests and to conserve insect diversity. They are arranged in networks in order to favour high species richness and abundance of the fauna. We describe results from experimental wildflower strips in a fragmented agricultural landscape, comparing the importance of landscape, of spatial arrangement and of vegetation on the diversity and abundance of trap-nesting bees, wasps and their enemies, and the structure of their food webs. The proportion of forest cover close to the wildflower strips and the landscape heterogeneity stood out as the most influential landscape elements, resulting in a more complex trap-nest community with higher abundance and richness of hosts, and with more links between species in the food webs and a higher diversity of interactions. We disentangled the underlying mechanisms for variation in these quantitative food web metrics. We conclude that in order to increase the diversity and abundance of pollinators and biological control agents and to favour a potentially stable community of cavity-nesting hymenoptera in wildflower strips, more investment is needed in the conservation and establishment of forest habitats within agro-ecosystems, as a reservoir of beneficial insect populations.","2013","2020-10-29 20:09:47","2020-11-06 22:46:27","","1203-1214","","","82","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hedgerows provide an important habitat for wildlife including invertebrates, representing a large proportion of semi-natural habitat patches in the modern agricultural landscapes of the UK and Europe. Around 40% of hedgerow length in England is managed under agri-environment scheme (AES) options, which specify less frequent cutting and advise cutting in winter. 2. Hedgerow management can alter habitat structure and quality, potentially influencing invertebrate community structure. We assessed the impacts of management treatments on moth communities and their parasitoids. Two treatments ('cutting frequency': once every 1, 2, or 3 years, and ` cutting time': autumn vs. winter) were applied to a long-running hedgerow experiment, mimicking AES prescriptions. Moth larvae were collected from the hedgerows, identified and reared to determine parasitism. Hedgerow structure and foliar quality were quantified and related to changes in moth abundance, diversity, species richness, and parasitism. 3. Hedgerow management did not significantly affect overall abundance of moth larvae, but did affect the abundance of certain feeding guilds and trophic interactions with parasitoids. Concealed moth larvae (mining, tentiform, and case bearing) were more abundant on hedgerows cut infrequently (every 2 or 3 years vs. annually). Parasitism rates were higher on hedgerows cut less often, when these were cut in autumn. There was a strong trend towards greater moth species richness and diversity on winter cut hedgerows. 4. Agri-environment scheme management can thus have complex effects on invertebrate communities. The abundance of some moths may be positively affected by AES hedgerow management and this can have knock-on effects on parasitoid abundance.","2014","2020-10-29 20:09:48","2021-10-19 13:14:26","","543-552","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While contour hedgerow systems are an effective method for soil water conservation, there are a few studies on its effect in the red soil hilly areas in Southeast China. With a fixed field experiment, we constructed a runoff plot at hilly area in Zhuji County, Zhejiang province, to evaluate the effect of the grass hedgerows in soil water conservation, and to determine the optimized hedgerow patterns. Hemerocallis citrine (HC) and Ophiopogon japonicas (OJ) were selected to build the hedgerows in patterns of one row and two rows. The REE method was used to trace the source of the sediment for a better understanding of the characteristic and mechanism of erosion with hedgerows control. Our results showed that (1) hedgerows reduced erosion and surface runoff by 31.99-67.22% and 15.44-45.11%, respectively; (2) hedgerows delayed the development of rills; (3) hedgerows reduced the soil nutrients loss; (4) hedgerows reshaped the soil physical properties, especially in increasing >0.25. mm water-stable aggregates. Taken together, our results suggest that two-row OJ is the optimized contour hedgerow pattern in the experiment condition, and downward sloping land should have the highest priority to take measures for soil water conservation. This research comprehensively studied the effects and mechanism of contour hedgerows in controlling soil and water loss in red soil hilly areas, Southeast China, so that the practice of soil and water conservation can be implemented more effectively in these areas. © 2015 International Research and Training Centre on Erosion and Sedimentation / the World Association for Sedimentation and Erosion Research.","2015","2020-10-29 20:09:49","2021-10-19 13:13:49","","107-116","","","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However few models have been built to predict the effects of field management on the flora. Our project addresses this need for a model capable of predicting the effect of cropping techniques and their timing on the flora of field margins. Primula vulgaris is a biodiversity indicator, characteristic of undisturbed flora and found in field margins and woodlands: its population has been declining for several years. We created a temporal matrix model of P. vulgaris populations on field margins, taking into account the effects of field, field margin and roadside management based on literature and expert knowledge. We then analysed its sensitivity to demographic parameters by comparing lambda (growth rate) sensitivity and elasticity. We compared the management parameter effect using the relative growth rate of the population after 6 years of simulation. Sensitivity analysis to biological parameters showed the importance of adult survival and seed production and germination. Results show that P. vulgaris is particularly sensitive to broad-spectrum herbicides and that other management techniques like early mowing, scything and scrub-killer (diluted broad-spectrum herbicide or specific herbicide) are less aggressive. Our simulations show that management of cash crops in Brittany is too aggressive for P. vulgar-is populations and that 4-5 years of grassland in the adjacent field are necessary to maintain populations.

This study was developed to evaluate the potential of selected management practices (MP's) for reducing total solids, nutrients and pesticides from discharge water in order to improve the surface water quality in southwest Louisiana [USA]. Five rice plots located on the Rice Research Station in Crowley, LA represented the different MP's to be evaluated. The five water seeding MP's were: a.1-no till; a.2-water cultivation with 30-day settling; a.3-dry cultivation with clear water planting; a.4-mudding-in with vegetated filter; and b-mudding-in (control). Quality of discharged water from rice fields in the Mermentau River Basin was clearly affected by the different MP's. From the first year of data, all the MPa's were better than the mudding-in (MPb). The concentrations of the total solids (kg/ha) in the discharged water (initial+final drain) for the different MP's were in the order: MPb(4860)>MPa.3(3906)>MPa.4(3412)>MPa.2(3068)>MPa.1(1807). The MPa.3, MPa.4 and MPb had no detectable amounts of pesticides being released. The 30-day holding period (MPa.2), clear water planting (MPa.3) and the mudding-in with vegetated filter (MPa.4) were similar as far as TDS, TSS and TS with the no-till (MPa.1) being the least. The 30-day holding period (MPa.2) and the no-till (MPa.1) had less nutrients, but more pesticides released. Depending on the priority of the stream problems, different MP's may be more advantageous than others. All of the selected MP's were better than the control (MPb), and therefore, should help to improve water quality.","1992","2020-10-29 20:09:50","2021-10-19 13:13:48","","1305-1321","","","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The abundance and species richness of butterflies on expanded-width uncropped arable field edges, which were subject to 10 contrasting, experimental management regimes, were measured using transects in 1989, 1990 and 1991. The effects of the management regimes on a number of botanical variables, likely to be of importance to butterflies, were measured. 2. On the experimental field edges, butterfly abundance and species richness fluctuated between years and peaked at different times each year. 3. Butterfly abundance and species richness differed between experimental treatments. Plots which were either cut in the spring and autumn, or not cut at all, attracted more individuals and species of butterfly than did plots cut in the summer. Sowing with a grass and wild flower seed mixture increased butterfly abundance. Butterfly abundance declined on swards sprayed once annually with herbicide. 4. Mowing, sowing and spraying had significant effects on mean flower abundance, on the annual and perennial components flowering in the sward, and on the abundance of commonly used nectar sources and larval host-plants. 5.

A study, investigating effects on biodiversity of Ireland's Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) is described. Field margin flora and Carabidae (ground beetle) fauna were surveyed on 60 paired agreement and non-agreement farms. Greater variation was observed amongst surveyed non-agreement farms: the most species-rich and species-poor farms were all non-agreement. On surveyed grassland farms, average plant species richness was significantly higher on non-agreement than on agreement farms. Otherwise, few differences between average species richness and abundance on agreement and non-agreement farms were revealed. In ordination analysis of the flora and carabidae data factors largely independent of recent management, such as hedge age and gappiness, were most important in explaining observed variation. The study concluded that the scheme has not significantly benefited the groups surveyed, and suggests that the generic measures in such horizontal schemes may be better suited to addressing landscape-level issues such as water pollution, with biodiversity objectives for high nature value areas being more effectively achieved by targeted zonal schemes. Baseline data and long-term monitoring of measurable objectives are essential for effective evaluation, both to better tailor these innovative schemes to their aims, and to clearly demonstrate their benefits.

While many crops benefit from insect pollination, soft fruit crops, including strawberries are highly dependent on this ecosystem service to produce viable fruit. However, as a result of intensive farming practices and declining pollinator populations, farmers are increasingly turning to commercially reared bees to ensure that crops are adequately pollinated throughout the season. Wildflower strips are a commonly used measure aimed at the conservation of wild pollinators. It has been suggested that commercial crops may also benefit from the presence of noncrop flowers; however, the efficacy and economic benefits of sowing flower strips for crops remain relatively unstudied. In a study system that utilizes both wild and commercial pollinators, we test whether wildflower strips increase the number of visits to adjacent commercial strawberry crops by pollinating insects. We quantified this by experimentally sowing wildflower strips approximately 20 meters away from the crop and recording the number of pollinator visits to crops with, and without, flower strips. Between June and August 2013, we walked 292 crop transects at six farms in Scotland, recording a total of 2826 pollinators. On average, the frequency of pollinator visits was 25% higher for crops with adjacent flower strips compared to those without, with a combination of wild and commercial bumblebees (Bombus spp.) accounting for 67% of all pollinators observed. This effect was independent of other confounding effects, such as the number of flowers on the crop, date, and temperature. Synthesis and applications. This study provides evidence that soft fruit farmers can increase the number of pollinators that visit their crops by sowing inexpensive flower seed mixes nearby. By investing in this management option, farmers have the potential to increase and sustain pollinator populations over time.","2015","2020-10-29 20:09:52","2021-10-19 13:13:57","","3523-3530","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aims: To investigate the role of habitat and structural hedgerow components on breeding densities of Robins and to provide baseline territory density estimates for the Robin in a range of habitats in south-west Ireland. Methods: Robin territory densities were estimated at 39 sites of five major habitat types in southwest Ireland. A modified CBC-type technique was used to census Robins and additional habitat data were collected at each site. One-way ANOVA with post hoc testing was used to investigate the population densities between the different habitat groupings, and a principal component analysis of habitat data was used to generate independent variables for a stepwise regression where territory density per hectare and territory density per kilometre were, in turn, the dependent variables. Results: Population densities varied significantly between habitat types. The highest Robin territory densities were encountered in semi-improved grassland sites and the lowest values in suburban gardens. The mean territory density per hectare in all farmland habitats surveyed was notably higher than published estimates for British farmland and woodland. The quantity of hedgerow available appeared to be an important factor in determining Robin abundance on farmland. There was also a relationship between various hedgerow structural components and Robin territory density. Conclusion: Our analysis indicated that high bushy hedgerows with narrow banks and low basal vegetation positively influenced the number of Robin territories per hectare. We also conclude that if basal vegetation becomes overgrown at some critical point it impedes detection of prey by Robins, even when there are many available foraging perches. © 2006 British Trust for Ornithology.","2006","2020-10-29 20:09:52","2020-10-29 20:09:52","","97-104","","","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have focused on the extent of a buffer required to prevent nutrient (e.g. phosphorus) enrichment of surface waters through runoff. If forested corridors are to be effective nutrient buffers, it is important to understand the patterns of nutrient deposition in buffer soils and the long-term potential for nutrients leaching via shallow groundwater. The first section of this research focuses on patterns of phosphorus and secondary nutrient enrichment and saturation within forested buffers. By testing soil cores taken across the widths of forested riparian corridors bordering active agricultural fields, I found significant declines in phosphorus concentration and saturation levels after 10m. Phosphorus saturation levels were low to moderate, and none of the buffers I sampled showed a high risk of phosphorus leaching into shallow groundwater. I also found significant declines in base saturation and cation exchange capacity, as well as in the concentrations of calcium, manganese, and potassium as distance from the edge of the buffer increased. These changes suggest that the declines in phosphorus and phosphorus saturation may be due in part to changes in nutrient cycling within the buffer and not entirely due to differential rates of phosphorus deposition. Regardless of the cause of the declining phosphorus concentrations, my data suggest that a forested buffer of 10 m is sufficient under most conditions for the protection of surface waters from phosphorus runoff, though wider buffers may be advisable if active management of the buffer is anticipated. Whether resulting from an effort to protect surface waters or as a natural consequence of human land use patterns, fragmented forested riparian corridors may be the only forest habitat available. As such, they are an opportunity to promote biodiversity within managed ecosystems, and a prime target for efforts to promote biotic integrity. Invasion by non-native plants is one threat to biotic integrity and native biodiversity that is of particular concern in fragmented landscapes. The second section of this research examines the role of corridor width in the exclusion of non-native invasive plants. Some invasive plants, being edge specialists or generalists, have been shown to be less competitive in forest interior habitats. By examining the prevalence of several non-native plants across the forested corridors of varying widths, I determined the extent to which increasing buffer width may help prevent invasive plant domination within corridors and especially along stream banks. While Japanese honeysuckle and multi-flora rose did not significantly decline across corridor widths, Oriental bittersweet and garlic mustard showed strong declines after 20 m. These findings suggest that modest increases in riparian corridor width can have a positive impact on the exclusion of some exotic species from forest interiors and may help to improve the biotic integrity of these habitats.","2015","2020-10-29 20:09:53","2020-10-29 20:09:53","","","61","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9781321610895","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, they have a great potential to reduce runoff volume and peak discharge rate, especially if they are located in relatively small watersheds typical for many small patterned landscapes in Europe. Due to the flow characteristics in a GWW, an area of shallow sheet flow on the side-slopes and another of concentrated flow along the thalweg can be identified. The runoff control on the side-slopes is comparable to that of vegetative filter strips, which was intensively investigated in many studies. Our objectives were to use experimental field data, modeling and a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the parameters (morphology, soil, vegetation, water input) dominating the concentrated runoff along the thalweg of a GWW, and thus to optimize GWW layout. The experimental data were derived by pumping concentrated inflow to the upstream end of two GWWs (290 and 370m long). The used model is simulating infiltration according to the Philip''s [Adv. Hydrosci. 5 (1969) 215] equation and routing the runoff with a kinematic wave approximation. The experiment showed a great difference in runoff control between the two tested GWWs, e.g. one reduced runoff volume by 90% the other by 49%. The model agreed well with the experimental data. From the sensitivity analysis of the model parameters, it appeared that the main reason for the difference in runoff characteristics was the flat-bottomed compared to more or less v-shaped cross-section of the thalweg. Differences in hydraulic roughness between the tested GWWs were small, but in general hydraulic roughness is a sensitive parameter in runoff control of a GWW, because in case of grass submergence or high runoff velocities grass is bent to the ground, and hence the hydraulic roughness drops drastically. Soil conditions are only prominent if higher saturated conductivities were assumed than measured at the test site. For colluvial soils typically found where GWWs are established similar efficiencies in runoff control can be expected for similar inflow hydrographs. In general, a high potential of GWWs to reduce runoff volume and peak discharge could be verified within the examined scope of site conditions.

Runoff and sediment delivery were measured between 1994 and 2001 in two paired subwatersheds, both optimised to reduce runoff and sediment delivery by an intensive soil conservation system within the fields.

During the observation period it reduced runoff and sediment delivery by 87 and 93%, respectively. 70% of total outflow and 68% of total sediment output occurred between February and April, mainly controlled by watershed hydrology. Seasonal changes in GWW properties, namely soil water content and hydraulic roughness, had a minor effect. It was most notably in May and June, when available field capacity averaged 59% while inflow was dominated by single heavy rain events (15% of total inflow).

It is unknown how such a GWW affects the loading of surface runoff with dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP). The effect on DRP was tested in a landscape-scale study where DRP concentrations and loads in surface runoff were measured in two watersheds in which GWWs were newly installed and increased in effectiveness over time. Both watersheds were compared with paired watersheds without GWW installation; all watersheds were continuously monitored over 5 yr (1993-1997). Additionally, DRP concentrations were measured in open field and throughfall precipitation under growing grass and crops in field experiments, and DRP concentrations in surface runoff from straw covered surfaces were determined with laboratory rainfall simulation experiments. Dissolved reactive P in throughfall for the different cover types was highly variable, and the highest concentrations (up to 2.8 mg L(-1)) occurred especially during flowering of the respective crop and after frost events. Dissolved reactive P concentrations in runoff from straw-covered surfaces were slightly higher compared with those from bare soil. On average, there was a small difference in DRP concentrations between throughfall under growing crops and grass and in runoff from bare or straw covered soil surfaces. Hence, the introduction of a relatively small grassed area has little effect on the DRP concentration in surface runoff from the total watershed. This finding was supported by the watershed data, where watersheds with and without GWW showed similar DRP concentrations. No change in DRP concentrations occurred over the 5-yr period. Such GWWs will thus reduce the DRP load analogously to the reduction in total surface runoff.","2009","2020-10-29 20:09:57","2021-10-19 13:13:52","","548-559","","","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the influence of riparian buffers on biotic assemblages in streams is poorly understood, particularly in the Midwestern United States. In this study, we evaluated the effects of riparian buffers on instream habitat, fish assemblage structure, and population characteristics (i. e., the growth of two small-bodied species) in three streams in central Iowa. The streams were surveyed at two spatial scales; specifically, 41 reaches were sampled and 247 macrohabitat types (i. e., pool, riffle, and run) were subsampled in the summer of 2007. Fish assemblage structure data were summarized into separate data sets by the relative abundance of individual species (i. e., fish per minute of electrofishing) and guilds (e. g., trophic and spawning). Multivariate analysis of variance was used to evaluate the differences in instream habitat and fish assemblage structure between areas with and without riparian buffers. The results indicated little to no relationship between the presence of buffers and fish assemblage structure and instream habitat characteristics. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) was used to evaluate the patterns of fish assemblage structure for the reaches and macrohabitat types. The NMS further illustrated the similarity in fish assemblages between buffered and unbuffered reaches. However, the growth of central stonerollers Campostoma anomalum was greatest in unbuffered reaches, while that of creek chub Semotilus atromaculatus was greatest in buffered reaches. Differences in food availability associated with riparian buffers (e. g., increased algal production and decreased terrestrial invertebrate contributions in unbuffered reaches) probably resulted in growth disparities. The results of this study suggest that while riparian buffers have minimal local effects on instream habitat and fish assemblage structure in Iowa streams, they influence instream features (e. g., food availability) that affect fish population dynamics.","2010","2020-10-29 20:09:58","2020-10-29 20:09:58","","185-200","","","139","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study monitored (December 2009-May 2011) N2O fluxes at two agricultural riparian buffers in the White River watershed in Indiana to assess the impact of land use and hydrogeomorphologic (HGM) attributes on emission. The study sites included a riparian forest in a glacial outwash/alluvium setting (White River [WR]) and a grassed riparian buffer in tile-drained till plains (Leary Weber Ditch [LWD]). Adjacent corn (Zea mays L.) fields were monitored for land use assessment. Analysis of variance identified season, land use (riparian buffer vs. crop field), and site geomorphology as major drivers of N2O fluxes. Strong relationships between N mineralization and N2O fluxes were found at both sites, but relationships with other nutrient cycling indicators (C/N ratio, dissolved organic C, microbial biomass C) were detected only at LWD. Nitrous oxide emission showed strong seasonal variability; the largest N2O peaks occurred in late spring/early summer as a result of flooding at the WR riparian buffer (up to 27.8 mg N2O-N m(-2) d(-1)) and N fertilizer application to crop fields. Annual N2O emission (kg N2O-N ha(-1)) was higher in the crop fields (WR: 7.82; LWD: 6.37) than in the riparian areas. A significant difference (P < 0.02) in annual N2O emission between the riparian buffers was detected (4.32 vs. 1.03 kg N2O-N ha(-1) at WR and LWD, respectively), and this difference was attributed to site geomorphology and flooding (WR is flood prone; no flooding occurred at tile-drained LWD). The study results demonstrate the significance of landscape geomorphology and land-stream connection (i.e., flood potential) as drivers of N2O emission in riparian buffers and therefore argue that an HGM-based approach should be especially suitable for determination of regional N2O budget in riparian ecosystems.","2014","2020-10-29 20:09:58","2021-10-19 13:14:30","","338-348","","","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This also applies to the experimental releases of GM plants in field trials. Therefore, biosafety measures such as isolation distances and surveying of PMGF are required by the regulatory authorities in Switzerland. For two and three years, respectively, we monitored crop-to-crop PMGF from GM wheat field trials in two locations in Switzerland. The pollen donors were two GM spring wheat lines with enhanced fungal resistance and a herbicide tolerance as a selection marker. Seeds from the experimental plots were sampled to test the detection method for outcrosses. Two outcrosses were found adjacent to a transgenic plot within the experimental area. For the survey of PMGF, pollen receptor plots of the conventional wheat variety Frisal used for transformation were planted in the border crop and around the experimental field up to a distance of 200 m. Although the environmental conditions were favorable and the donor and receptor plots flowered at the same time, only three outcrosses were found in approximately 185,000 tested seedlings from seeds collected outside the experimental area. All three hybrids were found in the border crop surrounding the experimental area, but none outside the field. We conclude that a pollen barrier (border crop) and an additional isolation distance of 5 m is a sufficient measure to reduce PMGF from a GM wheat field trial to cleistogamous varieties in commercial fields below a level that can be detected.","2012","2020-10-29 20:10:00","2020-10-29 20:10:00","","115-122","","2","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In these environments, the effects of landscape structures on soil pedogenesis and properties are identified, yet the time scale on which the target processes are occurring remains unknown. The aim of this paper is to constrain the space and time changes in hedge structure, within a historical hedged landscape, in order to better quantify the dynamics of A-horizons geometry. To achieve this goal, we implemented various relative methods (soil geometry analysis, historical document analysis) and absolute methods ((14)C, (137)CS). Results highlight the complexity of soil spatial organization within the landscape: A-horizon geometry is clearly influenced by landscape structures, whereas deeper horizons appear not to be influenced by these structures. The explanatory factors of this current organization are not only the present topography and hedgerow network pattern, but also the position of former hedgerows. Organo-mineral horizon changes clearly post-date the establishment of the hedgerow network landscape, which has controlled topsoil horizon geometry. Since 1833, the decrease in hedgerow network density has changed the spatial distribution of soil redistributions through diffusive transport (including tillage translocation) and water erosion processes; locally, it has increased soil erosion processes with respect to the increase in uphill drainage surface areas without changing general soil organization at the landscape scale acquired over the longer term.

Hedgerows: an international perspective on their origin, function and management. Journal of Environmental Management 60 (1), 7–22.]. These manmade landscapes are typically comprised of fields separated by boundaries, often marked by perennial vegetation (hedges or shelterbelts), yet little is known about the effect of these field margins on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and their dynamics, which offer large carbon sequestration potential [Walter, C., Mérot, P., Layer, B., Dutin, G., 2003. The effect of hedgerows on soil organic carbon storage in hillslopes. Soil Use and Management 19, 201–207.; Falloon, P., Powlson, D., Smith, P., 2004. Managing field margins for biodiversity and carbon sequestration: a Great Britain case study. Soil Use and Management 20, 240–247.]. In hedged landscapes, hedges induce a modification to the soil A-horizon geometry at the slope scale, as attributed to an anti-erosive effect, along with a local modification of the associated SOC stocks. Most studies undertaken within this context have been performed in two dimensions and under favourable conditions for soil accumulation with the hedges lying perpendicular to the steepest slope direction. Consequently, an extrapolation of these findings to the entire landscape can lead to overestimating SOC stocks at the landscape scale. The aims of this paper were to: quantify SOC stocks, describe their spatial variability in three dimensions, and identify the main determinants behind this variability within an agricultural hedgerow network landscape. To achieve these aims, we conducted a detailed field survey that took into account all three dimensions of the soil cover and anthropogenic structures. We then analysed the spatial distribution of SOC contents and stocks with respect to pedological and landscape parameters. Results show that SOC stocks may be locally significant in the vicinity of hedges with a median stock value of 16.6 kg C m−2, in comparison with stock at the landscape scale (13.3 kg C m−2). This study has highlighted the need to incorporate the three dimensions of soil cover at the landscape scale in order to characterise SOC storage. This step will prevent the generalisation of local stocks at a landscape scale given the high variability of SOC stocks (1st quartile=10.5 kg C m−2; 3rd quartile=18.5 kg C m−2) induced by hedge structures.

For all variables measured, significant Site effects were detected. Survival, biomass yield and volume yield were highest at the Bromptonville site. After 6 years of growth, total aboveground biomass production (stems+branches+leaves) reached 112.8tDM/ha and total leafless biomass production (stems+branches) reached 101.1tDM/ha at this site, while stem wood volume attained 237.5m3/ha. Yields as low as 14.2tDM/ha for total biomass and 24.8m3/ha for total stem volume were also observed at the Magog site. Highest yields were obtained on the most fertile sites, particularly in terms of NO3 supply rate. Mean stem volume per tree was highly correlated with NO3 supply rate in soils (R 2 =0.58, p <0.001). Clone effects were also detected for most of the variables measured. Total aboveground biomass and total stem volume production were high for clone 3729 (Populus nigra × P. maximowiczii) (73.1tDM/ha and 134.2m3/ha), although not statistically different from clone 915311 (P. maximowiczii × P. balsamifera). However, mean whole-tree biomass (including leaves) was significantly higher for clone 3729 (38.8kgDM/tree). Multifunctional agroforestry systems such as hybrid poplar riparian buffer strips are among the most sustainable ways to produce a high amount of biomass and wood in a short time period, while contributing to alleviate environmental problems such as agricultural non-point source pollution.

For all land uses most of the root biomass was within the 0-20 cm depth range. Total coarse root biomass, to a 60 cm depth, ranged from 8.8-73.7 t/ha in woodlots, 0.61.3 t/ha in herbaceous buffers, and 9.2-27.3 t/ha in poplars. Total fine root biomass ranged from 2.68-8.64 t/ha in woodlots, 2.60-3.29 t/ha in herbaceous buffers, and 1.86-2.62 t/ha in poplars. Total root biomass was similar or higher in poplar buffers compared to a 27 year-old grey birch forest. This indicates that poplar buffers accelerated riparian soil colonisation by roots compared to natural secondary succession. Generally, fine root biomass in the surface soil (0-20 cm) was lower in poplar than in herbaceous buffers; the reverse was observed at greater depth. Highest coarse root biomass in the 40-60 cm depth range was observed in a poplar buffer, highlighting the deep rooted nature of poplars. On average, total soil C stocks (0-60 cm) were greater in woodlots than in riparian buffers. On most sites, soil C stocks tended to be lower in poplar buffers compared to adjacent herbaceous buffers, especially in surface soil, probably because of lower fine root biomass in poplar buffers. Across all sites and land uses, highest soil C stocks at the different soil depths were found in the soil layers of woodlots that also had the greatest fine root biomass. Strong positive linear relationships between fine root biomass and soil C stocks in the 0-20 cm depth range (R-2 = 0.79, p < 0.001), and in the whole soil profile (0-60 cm) (R-2 = 0.65, p < 0.01), highlight the central role of fine root biomass in maintaining or increasing soil C stocks.","2013","2020-10-29 20:10:02","2021-10-19 13:14:37","","","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The afforestation of these riparian zones has the potential to increase carbon (C) storage in agricultural landscapes by creating a new biomass sink for atmospheric CO2. Occurring at the same time, the storage of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in plant biomass, is an important water quality function that may greatly vary with types of riparian vegetation. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare C, N and P storage in aboveground, belowground and detrital biomass for three types of riparian vegetation cover (9-year-old hybrid poplar buffers, herbaceous buffers and natural woodlots) across four agricultural sites and (2) to determine potential vegetation cover effects on soil nutrient supply rate in the riparian zone. Site level comparisons suggest that 9-year-old poplar buffers have stored 9-31 times more biomass C, 4-10 times more biomass N, and 3-7 times more biomass P than adjacent non managed herbaceous buffers, with the largest differences observed on the more fertile sites. The conversion of these herbaceous buffers topoplar buffers could respectively increase C, N and P storage in biomass by 3.2-11.9 t/ha/yr, 32-124 kg/ha/yr and 3.2-15.6 kg/ha/yr, over 9 years. Soil NO3 and P supply rates during the summer were respectively 57% and 66% lower in poplar buffers than in adjacent herbaceous buffers, potentially reflecting differences in nutrient storage and cycling between the two buffer types. Biomass C ranged 49 -160 t/ha in woodlots, 33-110 t/ha in poplar buffers and 3-4 t/ha in herbaceous buffers. Similar biomass C stocks were found in the most productive poplar buffer and three of the four woodlots studied. Given their large and varied biomass C stocks, conservation of older riparian woodlots is equally important for C balance management in farmland. In addition, the establishment of poplar buffers, in replacement of non managed herbaceous buffers, could rapidly increase biomass C, N and P storage along farm streams, which would be beneficial for water quality protection and global change mitigation.

Hedges represent a new and undisturbed habitat for those polyphagous predators and may provide increased prey availability. Carabids were sampled with pitfall traps in a hedge and an adjacent cultivated field during the whole activity period of these insects to assess the effect of distance from the hedge on species diversity. Fenced pitfall traps were also used to estimate absolute population densities. Several diversity indices were calculated at various sampling levels (total area, distance treatment, trap). Kendall's coefficient of rank correlation between communities at adjacent distances' showed that the greatest changes in species relative abundances occurred close to the hedge. Indices of species richness, dominance concentration, equitability and Fisher's α all indicated a significant decrease in species diversity with increasing distance from the hedge. These trends are explained by two complementary factors. First, the number of species decreased significantly with distance from the centre of the hedge. Second, the various species had different spatial patterns of total capture and absolute density. Four groups of species can thus be distinguished: species restricted to the hedge, species preferring the hedge, species preferring the crop, and species unaffected by the hedge. The respective roles of small-scale abiotic changes in habitat structure and differences in prey availability are discussed.","1999","2020-10-29 20:10:03","2021-10-19 13:13:52","","87-97","","","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A capture-recapture experiment was conducted to examine the effects of satiation state on the activity and foraging efficiency of the carabid beetle Pterostichus melanarius Ill., in four different habitats (a hedge, a transition zone between the hedge and the adjacent wheat crop, the margin of the wheat crop, and the centre of the wheat crop) in an agricultural ecosystem in France. 2. Prey biomass and density decreased from the centre of the hedge to the crop margin and to the centre of the crop, where prey density was low but prey biomass was moderate. Starved and satiated beetles were released in circular enclosures and recaptured using pitfall traps for 6 days. 3. Immediately after release, starved P. melanarius were significantly more active than satiated beetles, but this difference disappeared after the first day. At each recapture date, starved individuals had gained weight whereas satiated individuals had lost weight. The analysis of activity and weight variation at the end of the first day indicated that the centre of the crop seemed to be the most favourable habitat for starved individuals to find food rapidly, whereas the behaviour of satiated individuals was identical in all habitats. 4. This experiment shows that habitat use of P. melanarius is flexible. The results are discussed in the context of the classical view of foraging behaviour in carabid beetles. The activity and foraging efficiency in P. melanarius in different habitats can be explained as the result of the interaction between individual satiation state, prey availability in the habitat, and particular preferences of the species.","2001","2020-10-29 20:10:04","2020-10-29 20:10:04","","235-244","","","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a field-scale study to determine if habitat manipulations along the field edges of an organic crop rotation increase the activity-density of beneficial ground-dwelling invertebrates. Pitfall traps were used to collect micro and macro ground-dwelling organisms in nine organic crop fields (three each of maize, soybeans, and hay; 2.5-4.0 ha each) surrounded by four experimental habitat manipulations (planted native grass and prairie flowers, planted prairie flowers only, fallow vegetation, or mowed vegetation) during 2009 and 2010 in eastern North Carolina. Beneficial macro and micro invertebrates collected in these pitfall traps consisted primarily of Carabidae, Araneae, Collembola, and mite species. Results show that habitat manipulations had little effect on the activity-density of the dominant epigaeic invertebrates in our study system.

We used predator exclusion cages to determine the amount of weed seed removal caused by invertebrates and vertebrates. Three common agricultural weed species, redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), broadleaf signalgrass (Urochloa platyphylla), and sicklepod (Senna obtusifolia), were adhered to individual cards and placed inside the exclosure cages once a month for two weeks. Activity-density of invertebrate weed seed predators was measured with pitfall traps. Results show that field border type had no effect on seed removal rates, but that crop type heavily influenced both weed seed predation and invertebrate seed predator activity-density. Weed seed predation was highest in the dense, perennial hay fields and lowest in the more open harvested maize fields. Activity-densities for field crickets (Gryllus sp.) and the ground beetle Harpalus pennsylvanicus were also high in the hay fields and low in the maize fields, while the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) seemed to prefer the open maize fields. These results show that increasing vegetative diversity in field borders is not always an effective method for conserving weed seed predators, but that higher quality habitat inside the crop field can be achieved by increasing ground cover.

Investigations began when winter wheat seedlings emerged and lasted for five weeks. Slug damage was never severe in any of the fields studied. In most fields, slug damage was higher close to the wildflower strips than at greater distances from the strips. The declining slug damage with increasing distances from the wildflowers strips was related to the distribution pattern of juvenile Arion lusitanicus, suggesting that this species was responsible for the higher damage near the strips.

Slug damage to rape plants 1 m from the grass strips was significantly higher than at greater distances from the strips. Deroceras reticulatum was the most abundant slug species recorded in both grass strips and adjacent rape fields. Arion lusitanicus and Arion fasciatus were much less abundant than D. reticulatum. In one field, D. reticulatum declined steadily with increasing distance from the grass strips and therefore appeared to have caused the majority of severe damage to rape plants close to the strips. This finding was surprising because until now severe slug damage in oilseed rape beside semi-natural habitats has been observed only where A. lusitanicus was abundant.

Copro- and phytophagous hoverflies were observed in very low numbers acid they were almost entirely confined to the weed strips and the field boundary. The weed strips contained a high density of flowering plants and therefore proved to be very attractive feeding places for all hoverflies.

Carabids were caught in sixteen 1-4-year-old wildflower areas, identified and counted, their nutritional condition was calculated and calculations were related to habitat parameters (i.e. wildflower area age, vegetation cover, soil water content, habitat size, surrounding landscape composition) and sex. Whereas the number of Anisodactylus binotatus caught responded positively to succession in wildflower areas, A. mulleri numbers tended to decrease and the other three species were unaffected. In a stepwise multiple regression species affiliation, sex and age of wildflower area explained together 98.5% of the variance in the pooled nutritional condition of Anchomenus dorsalis, Anisodactylus binotatus, A. mulleri and P. vernalis. Age of wildflower area alone explained 61.7% of the variance and age increased the nutritional condition of carabids. Correspondingly, nutritional condition of Poecilus cupreus was positively correlated with the age of wildflower area. Overall, the nutritional condition of the carabid assemblage studied increased from the first to the second year and then remained stable. To keep the proportion of I year-old wildflower areas low, wildflower areas should therefore be maintained for several years to improve the life conditions of carabid beetles and to enhance their beneficial effects in agroecosystems.

A similar but less distinct pattern was observed for the abundance and species richness of carabid beetles. The influence of habitat parameters (vegetation cover, fine sand content, organic matter, pH, soil pore volume, surrounding landscape structure, habitat area) on the staphylinid and carabid assemblages based on the number of individuals per species and site was analysed using canonical correspondence analysis. Vegetation cover was the most significant parameter significantly characterizing both staphylinid and carabid assemblages. The amount of vegetation cover explained 15.7% of the variance, fine sand content accounted for 13.3% and surrounding landscape structure for 10.9% of the variance in the staphylinid assemblage.

Appropriate agroecosystems management may favour this type of indirect interaction. In that context, our aim was to test the effect of rose bush [ Rosa rugosa (Thunb.)] strips on the building up of aphid populations and of their natural enemies in adjacent cereal habitats. Several aphid species are currently found on Rosa sp. including Metopolophium dirhodum (Walker) for which it is a primary host. Aphid predators and parasitoids may build their populations on the aphid population present on Rosa sp. and later on migrate to wheat field during the cereal aphid infestation. Moreover, the flowers of the rose bushes may provide a source of nectar and pollen to these natural enemies. Our experiment was conducted in three rose margin wheat plots with a strip of rose bushes of R. rugosa and three control plots. Plots were compared during 2 years (2003 and 2004). Aphid, parasitoid and predator densities were recorded from May to the harvest of wheat on rose bushes and in wheat. In 2003, the aphid densities were moderate but in 2004, the population of aphid was very high. Even if predator and parasitoids arrived earlier in rose margin field than in control ones, the presence of rose bushes did not influence the aphid population within the field. Metopolophium dirhodum did not seem to migrate from the rose bushes to wheat. The level of parasitism was weak in rose bushes and the natural enemy population was not different in rose margin wheat and in control plots. The causes of the lack of efficiency of this type of management are discussed as well as the high aphid population in wheat in 2004.

Manipulation of field margins for biodiversity enhancement in arable systems has been extensively investigated. However, there is a paucity of corresponding long-term research within intensively managed grasslands. We investigated a combination of establishment and management methods to enhance botanical diversity of newly established field margins in intensively managed grasslands. Three methods of field margin establishment were investigated including fencing, natural regeneration by rotavation, or seeding with a wildflower mixture. Subsequent sward management by either grazing or mowing was tested at three margin widths. Success of establishment was addressed in terms of persistence of species richness, plant community composition and incidence of noxious weeds. Seeding with a wildflower mixture was the most successful establishment method to enhance plant species richness and this effect persisted throughout the 7 years of the experiment ( = 16·4 ± 0·43 SE plant species richness per 1 × 3 m quadrat). Mown ( = 6·01 ± 0·30 SE) and rotavated ( = 9·7 ± 0·34 SE) treatments contained significantly fewer plant species; grazed controls contained 9·83 ± 0·24 species. Grazing led to a significant, but modest increase in species richness in fenced and rotavated plots compared to the mowing treatment, but had no effect in seeded plots. Grazing also led to an increased frequency and cover of competitive grasses in the seeded treatment. Although margin width was not found to significantly influence species richness, there was increased herb cover and reduced abundance of noxious weeds in the wider seeded margins. Synthesis and applications. The choice of establishment method and subsequent management of grassland field margins significantly affected their conservation value. The botanical diversity of margins within intensively managed pasture can be enhanced by sowing wildflower seed mixtures. This diversity can be maintained over time through appropriate management, i.e. either the reduction of high grazing pressure by seasonal fencing, or annual mowing. Management approaches that involve minimal change are currently adopted in many agri-environment schemes (such as fencing and/or the cessation of nutrient inputs) but did not produce swards of conservation value in this study.

The sampling and trapping covering all seasonal aspects were performed in an agricultural landscape near Venice (Italy). Higher numbers of flying adults were trapped in the field margin and the field; values in the hedgerow and the grass strip were lower. In contrast, the lowest values of larval abundance were found in the field, while values in the extended field margin, the grass strip and the hedgerow were higher. Comparison of extensively used (uncultivated) part of the field margin with intensively used part of the field margin and centre of the field indicated that the increase in larval abundance in the uncultivated margin is caused by reduced cultivation and not by marginal position. According to the spatial distributions of adults and larvae, several groups can be distinguished. The first Dipteran group develops in various habitats and prefers the field as adults, e.g. for hunting (Dolichopodidae). The second group develops in the field (particularly, some pest Chloropidae and Agromyzidae) and occurs there as adults too.

Agri-environment schemes (AES) have been introduced in many countries as an attempt to counteract the negative effects of intensive agriculture by providing financial incentives for farmers to adopt environmentally-sensitive agricultural practices. We surveyed 18 pairs of AES and conventionally-managed farms in central Scotland (United Kingdom) to evaluate the effects of specific AES management prescriptions (field margins, hedgerows, species-rich grasslands and water margins) on farmland moths. We also measured the influence of the surrounding landscape on moth populations at three spatial scales (250 m, 500 m and 1 km radii from each trapping site) to assess at which scale management was most important for the conservation of farmland moths. In general, percentage cover of rough grassland and scrub within 250 m of the trapping site was the most important landscape predictor for both micro- and macromoth abundance and macromoth species richness, although negative effects of urbanization were found at wider scales (within 1 km), particularly for macromoth species richness. The abundance and species richness of micromoths was significantly higher within field margins and species-rich grasslands under AES management in comparison to their conventional counterparts, whereas AES water margins increased micromoth abundance, but not species richness. AES species-rich grasslands and water margins were associated with an increased macromoth abundance and species richness, and macromoths considered 'widespread but rapidly declining' also gained some benefits from these two AES prescriptions. In contrast, hedgerows under AES management enhanced neither micromoth nor macromoth populations. Synthesis and applications. Our findings indicate that increasing the percentage cover of semi-natural environment at a local scale (e.g. within 250 m) benefits both micro- and macromoth populations, and that the implementation of simple AES management prescriptions applied to relatively small areas can increase the species richness and abundance of moth populations in agricultural environments.

Breeding bird communities in hedgerows and woodland in lowland England and Wales were compared in terms of species richness and similarity of species composition. The preference of individual species for hedgerows and woodland was also assessed. The data were drawn from 33 farmland and 35 woodland Common Birds Census plots for 3 years: 1990, 1993 and 1996. Woodland plots were significantly richer in species than farmland plots. Species number on farmland plots increased linearly with the cover of farm woodland and non-linearly with density of total hedgerow. Species number increased with density of non-roadside hedgerows, but not with density of roadside hedgerows. Although the farmland and woodland plots supported distinctive bird communities, there was considerable overlap between them in species composition. The similarity between the species composition on individual farms and that theoretically possible for woodland increased significantly with the cover of farm woodland, hedgerow density and the total amount of woody habitat present within the farmland plot. Canonical correspondence analysis and preference indices indicated that seven species could be regarded as hedgerow specialists: Dunnock Prunella modularis, Whitethroat Sylvia communis, Lesser Whitethroat S. curruca, Linnet Carduelis cannabina, Goldfinch C. carduelis, Greenfinch C. chloris and Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella. Species showing clear preferences for woodland were: Tawny Owl Strix aluco, Marsh Tit Parus palustris, Coal Tit P. ater, Goldcrest Regulus regulus, Spotted Flycatcher Muscicapa striata, Treecreeper Certhia familiaris, Nuthatch Sirra europaea, Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major, Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita and Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla. The habitat needs of the hedgerow specialists show considerable variation and do not always coincide with the hedgerow structures that support the greatest numbers of bird species and highest densities of birds. Management strategies that maintain a diversity of hedgerow structures are, therefore, desirable. Hedgerow and woodland bird communities are essentially complementary and habitat creation initiatives in lowland agricultural landscapes should not be excessively weighted towards one habitat or the other. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.","2001","2020-10-29 20:10:19","2020-10-29 20:10:19","","79-92","","","84","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","England and Wales; eppi-reviewer4; Species richness; Bird community; Farmland birds; Hedgerow; Woodland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As far as possible, predictors were sought that were consistent in their effects over a 20 yr period. The data were derived from mapping censuses in 1966, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1982 and 1986 with yearly sample sizes ranging from 41 to 51 plots, of minimum size of 50 ha. Landscape composition was quantified in terms of 10 landscape variables representing broad structural (e.g. density of woodland) and crop attributes (e.g. proportion of area under cereals) plus attitude. Gradients in bird community composition were defined as plot scores on axis 1 of a detrended correspondence composition were defined as plot scores on axis 1 of a detrended correspondence analysis (AXIS1). This gradient consistently represented a gradient from plots rich in woodland bird species to ones rich in field-feeding and wetland species. Multiple regression was used to build models containing, 2-, 3- and 4-variables. Two approaches were used to combine data from the six years and models based on the single best subset in each year were found to be most consistent with respect to predictor selection. Predictors were tested by building models based on each combination of five years and assessing how well the predictors explained variation in the bird variables for the sixth, how well the predictors explained variation in the bird variables for the sixth, independent year. The predictors were relatively successful in explaining variations in densities of wren, robin, willow warbler, blue tit, great tit and chaffinch but especially AXIS1 which was explained in terms of woodland density, field size and altitude. The predictors were unsuccessful in explaining total bird density, song thrush density and whitethroat density. Structural attributes of landscape (especially density of hedgerow and woodland, but also rivers and ponds) were frequent predictors of species densities, but variables relating to farming system were not, with the exception of skylark and yellowhammer which were positively associated with extent of cereal crops. Implications for landscape design and management, and the relative contribution of woodland and hedgerows to bird communities in farmland landscapes are discussed. There was considerable variation between individual years which suggests that models of bird-habitat relationships based on single years may have limited general application.","1997","2020-10-29 20:10:20","2021-10-19 13:14:18","","295-307","","","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

M.","Using GIS to Quantify Riparian Buffer Bypassing on Agricultural Fields in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed","","","","","","Forested riparian buffers are intended to reduce the sediment and nutrient loads to streams delivered by agricultural runoff. Within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, buffers are mandated to be 100’ wide along agricultural f ields bordered by perennial streams. When flow into buffers is widely disseminated buffers have the potential to significantly reduce pollutant levels entering streams. However, several studies show that flow across buffers is often concentrated, producing channelized flow that bypasses the buffer and presumably reduces buffer effectiveness. Previous studies have relied on field observations in relatively few locations, however, and the extent of bypassing is not well constrained. We hypothesize that buffer bypassing and the associated reduction in buffer effectiveness is a widespread phenomenon. Here we use GIS to determine flow patterns on agricultural fields and to identify locations of concentrated flow through buffers in the Virginia Coastal Plain withi n the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. Using DEMs with ≤10m resolution, we determine flow accumulation along field margins and identify points with flow accumulation sufficient to generate concentrated flow into buffers. Flow accumulation data from 27 fields has shown that 51 % to 91% of the total area draining to the field margins pass through 10 discrete points , representing <1 % of the field margin length. Using i n - field observations we have located channels and surface flow evidence within riparian buffers and u sing GIS we have generated a slope/area relationship at these locations. Our results show a relationship of decreasing slope with increasing area necessary for channel initiation at the buffer. GIS flow accumulation and slope data should be used as precision tool s in the placement of riparian buffers to maximize buffer effectiveness and reduce buffer - bypassing.","2011","2020-10-29 20:10:20","2020-10-29 20:10:20","","","1347","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publication Title: AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts Volume: 1","","","","eppi-reviewer4; Bachelor of Science in Geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The barrier was comprised of a planting of three rows of hybrid poplar, Populus deltoides Bartr. × Populus nigra L., one row of Italian alder, Alnus cordata L. (nectar reward), and one row of white pine, Pinus strobus L. The hedgerow completely surrounded the perimeter of the apple orchard and was treated with garlic and a low rate of pyrethroid insecticide in 4 of the 5 years. The Enhanced IPM program significantly reduced G. molesta populations as measured by moth captures in pheromone traps. Captures of G. molesta were significantly higher in apple orchards treated with OP and carbamate insecticides, 'Conventional IPM', and either not surrounded by the hedgerow or with the barrier present but not treated with the repellent compounds. To explain these differences in G. molesta control, and the potential non-lethal effect of hedgerow barriers on G. molesta orchard colonization, we studied the adult vertical movement in a traditional unsprayed standard apple orchard at three different heights: 0.95, 1.95 and 3.20 m, respectively. In the overwintering generation at a height of 0.95 and 1.95 m, the mean number of moths captured per sampling period was 14.64 and 14.84, respectively, and only 2.95 at 3.20 m. However, the number of individuals captured in the second and third generations was not significantly different at the three different heights. Fruit damage evaluated before 'June drop' closely corresponded to the distribution of moths captured during the overwintering generation. Fruit damage at a height of 1.95 and 3.20m was 5.8 and 3.5%, respectively. These results indicated that G. molesta is a weak flyer and that hedgerow barriers exerted some influence in the colonization of the orchard by limiting the free movement of adults from the overwintering generation. Thus, hedgerow barriers seem to limit early migration and establishment of G. molesta in the orchard. This in turn may reduce the size of the following generations and makes subsequent control easier under the Enhanced IPM program. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.","2007","2020-10-29 20:10:22","2021-10-19 13:14:17","","181-188","","","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Species richness of Orthoptera was significantly higher on headland footpaths (6 species) than on crossfield rights of way (3 species), suggesting that footpaths along the edges of fields may provide refuges in arable farmland. It seems that the absence of regular ploughing on the headland footpaths may be beneficial to mesophilous grasshopper species, the crossfield footpaths constituting too much of an ephemeral habitat (due to annual Ploughing and cropping) to support the full range of species.

Many natural enemies hibernate in non-crop habitats, from which they may colonise arable fields in the spring. Spring colonisation ensures annual repopulation of the crop with natural enemies, allowing them to keep pace with the development of pest populations. The availability of non-crop habitats can, therefore, be crucial to successful conservation biological control. We quantified the density of overwintering natural enemies near organic Brussels sprout crops in five different non-crop habitats (short grassy field margin, herbaceous field margin, herbaceous field margin under a tree line, ditch and forest). Soil and litter samples of non-crop habitats were taken at two sites. One site was located in an open agricultural landscape, the other in a landscape dominated by mixed forest. Insects belonging to Staphylinidae, Araneae, Carabidae, Coccinellidae and Dermaptera were the most abundant. Mean densities of predatory arthropods were higher in the open agricultural landscape (290 predators m(-2)) than in the forested landscape (137 predators m(-2)). Herbaceous habitat types supported the highest densities of overwintering predators (up to 400 predators m(-2)), whereas densities in the forest were lowest (10 predators m(-2)). These results indicate that herbaceous non-crop habitats are important refugia for predators and may play a vital role in conservation biological control.","2009","2020-10-29 20:10:24","2021-10-19 13:14:12","","529-535","","","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using three elements of landscape structure, we explored whether variation was best explained by the Random Sample Hypothesis (that small islands represent a random sample of those species populating larger areas), or by the Fragmentation Hypothesis (that species abundance will decrease with a loss of habitat area). We tested the relationship between the relative abundance of small mammals and 1. hedgerow connectivity; 2. total habitat availability and 3. local habitat complexity. We then explored the predictive power of combinations of these habitat variables. Connectivity was a positive predictor of wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus, and hedgerow gappiness was a negative predictor of bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus.

When rain falls on burnt pastures, it can lead to increased pollutant transport in runoff. However, this transport can be modified by vegetative buffers which intercept the runoff downslope of burnt areas. This study examines the effects of different pasture buffer lengths (0, 2, and 5 m) on sediment and chemical transport from two pasture sites near Wivenhoe Dam, the main water reservoir for Brisbane City. Simulated rainfall (100 mm/h) was applied to 18 plots on pasture sites after they were burnt, and insoluble and soluble components were measured in the runoff. Most eroded sediment/organic debris accumulated against the first row of the grass buffer strips or was deposited in the upslope backwater region. Buffer length had little impact on the runoff concentrations of NO(3)(-) and NO(2)(-) (NO(x)), total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and total nitrogen from the 5-m-length upslope plots but was significant for sediment loss rate, filterable reactive phosphate, ammonium, and total and dissolved organic carbon. Pasture type was significant for NO(x), ammonium, sediment loss rate, and total organic carbon only. Burning increased enrichment ratios of nutrients and carbon in the runoff compared with unburnt plots, but a 2-m buffer strip subsequently reduced the enrichment ratio values by > 30%. Buffers strips of unburnt pasture grass may provide an effective tool for post-fire erosion control following prescribed burning; however, further work including scaling to larger plot sizes and catchment level is required.","2011","2020-10-29 20:10:25","2021-10-19 13:13:45","","513-522","","","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Knowledge about the hydrological role of hedgerows is useful in many fields of study, such as hydrological modelling and rural landscape management. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a hedgerow on rainfall distribution, soil-water potential gradient, lateral water transfer and water balance. A hillslope with a hedgerow perpendicular to the slope was monitored. To evaluate hedgerow rainfall interception, rainfall was measured (hourly, daily, and by rainfall event) both next to and up to 16 m upslope and 12 m downslope perpendicularly away from the hedgerow. The strongest correlation between rainfall next to the hedgerow and rainfall at more distant points was obtained using data measured per rainfall event. The average percentage of rainfall intercepted equalled 28% for the leafed period and 12% for the leafless period. The impact of the hedgerow on spatial rainfall distribution was related to distance from the hedgerow and rainfall amount. Annual distribution of soil-water potential showed that the hedgerow influenced it up to 9 m upslope and 6 m downslope, the area in which most of the hedgerow's roots were observed. The soil was driest at the end of summer, which delayed soil rewetting during autumn in areas surrounding the hedgerow. Annual groundwater dynamics exhibited three distinct periods due to temporal rainfall distribution and, especially at the end of summer, root-water uptake. In addition, the total potential gradient showed that unsaturated flow was directed towards the hedgerow in summer and autumn. These results indicate that at the local scale hedgerows influences (1) spatial rainfall distribution, (2) soil rewetting, and (3) groundwater recharge, often at distances well beyond the hedgerow's drip line. Consequently, the processes involved in soil-water dynamics around hedgerows should be integrated into relevant hydrological models, especially for catchments with a dense hedgerow network.

Soil water movement was investigated in a hillslope crossed by a hedgerow using total water-potential gradients and shallow groundwater dynamics. Results of a dry year were presented by Ghazavi et al. (2008). In this study, we analyse a wet year and then compare the two contrasting years (dry and wet). During the 2 years, the soil located at the vicinity of the hedgerow developed a drier status than the surrounding soils. Water flux in the unsaturated zone was directed towards the hedgerow for a longer period during the dry year than the wet year. The duration of delayed rewetting of the soil decreased from 3 months for the dry year to 1 month for the wet year. Variation in water storage calculated over the study period was highest near the hedgerow and lowest far from the hedgerow. In the hillslope studied, hedgerow and stream proximity controlled water transfer. It is clear that the hedgerow controlled water transfer in the unsaturated zone throughout the year, except for the period when the soil profile was fully saturated. First, hedgerows control water transfer by increasing lateral transfer, which is related to high soil water potential gradients in its vicinity. These processes may increase capillary rise and decrease groundwater recharge near the hedgerow. Second, reverse hydraulic gradient (upward flux of water) occurred during the period of lowest groundwater level, mainly because of groundwater and stream connectivity. Processes related to hedgerow presence, such as delayed soil rewetting and flow towards the hedgerow need to be considered to quantify the impact of linear vegetation structures on water flux. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","2011","2020-10-29 20:10:28","2021-10-19 13:14:45","","1431-1442","","","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Beneficial insects that supply these services to agricultural lands are threatened by limited or suboptimal resources due to the loss of biodiversity in agroecosystems, which is a growing concern in agricultural states like Iowa. Conservation practices are recommended to address a multitude of conservation concerns related to Iowa's declining natural resources; however, guidelines for best practices that conserve beneficial insects are not well defined. Due to the valuable relationship of beneficial insects and successful crop production, there is a need for developing best practices that conserve beneficial insects within Iowa's agricultural landscape. The first objective was to design mixtures of native perennial plants that range in diversity and resource availability and evaluate these different plant communities as candidates for buffer strips that attract and conserve beneficial insects. The second objective was to evaluate the insect community in non-crop buffer strips already established on organic farms and in the adjacent organic crops and conventional row crops. This research seeks to identify mixtures of native perennial plants optimized with resources attractive to pollinators and natural enemies and to determine if these mixtures can enhance Iowa's buffer strips to conserve beneficial insects and protect their services. Best-practices for conserving beneficial insects can be adapted for different regions, land uses, and habitat restoration scenarios beyond the study system used for this research.","2013","2020-10-29 20:10:29","2020-11-06 22:46:43","","","152","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9781303167249","","","","Agriculture; Ecology; Biological sciences; 0329:Ecology; Conservation; 0473:Agriculture; eppi-reviewer4; 0353:Entomology; Entomology; 0408:Conservation; Beneficial insects; Buffer strips; Habitat restoration; MSc; Native plants; Organic; Perennial habitat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Guidelines for establishment of filter strips in the Midwest region of the US are few with respect to the interplanting of fine hardwood tree species that can provide additional income to farm owners as well as site protection. This study was undertaken to discern the effects of different herbaceous cover types on tree growth and survival when interplanted. Ladino clover (Trifolium repens L.) and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) were sown and seedlings of three tree species, green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh.), black walnut (Juglans nigra L.), and red oak (Quercus nigra L.) were planted within each cover type to examine the performance of these integrated cover-tree systems. A series of plots containing the native mix of annual and perennial weed species was used as a control. Height and stem caliper of the trees were taken for 4 years. Additionally, habitat quality for bird species was assessed with respect to the corn (Zea mays L.) crop the filter strips replaced. Results indicated that cover type had little influence on tree growth and survival when weed control adjacent to seedlings was effective. Compared with the native weed population, clover and grass covers allowed equal height growth of trees, providing no greater competition but higher management costs. For habitat quality, filter strips provided better habitat for birds when compared with corn. Thus, the construction of filter strips with tree species along streams or drainage ditches can take several forms that can serve to filter excess nutrients and sediment.","1995","2020-10-29 20:10:31","2021-10-19 13:13:51","","263-270","","","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data were extracted from 11 farms surveyed by territory mapping between 1966 and 1986 as part of the British Trust for Ornithology's Common Birds Census. The population size of 38 bird species was quantified for each farm in each year. The extents of five non-crop habitats were measured at 4-yearly intervals on each farm. The farms were selected because some had undergone extensive removal of non-crop habitats while others had undergone little or none. Although declines were commonest on farms where the severest habitat loss had taken place, we found no evidence that habitat loss was the main factor causing population declines: all 11 farms had significant numbers of declining species, even where habitat loss was minimal. Furthermore, general linear modelling found no significant effects of habitat loss on population trends and principal-components analysis found limited effects of habitat extent on community composition. These results suggest that habitat loss is of secondary importance in causing farmland bird population declines. We suggest that other processes, such as habitat degradation, may have caused a baseline population decline in at least 10 farmland bird species and that declines may have been exacerbated by localised habitat loss.","1998","2020-10-29 20:10:34","2020-10-29 20:10:34","","120-127","","","116","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4; Hedgerows; Habitat loss; Farmland birds; Habitat degradation; Population declines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To test these hypotheses, we radiotracked 14 R. euryale from the largest known breeding colony of northern Iberian Peninsula and determined their habitat selection, spatial foraging pattern, and hunting behaviour. Our predictions on habitat selection, as well as on the foraging site size and on commuting range were confirmed. Rhinolophus euryale used almost exclusively native deciduous woodland, and hedgerows were positively selected.

In the policy context buffer strips are referred to as land with defined farming restrictions aiming at protecting the water course. In the current EU agricultural policy framework the majority of the decisions regarding subsidy schemes for buffer strips is taken on the member country level, which results in great differences between the EU members with regard to this water protection measure. If incentives for farmers for establishing and maintaining buffer strips are in place, they are usually linked to the harvest ban on the buffer strip. Such protection model can be endangered by volatile and rising prices for agricultural products. However, buffer strip can represent a valuable source of different ecosystem services, including biomass provision. If harvesting under certain restrictions would be allowed, the biomass could generate additional revenue that might contribute to securing buffer strips existence and consequently maintaining their protection function.This study aimed at assessing the costs and environmental consequences of biomass mobilizing from buffer strips. It dealt with different scenarios of biomass sourcing from extensively cultivated buffer strips in the Netherlands. In 12 scenarios, the cultivation of grass or cereal mixes (including multiple harvesting or perennial cultivation) for different valorisation chains (ensiling or fodder & bedding) was assessed. Both total net cultivation costs as well as the hectare based environmental performance (using the Life Cycle Assessment methodology) were evaluated. Additionally, the environmental impact of electricity production through anaerobic digestion of biomass from buffer strips was compared with the impact from digestion of classic grass silage and the impact profile of Dutch electricity mix.The results indicate ensiling as the scenario generating more net costs and higher environmental impacts as compared to fodder & bedding. In the latter, the cereal cultivation represents a better solution from economic perspective, while grass shows lower environmental impacts. Moreover, optimizing grass cultivation through switching to perennial mode contributes to strong improvements of the economic performance and contributes to additional reduction of environmental impacts, and consequently delivers the best environmental and economic solution. Moreover, the comparison with the Dutch electricity mix shows that biomass from buffer strips, if used in anaerobic digestion, can, in terms of environmental performance, compete with classic silages and contribute to reduced environmental damage. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","2016","2020-10-29 20:10:36","2021-10-19 13:13:54","","31-39","","","57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Riparian management has been embraced by water and land managers globally to offset the deleterious effects of intensive agricultural land use on aquatic ecosystems. However, the documented responses of stream communities to riparian management have been variable, particularly in highly degraded systems. 2. We used boosted regression trees and structural equation models to assess the effects of riparian condition and stream size on the invertebrate communities of 64 agricultural waterways on the Canterbury Plains, New Zealand. We hypothesized that small streams would be more degraded than larger waterways but would show a greater increase in the abundance of pollution-sensitive aquatic invertebrates in response to riparian management. We also predicted that land-use legacies of poor in-streamhabitat would reduce the effectiveness of current riparian management. The two strongest determinants of community structure were primarily in-stream habitat, where sedimentation and low water velocity had negative impacts on stream communities, and stream size, with smaller waterways generally more impacted than large waterways. Not surprisingly, with > 150 years of agriculture and patchy riparian management on the plains, current management has not greatly improved in-stream habitat and thus had little effect on the abundance of sensitive aquatic insect (EPT) taxa. 3. Managed streams did, however, have more pollution-sensitive communities in general. This was largely mediated by decreased stream temperature, narrower/deeper channels and greater organic matter resources in streams with riparian planting and restricted stock access. Thus, if water velocity and sedimentation issues can be mitigated, then riparian management should become more effective. 4. Synthesis and applications. Within the context of a degraded agricultural landscape, we identified factors limiting the effectiveness of riparian management for stream invertebrate communities. Riparian management should primarily target and protect small streams and those without degraded in-stream habitat. Intensive management, such as in-stream habitat or channel morphology modification, may be needed to address historical factors (e.g. low velocity and sedimentation), which otherwise may continue to limit community recovery.","2012","2020-10-29 20:10:40","2021-10-19 13:14:09","","213-222","","","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Grass seed cropping systems are intensely managed with inorganic fertilizers to sustain production. Much of the land where grass seed production occurs in western Oregon is marginally productive for most other crops because of the poorly drained soil conditions. The role of riparian areas bordering grass seed fields in moderating surface water and groundwater quality is not well understood. A study sire in western Oregon was instrumented to determine how riparian areas bordering grass seed fields process N and thereby influence water quality. The site consisted of a perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) seed field, a riparian area, and an intermittent creek. Groundwater levels were monitored during the fall of 1995 to the late spring of 1996 and a complete set of samples were collected every two weeks from wells with water and analyzed for NO3(-) and NH4(+). Total fertilizer applied to the crop was 200 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), Data indicated a lateral subsurface hydrologic flow path from the cultivated field through the riparian zone, to the creek. Averaged over the season (November 1995 - June 1996), riparian zone A and C horizon groundwater mean NO3(-) concentration was mostly undetectable and less than 3.8 mg L-1 in the agricultural field. At all sampling concentration was higher in the field than in the riparian zone. Seasonal mean groundwater NH4(+) concentrations for the riparian and field A and C horizons were less than or equal to 0.2 mg L-1, Annual crop net N accumulation was 144 kg N ha(-1). Riparian soil electrode potentials (Eh) at 25 and 45 cm averaged -200 to -100 mV during the wet cycle, whereas the field ranged between 0 to +50 mV. Collectively, findings indicate that both crop and riparian processes at the Lake Creek site are responsible for reducing shallow groundwater NO3(-) to low levels.","1997","2020-10-29 20:10:41","2021-10-19 13:14:30","","1025-1030","","","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to analyse the spatial and seasonal influences of a hedgerow on nitrate dynamics in the soil and groundwater. Nitrate (NO 3 -) and chloride (Cl -) concentrations were measured with spatially dense sampling in the unsaturated soil and in the groundwater along a transect intersecting a bottomland oak (Quercus rubor) hedgerow after the growing season and during the dormant season. We explain NO 3 - dynamics by using Cl - as an index of tree-root extension and water transfer. At the end of the growing season, NO 3 - is entirely absorbed by the trees over a large and deep volume corresponding to the rooting zone, where, in contrast Cl - is highly concentrated due to root exclusion. However, these observed patterns in the soil have no influence on the deep groundwater composition at this season. During the dormant season, water transfer processes feeding the shallow groundwater layer are different upslope and downslope from the hedgerow in relation to the thickness of the unsaturated zone. Upslope, the shallow groundwater is fed by rainwater infiltration through the soil which favours Cl - dilution. Right under the hedge and downslope, the rapid ascent of the groundwater near the ground surface prevents rainwater input and Cl - dilution. Under the hedgerow the highest concentrations of Cl - coincide with the absence of NO 3 - in the shallow groundwater layer and with high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon. The absence of NO 3 - during the dormant season seems to be due to denitrification in the hedgerow rooting zone when it is rapidly saturated by groundwater. © 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","2012","2020-10-29 20:10:42","2021-10-19 13:14:26","","3570-3578","","","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared to herbaceous vegetation, high transpiration rates are measured for isolated trees, shelterbelts or hedgerows. This article deals with the influence of a tree hedge on the soil and groundwater Cl- concentrations and the possibility of using Cl- as an indicator of transpiration and water movements near the tree rows. Cl- concentrations were measured over 1 year at different depths in the unsaturated zone and in the groundwater along a transect intersecting a bottomland oak hedge. We observed a strong spatial heterogeneity of Cl- concentrations, with very high values up to 2 g l-1 in the unsaturated zone and 1.2 g l-1 in the upper part of the groundwater. This contrasts with the low and homogeneous concentrations (60-70 mg l-1) in the deeper part of the groundwater. Cl- accumulation in the unsaturated zone at the end of the vegetation season allows us to identify the active root zone extension of trees. In winter, upslope of the tree row, downwards leaching partly renews the soil solution in the root zone, while the slow water movement under the trees or farther downslope results in Cl- accumulation and leads to a salinization of the soil and groundwater. This salinization is of the same order as experimental conditions produce negative effects on oak seedlings. The measurement of Cl- concentrations in the unsaturated zone under tree rows at the end of the vegetation season would indicate whether certain topographic, pedological or climatic conditions are likely to favour a strong salinization of the soil, as observed in the present study.

Th is management practice is also benefi cial for controlling manure- borne pathogen transport to surface water. Th e objective of this work was to assess the VFS effi ciency and evaluate the uncertainty in predicting the microbial pollutant removal from overland fl ow in VFS. We used the kinematic wave overland fl ow model as implemented in KINEROS2 coupled with the convective-dispersive overland transport model which accounts for the reversible attachment-detachment and surface straining of infi ltrating bacteria. Th e model was successfully calibrated with experimental data obtained from a series of simulated rainfall experiments at vegetated and bare sandy loam and clay loam plots, where fecal coliforms were released from manure slurry applied on the top of the plots. Th e calibrated model was then used to assess the sensitivity of the VFS effi ciency to the model parameters, rainfall duration, and intensity for a case study with a 6-m VFS placed at the edge of 200-m long fi eld. Th e Monte Carlo simulations were also performed to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the VFS effi ciency given the uncertainty in the model parameters and key inputs. Th e VFS effi ciency was found to be <95% in 25%, <75% in 23%, and <25% in 20% of cases. Relatively long high-intensity rainfalls, low hydraulic conductivities, low net capillary drives of soil, and high soil moisture contents before rainfalls caused the partial failure of VFS to retain coliforms from the infi ltration excess runoff .","2009","2020-10-29 20:10:43","2020-10-29 20:10:43","","1636-1644","","4","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Riparian buffers reduce nonpoint source pollution in agroecosystems by storing and cycling nutrients, stabilizing streambanks, increasing infiltration, and storing water. Specific information regarding riparian buffer management is needed for land managers to maximize buffer effectiveness at reducing agricultural contaminants impairing water quality. Baseline soil properties (texture, pH, C and nutrients) of the riparian buffer surrounding a tributary of Cane Run Creek in Fayette County, KY were characterized prior to imposing three mowing regimes (intense, moderate, and no mow treatments) and one native grass regime. Measurements were made along parallel transects located 2-m and 8-m distances from the stream. Root biomass, aggregate distribution, and saturated hydraulic conductivity were measured along the 2-m transect in two consecutive years following treatment establishment. The 2-m transect soils had the highest C, pH, Ca, Zn, and sand content. The 8-m transect had the highest P, K, Mg, and clay content. Semivariogram analysis of C content indicated slight to moderate spatial dependency along the 2m transect and moderate to strong spatial dependency along the 8m transect. Root biomass increased with decreased mowing frequency at the surface depth after one year; the native grass treatment had significantly less root biomass in both years compared to mowing treatments. There was no significant treatment effect on aggregate size distribution at the surface depth in either year. Mean weight diameter and large macroaggregates decreased from 2011 to 2012. Vegetation treatment had no statistically significant effect on water stable aggregates or saturated hydraulic conductivity. Experimental semivariograms provided evidence of spatial structure at multiple scales in root biomass, aggregates, and soil C. Spatial variability occurred over a shorter lag distance in 2012 than 2011, suggesting an effect of imposed treatments slowly developing over time.","2013","2020-10-29 20:10:44","2020-10-29 20:10:44","","","153","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9781321192254","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the longer-term effects on P removal in VBSs following application of products such as Al-WTR remain uncertain. We used field experimental plots to examine the long-term effects of applying a freshly generated Al-WTR to VBSs on dissolved P export during multiple runoff events, occurring between 1 day and 42 weeks after the application of Al-WTR. Vegetated buffer strip plots amended with Al-WTR significantly reduced soluble reactive P and total dissolved P concentrations in surface runoff compared to both unamended VBS plots and control plots. However, the effectiveness of Al-WTR decreased over time, by approximately 70 % after 42 weeks compared to a day following Al-WTR application. Reduced performance did not appear to be due to drying of Al-WTR in the field. Instead, the development of preferential flow paths as well as burying of Al-WTR with freshly deposited sediments may explain these observations. Better understanding of the processes controlling long-term P removal by Al-WTR is required for effective management of VBSs.","2015","2020-10-29 20:10:46","2021-10-19 13:14:22","","6068-6076","","","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Effective landscape management for functionally important organisms suffers from little understanding of organism spillover between semi-natural habitats and adjacent crops, and of how it is affected by the surrounding landscape., We examined syrphid abundance (Diptera: Syrphidae) in three types of linear semi-natural habitats, differing in connectedness to annual crops and forest [forest edges ( n = 12), forest-connected hedges ( n = 11) and isolated hedges ( n = 12)], as well as in the adjacent oilseed rape or winter wheat fields (i.e. altogether n = 70 sites in 35 landscapes). The landscape circles with 1 km radius around the study sites differed in the proportion of oilseed rape (ranging from 0% to 35% oilseed rape) enabling us to test landscape-scale effects of oilseed rape., Aphidophagous syrphids were more abundant in forest-connected hedgerows than in forest edges (with isolated hedges being intermediate), and more abundant in crop fields adjacent to hedgerows than adjacent to forest edges, indicating spillover from semi-natural habitats to the adjacent crop fields. Aphidophagous syrphid abundance was higher in semi-natural habitats adjacent to oilseed rape fields than adjacent to wheat fields if the proportion of oilseed rape in the landscape was low (indicating local concentration)., Synthesis and applications. This study highlights the potential of hedgerows to enhance the abundances of beneficial syrphids and their spillover to adjacent crop fields, especially when they are connected with forests. We provide evidence that this local exchange is moderated by the extent of mass-flowering crops in the surrounding landscapes due to local concentration. Therefore, measurements for the improvement in local biological functioning should be evaluated by simultaneously investigating local and regional aspects of crop configurations to allow for region-specific management recommendations. Increasing the total amount of hedgerows in the agricultural matrix under moderate landscape-scale proportions of mass-flowering crops may serve best for the conservation of biodiversity and augmentation of important ecosystem services such as biological control and pollination in landscapes dominated by agricultural cultivations.

The structural complexity of agricultural landscapes influences the local biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Hence, developing effective biodiversity management requires a better understanding of the relative importance of local and landscape changes, especially for functionally important organisms such as hoverflies benefiting from flowering plants. 2. We examined hoverfly (Diptera: Syrphidae) communities in broad and narrow sown flower strips, in naturally developed grassy strips and in wheat fields (as a control). We also investigated the effects of these four habitat types on syrphid occurrence in the adjacent wheat fields. 3. The relative influence of local vs. landscape effects was tested by selecting study sites along a gradient of structural complexity from simple landscapes (∼100% arable land) to complex landscapes (up to 70% semi-natural habitats such as fallows, field margins, hedges and grassland). Landscape complexity was assessed within landscape sectors of 0·5–4·0 km radius around strips. 4. Syrphid density and in particular, the density of aphidophagous species, was higher in narrow and broad sown flower strips compared to grassy strips and wheat–wheat boundary controls at the milk-ripening stage of the wheat. In addition, species richness of aphidophagous syrphids within wheat fields adjacent to broad sown flower strips was higher at the wheat peak-ripening stage. This indicates a spillover between habitats and a positive effect of these sown flower strips on potential biocontrol of cereal aphids. Flower densities and syrphid diversity and density, respectively, were closely related. 5. Species richness and abundance in the sown flower strips increased as the proportion of arable land in the surrounding landscape increased, suggesting that within structurally simple landscapes (at 0·5–1 km radius around the sites) syrphid flies concentrated on the most rewarding resources within the sown flower strips. Sown flower strips were more effective at increasing syrphid species richness and abundance in simple landscapes, presumably because the creation of flower resources made the greatest difference in such homogeneous, intensively managed arable landscapes. 6. Synthesis and applications. Agri-environment schemes should take the surrounding landscape characteristics into account when considering using sown flower strips to enhance syrphid density and diversity, and their biocontrol function, in arable landscapes. Creating locally such flower strips is more effective in simple landscapes containing a high proportion of arable land, while in complex landscapes, keeping the overall diversity is important.

Prescribed fire, which tends to maintain or increase perennial grass cover, may be a better option than disking for managing native grass buffers where fire ant densities are high.","2011","2020-10-29 20:10:48","2021-10-19 13:14:00","","283-291","","","166","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A previous study reveals high chloride (Cl) accumulation in the soil under a bottomland oak hedgerow in western France. Our study tests whether Cl can be used as an indicator of the spatial extent of tree root activity. Methods: Cl was analyzed in soil profiles up to 2 m deep along transects perpendicular to hedgerows. One site was explored in detail to examine the role of hedgerow position on the slope, supplemented with multi-annual and multi-site studies on bottomland hedgerows. Results: Upslope Cl accumulation was highest near the tree line (and up to 6 m away) and around 1 m deep. Downslope it extended up to 18 m from the tree line and near the surface. This difference was caused by differences in water availability or physical soil constraints. Cl accumulation was found in both temporal (multi-annual) and spatial (multi-site) studies. Conclusions: Cl accumulation under oak hedgerows can be used to identify the lateral extent and depth of water uptake by roots. It results from root activity over many years. The method is more suitable for poorly drained soils.

These zones may effectively reduce the nitrate-N load in shallow ground water draining intensively fertilized agricultural regions. Contemporary research has tended to focus on wide, forested riparian zones situated on poorly drained lowland sites. In addition, research has typically focused on the growing season, when the ecosystem is biologically active, with relatively dry hydrological conditions. This field study monitored spatial and temporal patterns of nitrate-N in a comparatively narrow, non-forested buffer zone situated in an upland agricultural watershed in southern Ontario. Results show that the nitrate attenuation ability of the buffer zone is spatially and temporally variable. At one site, the buffer zone consistently reduced concentrations of nitrate from input values greater than 10 mg/l, to less than 1 mg/l. At another site, located only 200 m up stream, the reduction of nitrate concentrations was much less. However, the rate of nitrate attenuation in terms of mass was similar at both sites. Temporal variations were observed in the nitrate attenuation ability of both sites. While the ratio of nitrate removed to nitrate input decreased during the dormant season, the actual mass removed increased. Differences in hydrogeological structure and land use associated with the two sites are likely responsible for the different attenuation patterns.","1999","2020-10-29 20:10:50","2020-10-29 20:10:50","","","305-305 p.","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9780612403352; 0612403351","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ar different distances from the weed strips and from the field edge, respectively, pest insects and their antagonists were registered by visual control and by sweep netting in 1993 and 1994. The dominant pest insects were cereal aphids and leaf beetles. The infestation with aphids was always very low and did not show any differences between the studied distances from the weed strip. In 1993, the cereal leaf beetles were more numerous in the field without strip than in the strip-managed ones and at the beginning of their incidence in 1994, they were significantly more numerous in the middle of the Field than close to the weed strip. Consequently, cereal crop was not more infested with pest insects near a weed strip than in the rest of the field. Predatory arthropods such as spiders, Nabidae and Dolichopodidae were found in larger numbers near the weed strips than in the middle of the Grids. However, parasitic Hymenoptera were mostly equally distributed over the whole fields. The number of aphidophagous predators was not significantly different between the studied distances in the wheat fields, but they were often more abundant in the strip-managed fields than in the field without a strip. There were fewer aphids per larvae of syrphids near the sown weed strips than in the middle of the fields and this predator-prey relationship was also closer and, consequently, better in the strip-managed fields than in the field without a strip. Thus, an enhancing effect of beneficial arthropods by sown weed strips on the adjacent wheat fields and a reduction of pest insects could be shown.","1996","2020-10-29 20:10:52","2020-10-29 20:10:52","","70-81","","","103","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rape pests which are known to populate the fields from the edges might be augmented by sown weed strips. To evaluate whether weed strips have a negative impact on rape crop, insect pests and their antagonists were studied in a winter rape held near Berne, Switzerland, divided into two parts by a sown weed strip. They were registered at different distances from the weed strip and from the opposite field boundary in 1993. The pollen beetle Meligethes sp. and the cabbage weevils Ceutorhynchus assimilis Payk., C. napi Gyll. and C. pallidactylus Marsh. and the brassica pod midge Dasineura brassicae Winn. were significantly more frequent near the held boundary than in the middle of the field and close to the sown weed strip. This could be because a sown weed strip does not act as a real field edge. For the investigated rape pods, little difference was observed as to the rate of infestation of C. assimilis. It was astonishing that only a few predators were caught by sweep netting in the whole held as well as close to the weed strip. A higher number of parasitoids near the sown weed strip could not be found either, which was probably due to their high mobility. The low rate of parasitization of the rape pests was only once assessed clearly higher near the weed strip than in the rest of the field. Therefore, flower visiting predators and parasitoids might not have been efficiently increased the weed strip. Generally, no negative impact of the weed strip on rape crop was found and therefore sown weed strips could be suitable areas in a farming with crop rotation to diversity an agroecosystem.","1996","2020-10-29 20:10:52","2020-10-29 20:10:52","","505-512","","","120","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two sites, grass (Lolium perenne L.), and poplar (Populus italica)-vegetated riparian strips, were investigated in southern England (River Leach). Groundwater flow was via subsurface pathways within the sites, NO3- concentration gradients and loading rates were calculated over the winter period. Nitrate retention was found to be linearly dependent on load rate. Nitrate retention occurred at the edge of the riparian zone. This was most obvious in the poplar site where all hillslope-derived NO3 was absorbed within the first 5 m of flow within the riparian strip. When loading rates into the sites increased, NO3 absorption migrated upslope from the riparian site. The poplar-vegetated riparian zone was found to be more resilient (99% retention of NO3-) than the grass-vegetated riparian zone (84% retention of NO3-) in the winter months. It is postulated that although vegetation has no active role in retaining NO3- in the winter, above-ground vegetative biomass does contribute C to the soil microbacterial biomass that is engaged in NO3- reduction in the winter months, this accounted for the greater efficiency of the poplar vegetated site.","","2020-10-29 20:10:54","2021-10-19 13:14:00","","273-278","","","Apr/June 1993. v. 22 (2)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One promising solution has been to disperse channelized surface runoff in the receiving portion of the filter zone (FZ) with level spreaders. However, widespread adoption of level spreaders as a best management practice requires designs that are both functional and cost effective over a range of site characteristics including FZ condition and with varying sources of nonpoint-source pollution and under differing rates of loading. The main objective of this research was to evaluate different level spreader designs and configurations for dispersing channelized agricultural runoff and to evaluate them for enhancing FZ effectiveness on several sites with greatly differing watershed characteristics. Other objectives included estimating construction and maintenance costs and developing recommendations for level spreaders for specific watershed and FZ conditions. Level spreaders with associated instrumentation were constructed on eight watersheds from 1989 to 1997 representing a wide variety of watershed and FZ conditions. Spreaders without associated instrumentation were constructed on three watersheds. Source areas included crops under both conventional and conservation tillage, a pasture, a dry-lot for dairy cattle, and a paved and partly-roofed cattle containment area. Designs tested included commercial galvanized gutters, treated wood, fabric-lined ditches with gravel just above and below the ditch, and vegetated berm and trench. Reductions in NPSP through-puts were a function of filter zone size, input concentration, runoff volume, and season. Filter zones where FZ area was greater than two percent of source-area size generally removed a least a third of each analyte. Of the six sites with dispersed flow which did not have large unaccounted contributions to the FZ, only one failed to reduce N by 30 percent. All spreader designs improved FZ performance. Level spreaders with larger cross-sectional areas were more effective for high peak-flow events. The most easily maintained design is a vegetated berm and trench spreader shaped from soil. This design also allows limited vehicle traffic over the spreader.","2000","2020-10-29 20:10:54","2020-10-29 20:10:54","","","100-100 p.","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9780493465753; 0493465758","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Discharge from soil to ditch was temporarily collected in an in-stream reservoir to measure its quantity and quality, both for a BS and a reference (REF) treatment. Treatments were replicated once for the first, and three times for the next three leaching seasons. No significant BSE was obtained for nitrogen and phosphorus species in the reservoirs. Additionally, water samples were taken from the upper groundwater below the treatments. The effect of BS for nitrate was much bigger in upper groundwater than in the reservoirs that also collected groundwater from greater depths that were not influenced by the treatments. We conclude that measuring changes in upper groundwater to assess BSE is only valid under specific hydrogeological conditions. We propose an alternative experimental set-up for future research, including extra measurements before installing the BS and REF treatments to deal with spatial and temporal variability.

Riparian buffer strips are considered an effective means of attenuating concentrated nitrates in agricultural runoff. Whilst a large number of scientific investigations have focused on nitrate removal mechanisms, such as plant uptake and denitrification maximization in buffer zones, few have studied the effects that different soil management treatments have on drainage rates. The application of chloride tracer to soils under six different vegetative treatments from two differing soil textures produced breakthrough curves highlighting the dominant flow mechanisms for each management practice. Of the 18 breakthrough tracers determined, 9 exhibited a rapid macropore hydrology, 6 intermediate mesopore through-flow and three slow micropore flow. Solute breakthrough flow rate was significant between all vegetation and soil treatments (P< 0.05), indicating that both play an important role in the determination of drainage flow pathways and transport speed. Vegetation such as scrub, with a large root network, led to increased soil porosity, significantly increasing the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the maximum peak drainage rates of the soil. On the other hand, maize and grass treatments, with smaller and less dense root networks, exhibited lower soil porosity and hydraulic conductivity, increasing solute residence time within the soil matrix and hence a longer lag time to peak effluent concentration. Although many of the treatments on each soil texture were different, and so could not be directly compared, results suggested that optimal treatments were soil specific, but that grassed and maize buffer strips, on a soil with low saturated hydraulic conductivity, would provide the best compromise at mitigating solute drainage whilst maintaining management practicality.

Four treatments with PFS of different size and location (100% rowcrop, 10% PFS of total watershed area at footslope, 10% PFS at footslope and in contour strips, 20% PFS at footslope and in contour strips) arranged in a balanced incomplete block design were seeded in July 2007. All watersheds were in bromegrass (Bromus L.) for at least 10 yr before treatment establishment. Cropped areas were managed under a no-till, 2-yr corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max. (L.) Merr.] rotation beginning in 2007. About 38 to 85% of the total sediment export from cropland occurred during the early growth stage of rowcrop due to wet field conditions and poor ground cover. The greatest sediment load was observed in 2008 due to the initial soil disturbance and gradually decreased thereafter. The mean annual sediment yield through 2010 was 0.36 and 8.30 Mg ha(-1) for the watersheds with and without PFS, respectively, a 96% sediment trapping efficiency for the 4-yr study period. The amount and distribution of PFS had no significant impact on runoff and sediment yield, probably due to the relatively large width (37-78 m) of footslope PFS.

When modeling the hydrology of VF, it is often assumed that overland flow is planar but our research indicates that it can be two-dimensional with converging and diverging pathways. Our hypothesis is that flow convergence will negatively influence the sediment trapping capability of VF The objectives were to develop a two-dimensional modeling approach for estimating sediment trapping in VF and to investigate the impact of converging overland flow on sediment trapping by VF In this study, the performance of a VF that has field-scale flow path lengths with uncontrolled flow direction was quantified using field experiments and hydrologic modeling. Simulations of water flow processes were performed using the physically based, distributed model MIKE SHE. A modeling approach that predicts sediment trapping and accounts for converging and diverging flow was developed based on the University of Kentucky sediment filtration model. The results revealed that as flow convergence increases, filter performance decreases, and the impacts are greater at higher flow rates and shorter filter lengths. Convergence that occurs in the contributing field (in-field) upstream of the buffer had a slightly greater impact than convergence that occurred in the filter (in-filter). An area-based convergence ratio was defined that relates the actual flow area in a VF to the theoretical flow area without flow convergence. When the convergence ratio was 0.70, in-filter convergence caused the sediment trapping efficiency to be reduced from 80% for the planar flow condition to 64% for the converging flow condition. When an equivalent convergence occurred in-field, the sediment trapping efficiency was reduced to 57%. Thus, not only is convergence important but the location where convergence occurs can also be important.","2005","2020-10-29 20:10:59","2021-10-19 13:14:25","","541-555","","","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://www.crossref.org/openurl?pid=zoteroDOI@wiernik.org&url_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fzotero.org%3A2&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=Modeling%20sediment%20trapping%20in%20a%20vegetative%20filter%20accounting%20for%20converging%20overland%20flow&rft.jtitle=Transactions%20of%20the%20Asae&rft.volume=48&rft.aufirst=M.%20J.&rft.aulast=Helmers&rft.au=M.%20J.%20Helmers&rft.au=D.%20E.%20Eisenhauer&rft.au=T.%20G.%20Franti&rft.au=M.%20G.%20Dosskey&rft.date=2005&rft.pages=541-555&rft.spage=541&rft.epage=555&rft.issn=0001-2351","eppi-reviewer4","❓ Multiple DOI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Agricultural intensification and loss of wild floral resources rank among the main factors contributing to this decline. Landscape enhancement of floral resources has been proposed as an agro-environmental scheme intended to provide honeybees with compensatory food sources in intensive agrosystems. Floral scheme efficiency has rarely been evaluated with respect to landscape context. In this study, we developed and validated a modeling tool to delineate the landscape areas likely to be associated with higher efficiency of floral enhancement schemes. In particular, the proximity of some landscape elements used by honeybees, either as foraging habitat or as visual landmark for orientation, may partly determine floral scheme efficiency. We investigated this issue using resource selection functions (RSFs), i.e. models that aim to predict the occurrence of foraging honeybees at floral patches as a function of the presence of keystone landscape elements in their proximity. However, deciding which landscape elements are effectively in the proximity or not is mostly a matter of subjectivity. The novelty of our approach resides in its use of a distance-weighting function to explicitly account for the spatial location of surrounding landscape elements. In that respect, a distance function should be scaled on movement patterns of foraging organisms. Herein, we inferred movement patterns from the autocorrelative properties of honeybee foraging activity. This modeling approach was developed on Phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia) field margin strips, a typical ""honeybee-friendly"" floral scheme. A foraging survey conducted on 170 Phacelia plots (2 m x 2 m) from 17 Phacelia strips, all positioned within the foraging range of an experimental apiary, revealed that (i) the floral scheme efficiency is positively influenced by the presence of linear landscape elements such as hedgerows and forest edges, but negatively affected by the presence of alternative floral resources, and that (ii) weighting the relative importance of those landscape elements by incorporating a distance function into models considerably improved their predictive power. This modeling tool has the potential to help land managers optimizing their financial investment by avoiding low-efficiency landscape areas, or favoring high-efficiency ones, at the time of planning floral enhancement schemes.

The width of the zone where net rainfall was affected by the hedgerows was equivalent to about two hedgerow heights. Rainfall interception was calculated as the difference between the volume of water, from gross rainfall, that would have reached the ground of the sampling area (which also included areas outside the canopy) without the presence of a hedgerow and the actual amount of net rainfall plus stemflow. Averaged over both hedgerows the interception loss during the period of full leaf cover was 57% of PG if related to the ground area covered by the hedgerow canopies or 24% of PG if related to the total ground area affected by the presence of the hedgerows. For the leafless period, the respective values were 49 and 19%. Stemflow constituted a small part in the water balance of the hedgerows and equalled 0.2% of PG in the summer and 0.5% of PG in the winter. Interception storage capacity, if related to projected canopy area, was 2.6 mm during the growing season and 1.2 mm in the leafless hedgerows. During many small rainstorms, which were often associated with high windspeeds, the hedgerows intercepted more rainwater than the amount that would have fallen on the ground covered by them without their presence. This caused the coefficient of free throughfall, when calculated per unit projected canopy area, to be negative. The original Gash [Gash, J.H.C., 1979. An analytical model of rainfall interception by forests. Quart. J. R. Meteorol. Soc. 105, 43-55] analytical model of rainfall interception was parameterised for the hedgerows and tested using data that had not been included in the parameterisation process.

Many studies have shown that arthropods are influenced by landscape context. Therefore, for successful wireworm risk assessment, it is important to gain more information on relationships between landscape structure and wireworm infestation level. The aim of this study was to investigate if different landscape variables are related to wireworm infestation, represented by the proportion of wireworm damaged potato tubers. Based on aerial photographs and field surveys landscape variables, such as landscape composition, landscape complexity and ecological variables were characterised around 14 randomly selected potato field plots alongside the gradient from the lower warm-dry 'Weinviertel' (region 1) to the cool-humid 'Waldviertel' (region 2) in the North-East of Austria at three scales (1, 9 and 25 ha). Relationships between landscape variables and wireworm damage ratings were described by Spearman correlations coefficients. Our results showed that wireworm damage was higher in region 2 than in region 1 and tended to be higher in soils with higher sand content. Among the tested landscape variables only landscape composition, especially grassy field margins were significantly positively correlated with wireworm damage at the 25 ha scale. In areas with high proportion of such grassy habitats, farmers should pay more attention to field characteristics, such as sand content in soil, and management, like crop rotation. Further investigations on appropriate management regimes for grassy landscape elements suppressing wireworm populations but ensuring the maintenance of natural pest control should be conducted.

The population density, phenology, nest-site selection, nest success and helping behaviour of breeding long-tailed tits Aegithalos caudatus was studied in NW Spain during 2002-2007. The fieldwork was conducted in an area of 500 ha between Palacio and Pedrtin (42 degrees 43' 26 '' 42 degrees 46' 15 '' S-N, 5 degrees 29' 58 '' 5 degrees 30' 55 '' E-W, 900-1,000 m a.s.l.), in the Torio river valley, Leon province. Population density was estimated through line transects and mapping. Records of pairs carrying nest material in their bills, building a nest and carrying food in their bills were distributed in 10-day intervals. Nest-site selection was estimated using the Jacobs' index. To determine nest success, only those found in the early stages of building were considered. To establish provisioning rates, each nest with nestlings was observed for a minimum of 3 h. The number of helpers at each nest each day was deduced from the maximum number of different adults feeding nestlings at the same time, subtracting the two individuals that formed the pair. Population density was c. 6-10 birds/10 ha. Winter flock break-up and pair formation usually occurred from the beginning of February, nest building during 11 March-10 April, laying and incubation during 11-30 April, and the presence of nestlings throughout May. Probably few pairs renested after failing to breed. The most typical habitats in the nest surroundings were hedgerows and oak woods. Two thirds of the nests were built in shrubs and the rest in trees. Rubus brambles were highly preferred plant species for supporting nests. Nest success was very low (c. 18%), and nest failure occurred mainly before hatching due to predation. No cases of helping behaviour were recorded prior to the nestling stage. Cooperative breeding was verified in 60% of the nests, and it occurred in all the habitats and vegetation strata. The final number of helpers per nest was between one and four, usually one or two. Values over 40 visits to the nest in one hour were only recorded when there was at least one helper, and over 50 visits with two or more helpers. In conclusion, (i) optimal habitat conditions for the long-tailed tit were found in the study area; (ii) several characteristics of the observed breeding ecology coincided with those well-described in similar habitats in the UK; (iii) the same determining factors for helping behaviour probably occurred in both locations, with great importance of low breeding success. Research is needed on the social organization and breeding system of this species in more areas in its wide distribution range.","2010","2020-10-29 20:11:01","2021-10-19 13:13:38","","267-284","","","57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Red squirrels were mainly arboreal, though they used the ground to some degree throughout the year. The height at which individuals were seen in shrubs/trees was maximum in spring related to intensive use of high poplars. A seasonal variation in plant selection was found. Red squirrels selected oaks, ivy and poplars positively in winter, poplars, ashes and willows in spring, hazels, wild cherries and willows in summer, and hazels, ashes and willows in autumn, linked with shelter, nest-site and food requirements.

Achieving these ecosystem service goals depends, in part, on their ability to remove water from the soil via transpiration. In these systems, edges between crop fields and trees of the buffer systems can create advection processes, which could influence water use by trees. We conducted a field study in a riparian buffer system established in 1994 under a humid temperate climate, located in the Corn Belt region of the Midwestern U.S. (Iowa). The goals were to estimate stand level transpiration by the riparian buffer, quantify the controls on water use by the buffer system, and determine to what extent advective energy and tree position within the buffer system influence individual tree transpiration rates. We primarily focused on the water use response (determined with the Heat Ratio Method) of one of the dominant species (Acer saccharinum) and a subdominant (Juglans nigra). A few individuals of three additional species (Quercus bicolor, Betula nigra, Platanus occidentalis) were monitored over a shorter time period to assess the generality of responses. Meteorological stations were installed along a transect across the riparian buffer to determine the microclimate conditions. The differences found among individuals were attributed to differences in species sap velocities and sapwood depths, location relative to the forest edge and prevailing winds and canopy exposure and dominance. Sapflow rates for A. saccharinum trees growing at the SE edge (prevailing winds) were 39% greater than SE interior trees and 30% and 69% greater than NW interior and edge trees, respectively. No transpiration enhancement due to edge effect was detected in the subdominant J. nigra. The results were interpreted as indicative of advection effects from the surrounding crops. Further, significant differences were document in sapflow rates between the five study species, suggesting that selection of species is important for enhancing specific riparian buffer functions. However, more information is needed on water use patterns among diverse species growing under different climatic and biophysical conditions to assist policy and management decisions regarding effective buffer design.

Reconversion of annual agricultural systems to perennial vegetation can lead to hydrologic function restoration, but its effect is still not well understood. Therefore, our objective was to assess the effects of strategic introduction of different amounts and location of native prairie vegetation (NPV) within agricultural landscapes on hydrological regulation. The study was conducted in Iowa (USA), and consisted of a fully balanced, replicated, incomplete block design whereby 12 zero-order ephemeral flow watersheds received four treatments consisting of varying proportions (0%, 10%, and 20%) of prairie vegetation located in different watershed positions (footslope vs. contour strips). Runoff volume and rate were measured from 2008 to 2010 (April–October) with an H-Flume installed in each catchment, and automated ISCO samplers. Over the entire study period, we observed a total of 129 runoff events with an average runoff volume reduction of 37% based on the three treatments with NPV compared to watersheds with row crops. We observed a progressively greater reduction across the 3years of the study as the perennial strips became established with the greatest differences among treatments occurring in 2010. The differences among the watersheds were attributed mainly to NPV amount and position, with the 10% NPV at footslope treatment having the greatest runoff reduction probably because the portion of NPV filter strip that actually contacted watershed runoff was greater with the 10% NPV at footslope. We observed greater reductions in runoff in spring and fall likely because perennial prairie plants were active and crops were absent or not fully established. High antecedent soil moisture sometimes led to little benefit of the NPV treatments but in general the NPV treatments were effective during both small and large events. We conclude that, small amounts of NPV strategically incorporated into corn-soybean watersheds in the Midwest US can be used to effectively reduce runoff.

The STRIPs (Science-based Trials of Row crops Integrated with Prairies) project is a watershed-scale experiment at the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge, in Jasper County, Iowa, US, in which strips of prairie vegetation were planted within watersheds of corn ( Zea mays ) and soybean (Glycine max ) production to aid in soil and water conservation. The project includes 12 0.5- to 3.2-ha watersheds. Nine watersheds included buffer strips in one of three design treatments that varied the number and position of strips and/or the proportion of the watershed converted to buffer and three watersheds were 100% crop. The present study investigated: (1) If the design of prairie buffer strips influenced their vegetation; (2) If the vegetation of prairie buffer strips shifted over time; (3) If prairie buffer strips caused a weed problem in adjacent crop fields. From 2008-2011, the identity and percent cover of plant species within the buffer strips were surveyed, and from 2009-2011, the identity and percent cover of weed species within the cropped areas of the watersheds were surveyed. Differences among treatments and among years in plant species diversity, percent cover, and composition were analyzed using ANOVA and NMS. The design of buffer strips did not influence plant species diversity or composition; however, buffer strip vegetation did shift over time. In 2008, the strips had 38 species (in 6 m 2 ) with 37% of the total plant cover composed of perennial species and 22% composed of native perennial species. By 2011, the strips had 55 species (in 6 m2 ) with 90% of the total plant cover composed of perennial species and 58% composed of native perennial species. In addition, NMS analyses indicated that the buffer strip plant community shifted from annual to perennial species. Within the crop, weed species richness and percent cover did not differ among watershed treatments, regardless of whether watersheds contained buffer strips or not. Prairie buffer strips greatly increased plant diversity in the watersheds; 380% more species were found in 6 m 2 of prairie buffer than in 6 m2 of cropland.

Restoring small areas of prairie on cropland may increase plant biodiversity and native species abundance while benefiting the cropland. In Iowa, we incorporated buffer strips composed of prairie vegetation within catchments (0.5 ha to 3.2 ha land areas in which precipitation drained to a collection point at the slope bottom) used for corn (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max) production. We planted prairie buffer strips in three designs, varying the proportion of the catchment converted to buffer and/or the continuity of the buffer. Within the catchments, we determined the identity and percent cover of buffer strip plant species during 2008-2011 and of weed species in cropped areas during 2009-2011. We found 380% more species in 6 m² of buffer strip than in 6 m2 of crop, indicating that the presence of buffer strips greatly increased catchment diversity. Plant community composition did not differ among the three buffer designs. Despite being surrounded by cropland, the buffer vegetation was dominated by native perennial species-the targeted vegetation type for both ecohydrological functions (e.g., erosion control) and native species conservation- within four years of establishment. Furthermore, weed species richness and prevalence did not differ between cropped areas of catchments with buffer strips and cropped areas of catchments without buffer strips. These results indicate that converting 10-20% of cropland to prairie buffer strips successfully reintroduced perennial species characteristic of native prairie without increasing weeds in adjacent crops.

'Strike' (white-seeded) and 'Rushmore' (dark-seeded) were planted in locations sheltered from wind stress by tree windbreaks (shelterbelts) and in locations exposed to normal winds using a randomized complete-block design with a split-split plot arrangement of treatments. Air temperature, soil temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction were monitored. Detailed microclimate conditions at bean canopy level in sheltered and exposed plots are provided in the text. Wind speed in sheltered areas averaged 36% of open field wind speed in 1994 and 43% of open wind speed in 1995. Soil temperatures were higher in sheltered areas than in exposed areas. Microclimate changes due to shelter had no effect on the percent seedling emergence or number of days to emergence. Plants in shelter had significantly higher total dry weight and leaf area index and greater total internode length than exposed plants. Both total and marketable yields were increased significantly by production under sheltered conditions each year. Planting date and cultivar also had a significant impact on average pod yields. No interactions between shelter and planting date, or shelter and cultivar, were found in either year. The results suggest that wind protection provided by shelterbelts (tree windbreaks) can increase pod yields of snap bean both early and late in the season. This may result in greater profit for the grower due to a tendency for higher prices at these times.","2004","2020-10-29 20:11:05","2021-10-19 13:14:03","","996-1004","","","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From our findings we can conclude that the presence of grassy field margins in arable landscapes increases the abundance of carabids and earthworms but decreases the abundance of gastropods.

Predatory beetles are amongst the most numerous and diverse arthropods present in arable fields. The primary ecosystem services provided by predatory beetles are in biological control and food chain maintenance as they are a key resource for many higher organisms. However, to be effective biological control agents, able to respond quickly to wherever a pest infestation occurs, then they must be sufficiently abundant and widely distributed. Conservation biocontrol utilising predatory beetles has focussed on the impact of species that overwinter in adjacent field boundaries, although those overwintering within fields are often more abundant. If the abundance and distribution of predatory beetles is to be maximised then further knowledge of their spatial dynamics is required to ensure habitats are arranged appropriately. The spatio-temporal dynamics of boundary and field overwintering species was measured across 64 ha encompassing six fields and for three consecutive years using a grid of 973 pitfall traps. Boundary species were more numerous in spring (May and June) whereas more field species were captured in July. The species composition was comprised of relatively few taxa. Boundary species occurred in small patches that were distributed across the fields in spring, but were only found close to the margins in July. Patches persisted in some locations over two years. Field species occurred in larger patches, spread across particular fields and these were stable within years and to some extent between years. Game-cover strips were attractive to boundary species in the spring and summer and did not effect predator distribution in the adjacent crop.","2009","2020-10-29 20:11:07","2021-10-19 13:13:41","","","","","- 54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4; - 28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In year 1, by 14d after inoculation the aerial natural enemies alone had caused substantial reductions (88%) in numbers of cereal aphids compared to where no natural enemies were present. In contrast, epigeal predators achieved a 31% reduction, although this reached 88% after 28d. In year 2, both aerial and epigeal natural enemies achieved over 87% control after 14d. Aerial natural enemies were largely comprised of predatory Diptera and Linyphiidae (Araneae). Levels of control were positively related to the proportion of linear grass margins within 250, 500 and 750m radii of the study arenas.

The relative abundance of different natural enemy guilds were manipulated to investigate their impact on grain aphids (Sitobion avenae) and whether the establishment of wider field margins increased levels of control. The impact of epigeal and flying aphid predators, in isolation and together, on cereal aphids was tested in five fields with standard field margins (ca. 2m wide) and in five fields with wide margins (ca. 6m wide). Flying predators alone were as effective as all predators in controlling the grain aphid and reduced aphids by 90% and 93%, whereas epigeal predators alone achieved a reduction of only 40% and 18% in fields with standard and wide margins respectively. Levels of parasitism measured by counts of aphid mummies were relatively low (⩽12%) on all sampling occasions. There was no evidence that the wide field margins increased natural enemies within the adjacent field as measured using pitfall traps, suction sampling and sticky traps. The wide field margins were considered to have no benefit for biocontrol because flying predators capable of moving between fields were primarily responsible or the amount of uncropped land suitable for natural enemies was not a limiting factor in the landscape.

The impact of three management treatments (project-, farm-managed and organic farming) alongside habitat type, quantity of uncropped land removed from production and spatial configuration (strips or blocks) on wild bees, butterflies and hoverflies were investigated. Pollinators were assessed on 28 sites over three years, along boundaries representing site scale (ca. 100-ha) and within project-managed (floristically enhanced grass, wild bird seed mix, insect rich cover and natural regeneration) or farm-managed wildlife habitats (typically grass margins or game cover). Project-management resulted in the creation of the most widely utilised habitats (floristically enhanced grass and wild bird seed mixtures), but these may attract wild bees away from boundaries whereas butterfly abundance (Lycaenidae and Pieridae) was enhanced along field boundaries. Organic management and spatial configuration of habitats had little impact. Proportion of uncropped land per site was positively related to Cuckoo bee, Lycaenidae and Satyridae density and butterfly species richness at site scale and on the density of several bee species, total wild bees, Pieridae and total butterflies in wildlife habitats. The mean abundance of uncropped land was 3.6% and at least double this was required to double the abundance of wild bees and butterflies. Wild bee densities were highest in field boundaries and floristically enhanced grass and positively correlated with flower cover. Butterflies sought habitats containing their larval food plants and high flower cover. Hoverflies were most abundant in the insect rich cover. Wildlife habitat in agricultural landscapes may be insufficient and additional, diverse habitats are needed to encourage pollinators. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

An increase in organic cropping in the surrounding landscape from 5% to 20% enhanced bee species richness in fallow strips by 50%, density of solitary bees by 60% and bumble bee density by 150%. Bee species richness and bumble bee density responded strongest to organic cropping in landscape sectors with 500 m radius, solitary bee density in landscape sectors with 250 m radius. The most likely source of these results is that crop and noncrop habitats are strongly connected via bee foraging at the landscape scale. It seems likely that bees depending on nesting sites in fallow strips benefited from the more abundant flower resources provided by broadleaved weeds in organic crop fields.

Non-crop corridors may have the potential to enhance the connectivity for arthropod predators in cropland landscapes, especially for species that require multiple habitats, such as cavity-nesting wasps which use wooded habitat for nesting and grassland habitat for foraging. However, the effects of corridors in nonexperimental landscapes have been rarely examined. We studied the species richness and abundance of cavity-nesting wasps and their parasitoids in standardized trap nests located in three habitat types (forest edge, hedge, grass strip) and in three grass-strip types (connected to a forest edge, slightly isolated, highly isolated from a forest edge). Species richness and the abundance of wasps (Hymenoptera: Sphecidae, Eumenidae, Pompilidae) were highest at forest edges, which provide natural nesting sites, and lowest in grass strips, with few natural nesting sites. Wasp abundance in grass strips connected to forest edges was 270% higher than in slightly isolated grass strips and 600% higher than in highly isolated grass strips. The abundance of caterpillar-hunting eumenid wasps was 600% higher in connected grass strips than in slightly and highly isolated grass strips. Species richness of wasps was enhanced by 180% in connected grass strips compared to highly isolated grass strips. Parasitism rates were not directly influenced by habitat or grass-strip type, but increased with increasing parasitoid diversity that was higher at forest edges than in grass strips. We conclude that grass-strip corridors enhance the colonization of nesting sites, presumably by facilitating wasp movements. In agricultural landscapes, where nesting sites are limited and food availability changes frequently, rapid colonization of nests may enhance population viability. Higher wasp abundance in connected nesting sites may be directly linked to higher biocontrol of pest caterpillars within the foraging range around nests. Although grass strips can reduce the negative effects of habitat fragmentation, non-crop habitats such as forest habitats and hedges providing nesting sites are required within the home range of wasps to allow reproduction in agricultural landscapes.","2009","2020-10-29 20:11:10","2021-10-19 13:14:03","","123-132","","","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Habitat destruction and increasing land use intensity result in habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, and subsequently in the loss of species diversity. The fact that these factors are often highly confounded makes disentangling their effects extremely difficult, if not impossible, and their relative impact on species loss is mostly speculative. 2. In a two-year study, we analysed the relative importance of changed landscape composition (increased areas of cropped habitats), reduced habitat connectivity and reduced habitat quality on nest colonization of cavity-nesting bees, wasps and their parasitoids. We selected 23 pairs of conventional and organic wheat fields in the centre of landscape circles (500 m radius) differing in edge densities (landscape configuration) and % non-crop habitats (landscape composition). Standardized trap nests were established in the field centres and in neighbouring permanent fallow strips (making a total of 92 nesting sites). 3. Factors at all three scales affected nest colonization. While bees were enhanced by high proportions of non-crop habitat in the landscape, wasps profited from high edge densities, supporting our hypothesis that wasps are enhanced by connecting corridors. Colonization of herbivore-predating wasps was lower in field centres than in fallow strips for conventional sites, but not for organic sites, indicating a fallow-like connectivity value of organic fields. The relative importance of habitat type and farming system varied among functional groups suggesting that their perception of crop-non-crop boundaries or the availability of their food resources differed. 4. Local and landscape effects on parasitoids were mainly mediated by their hosts. Parasitism rates were marginally affected by local factors. A specialist parasitoid was more sensitive to high land use intensity than its host, whereas generalist parasitoids were less sensitive. 5. We conclude that the conversion of cropland into non-crop habitat may not be a sufficiently successful strategy to enhance wasps or other species that suffer more from isolation than from habitat loss. Interestingly, habitat connectivity appeared to be enhanced by both higher edge densities and by organic field management. Thus, we conclude that high proportions of conventionally managed and large crop fields threaten pollination and biological control services at a landscape scale.","2010","2020-10-29 20:11:11","2021-10-19 13:14:14","","491-500","","","79","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Non-fertilized strips that were ploughed and either unsown or sown with a grass and meadow herb seed mixture were created in a grass crop field, in order to test the establishment of several meadow herb species, to investigate to what extent creation of sown and unsown strips increased plant species numbers and the number of meadow herbs, and to assess the contribution of species dispersal from an adjacent semi-natural field margin into the created strips. The strips were cut each autumn and plant material removed. Plant species composition was studied in permanent quadrats in the strips and in the surrounding grass crop during four years. Four of the 22 sown meadow herb species did not establish in the strips. Sowing increased both the number of meadow herbs and plant species diversity (calculated by the Shannon index) compared with the grass crop. Creating unsown strips did not increase the number of meadow herbs or plant species diversity. The created strips were colonized by woody species originating from the adjacent semi-natural field margin, but the meadow herbs present in the field margin did not colonize the strips. In the short term, establishment of sown strips would improve biodiversity locally. However, such strips will not serve as suitable habitats for the most vulnerable meadow herbs, and thus creation of new strips cannot compensate for loss of existing species-rich, semi-natural habitats.","2008","2020-10-29 20:11:12","2021-10-19 13:14:32","","208-215","","","58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Field margins within intensively managed ecosystems are often seen as a last refuge for biodiversity, and are typically targeted with measures within many agri-environment schemes. Grassland accounts for 81 million ha of land within the EU; however, the ecology of field margins associated with permanent grassland has not been well studied. 2. This study investigated the effects of experimental field margin measures on hymenopteran parasitoid communities over a 5-year period. Hymenopteran parasitoids were chosen because they occupy high trophic levels, feed on a diverse range of plant and invertebrate hosts, and are considered good indicators of arthropod diversity. Establishment methods included: fencing, natural regeneration, and reseeding with a wildflower mixture, at three margin widths. 3. Field margin establishment method had a significant effect on abundance of parasitoids. Establishment method did not have a significant effect on parasitoid genera diversity, but did affect parasitoid community composition. Margin width had no significant impact on parasitoid communities. 4. Grazing had a significant negative effect on parasitoid genus richness and community structure. This suggests that structural diversity of vegetation plays an important role in parasitoid community structure. 5. Plant species richness did not significantly affect parasitoid abundance or genera richness. Noxious species within plots resulted in a significantly greater abundance and diversity of parasitoids and of idiobionts in particular. 6. Where plant species richness is limited, simple measures such as fencing of narrow field margins may be as effective at increasing parasitoid taxon richness and abundance (indicators of arthropod richness and abundance) as expensive measures such as reseeding and wider margin widths.","2014","2020-10-29 20:11:13","2021-10-19 13:13:59","","289-307","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rationale for the study was that replicated buffer plot studies had shown that vegetated buffers will effectively assimilate N, but it was not known whether or not they would work at a larger scale. The study was conducted on a commercial farm near Tifton, Georgia. Wastewater was pumped from a single-stage anaerobic lagoon to vegetated buffers composed of grass and mature or newly planted pines. The buffers approximated 60 m in length by 90 m in width. The upper 10 m of each buffer was in grass, while the downslope area was in mature or newly planted pines. Six buffers were instrumented for wastewater application and water quality monitoring. Two buffers received wastewater at a 1X rate (600 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), two at a 3/4X rate (450 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), and two served as controls. The wastewater was applied to the 10 m grassed portion of the buffers. Transects of shallow groundwater wells starting at the grass-forest interface and running downslope were used to monitor water quality N. The study showed mixed results concerning N assimilation by the buffers. Upslope land use changes by the producer during the study added significant N inputs to one set of buffers, and they were unable to assimilate sufficient N from both these inputs and the wastewater to protect shallow groundwater quality. In contrast, almost all samplings of shallow groundwater under the buffers receiving N only from the overland flow applied swine lagoon effluent showed nitrate (NO3-N) concentrations 20 and 30 m downslope to be lower than 10 mg L-1 (drinking water standard). On these buffers, NO3-N concentrations in shallow groundwater were near background levels five years after wastewater application commenced. The study indicated that the ratio of buffer area width to wastewater application area width on the landscape should be at least 1:1, and that buffers for protection of water quality should be continuous oil the landscape. It was concluded from the study that buffers call be used at the farm scale to assimilate N from applied wastewater when they are sufficiently wide relative to waste application area, rate, and other N sources at the farm scale.","2007","2020-10-29 20:11:14","2021-10-19 13:13:35","","53-64","","","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Permanent vegetation strips on cultivated slopes could be an effective soil conservation technique to reduce erosion. Previous studies showed that cultivated Mahonia aquifolium can be an effective plant for water erosion control. However, no detailed studies have been carried out to evaluate the efficiency of M. aquifolium as a permanent vegetation strip. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of M. aquifolium strips on soil erosion control under various bio-physical conditions with the use of the Revised Morgan-Morgan-Finney model (RMMF). The RMMF model was first calibrated by using measured quantities of surface runoff and validated against soil loss data from M. aquifolium plots. After calibration the model showed erosion to be transport limited process for all M. aquifolium plots and a detachment limited for the bare soil control plot. The model was then used to predict surface runoff and soil loss for various soil types, slope angles and cultivations with and without M. aquifolium strips. The study indicated that the presence of M. aquifolium strips substantially reduced the soil loss rate on all studied crop fields. For steeper slopes with M. aquifolium strips the model predicted a lower soil loss rate than for gentle slopes without strips.

Total nitrogen and organic carbon increased with age of plantation. The overall ground flora consisted of 182 species, but many occured in only a few plantations. The majority of species were competitors and ruderals. The total number of species, and the number of grassland and woodland species, increased with plantation area. Only arable weed species number was related to plantation age (negatively). Canopy closure markedly reduced the number of species in plantations. The presence of good quality hedgerows adjacent to plantations increased their species richness, especially of shade-tolerant herbs. Planted tree survival in individual plantations ranged from 32 to 98% but was generally good (mean 76%). Most losses occured in the first 9 years and were associated with competition with grasses or with adjacent hedgerows. The density of naturally sown seedlings ranged from 0 to 5667 (mean 360) ha-1.

Few studies of riparian or treatment wetland denitrification consider the production of nitrous oxide (N2O). The objectives of this research were to ascertain the level of potential N2O production in riparian buffers and identify controlling factors for N2O accumulations within riparian soils of an agricultural watershed in the southeastern Coastal Plain of the USA. Soil samples were obtained from ten sites (site types) with different agronomic management and landscape position. Denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) was measured by the acetylene inhibition method. Nitrous oxide accumulations were measured after incubation with and without acetylene (baseline N2O production). The mean DEA (with acetylene) was 59 microg N2O-N kg(-1) soil h(-1) for all soil samples from the watershed. If no acetylene was added to block conversion of N2O to N2, only 15 microg N2O-N kg(-1) soil h(-1) were accumulated. Half of the samples accumulated no N2O. The highest level of denitrification was found in the soil surface layers and in buffers impacted by either livestock waste or nitrogen from legume production. Nitrous oxide accumulations (with acetylene inhibition) were correlated to soil nitrogen (r2=0.59). Without acetylene inhibition, correlations with soil and site characteristics were lower. Nitrous oxide accumulations were found to be essentially zero, if the soil C/N ratios>25. Soil C/N ratios may be an easily measured and widely applicable parameter for identification of potential hot spots of N2O productions from riparian buffers.","2007","2020-10-29 20:11:15","2021-10-19 13:14:29","","1368-76","","","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objectives of this experiment were to (i) assess denitrification activity within a riparian zone and (ii) determine the influence of physical, chemical, and landscape features on denitrification. This experiment was conducted from 1994 to 1997 in North Carolina on a riparian zone contiguous to a spray field that was heavily loaded with swine lagoon wastewater. Denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) was measured on soils collected from (i) the soil surface, (ii) midway between the soil surface and water table, and (iii) above the water table. The DEA ranged from 3 to 1660 mug N2O-N kg(-1) soil h(-1). The DEA was highest next to the stream and lowest next to the spray field. Nitrate was found to be the limiting factor for denitrification. The DEA generally decreased with soil depth; means for the surface, middle, and bottom depths were 147,83, and 67 mug N2O-N kg(-1)soil h(-1), respectively. These DEA values are higher than those reported for riparian zones adjoining cropland of the southeastern United States, but are lower than those reported for a constructed wetland used for treatment of swine wastewater. Regression analysis indicated that soil total nitrogen was the highest single factor correlated to DEA (r(2) = 0.65). The inclusion of water table depth, soil depth, and distance from the spray field improved the R-2 to 0.86. This riparian zone possessed sufficient soil area with high denitrifying conditions to be a significant factor in the removal of excess nitrogen in the ground water.","2004","2020-10-29 20:11:16","2021-10-19 13:13:43","","2367-2374","","","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effects of two pesticide regimes (conventional and reduced) on spiders were contrasted with effects of two types of cultivation systems (customary and integrated farming practice). The plots under the conventional pesticide regime were sprayed with herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and growth regulators annually. The plots on reduced pesticide regime were treated only when the control thresholds were exceeded (in 1992 with insecticide and in 1994 with herbicide). The perennial grass strips (sown with a mixture of timothy, meadow fescue, red clover and white clover) at the margins of the treated plots provided an additional element. Seasonal patterns of spider catches were quite synchronous in the field and in the perennial strip. Number of spiders were clearly higher in perennial strips than in the field. Furthermore, the composition of spider fauna differed between cerela plots and perennial grass strips. Lycosidae dominated in grass strips, whereas in cereal fields the family Linyphiidae was common. The dominance of Lycosidae in grass strips increased from year to year. The perennial strips affected the spider abundance of the field; total spider catches and Lycosidae catches, but not Linyphiidae, in pitfalls near the strips were higher than in pitfalls situated further away. However, the effects of pesticide treatments on spider numbers did not depend on the distance from the perennial strip. Reduced pesticide use plots had greater total spider catches than conventional plots in 1992 and 1994. In both years the difference was obvious for more than 3 weeks after insecticide (dimethoate) treatment. In 1992, pirimicarb was nearly harmless to spiders compared to dimethoate. In 1994, the dimethoate treatment (in June) did not decrease clearly the abundance of spiders, but deltamethrin treatment (in July) had dramatic effects on the total spider abundance and the difference was still obvious in the last sampling period. At family level, the effects of pesticide treatments varied between families. Statistically significant differences between pesticide treatments were found in all years in Linyphiidae numbers, but in Lycosidae only in 1994. During the period of 3 years, no differences were found in the numbers of spiders between the two cultivation systems tested.

However, how these margins can affect the movement of species and individuals (i.e. spillover) of natural enemies between field margins and crop is still unclear. In this work, we investigated the spillover of two different groups of natural enemies: tachinids (Diptera: Tachinidae) and aphidophagous hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae). For comparison we also investigated the response of non-aphidophagous hoverflies. We examined the spillover from two types of field margin (grass margin vs. hedgerow + grass margin) to adjacent maize fields located in landscapes with different proportion of arable land. The spillover of natural enemies was affected by the field margins, but the response varied between insect groups. The spillover of tachinids was higher from the grass margin than from hedgerows, suggesting that the spillover of this group may be related to the low contrast between the vegetation structure of the margin and the crop. In contrast to tachinids, the abundance of aphidophagous hoverflies was higher toward the center of the crop field, independently of the type of field margin. The spillover of non-aphidophagous hoverflies was not affected by the type of field margin. These species were only affected by the landscape composition as their species richness and abundance were higher in landscapes with low amounts of arable land. Measures focusing on the creation and management of field margins need to consider the local contrast between field margins and crops in relation to the life-history traits of different taxa. Es wurde vorgeschlagen, dass Einrichtung und Schutz von Feldrändern dem Rückgang der Biodiversität in der Agrarlandschaft entgegenwirken sollten, aber wie diese Ränder die Bewegung von Arten und Individuen von natürlichen Feinden zwischen Feldrändern und Feldfläche (sog. ""spillover"") beeinflussen ist immer noch unklar. Wir untersuchten den spillover von zwei unterschiedlichen Gruppen von natürlichen Feinden: Raupenfliegen (Diptera: Tachinidae) und aphidivore Schwebfliegen (Diptera: Syrphidae). Zum Vergleich betrachteten wir auch die nicht-aphidivoren Schwebfliegen. Wir untersuchten den spillover zwischen zwei Arten von Feldrändern (Grasrand und Hecke mit Grasrand) und den angrenzenden Maisfeldern, die in Landschaften mit unterschiedlichen Anteilen von Ackerflächen lagen. Der spillover der natürlichen Feinde wurde vom Feldrandtyp beeinflusst, aber die beiden Gruppen reagierten unterschiedlich. Der spillover der Raupenfliegen war vom Grasrand größer als von der Hecke, was nahelegt, dass der spillover bei dieser Gruppe eher mit dem geringen Kontrast zwischen der Vegetationsstruktur von Rand und Feldfrucht zusammenhängt. Dagegen war die Abundanz der aphidivoren Schwebfliegen zur Feldmitte hin erhöht, unabhängig vom Typ des Feldrands. Der spillover der nicht-aphidivoren Schwebfliegen wurde nicht durch den Typ des Feldrandes beeinflusst. Wir fanden nur einen Einfluss der Landschaft, da ihr Artenreichtum und ihre Abundanz in Landschaften mit geringem Ackerflächenanteil höher waren. Maßnahmen zur Schaffung und Pflege von Feldrändern müssen den lokalen Unterschied zwischen Feldrändern und Feldfrüchten in Bezug auf die Biologie der verschiedenen Taxa berücksichtigen. © 2015 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","2015","2020-10-29 20:11:18","2021-10-19 13:14:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although PFSs are similar to riparian buffers, the processes responsible for NO3--N removal from PFSs are not well understood. Our objectives were to (i) determine the importance of denitrification as a sink for NO3--N loss from PFSs and (ii) evaluate how PFSs alter the biophysical processes that affect the relative importance of N2O and N-2 emissions. To address our objectives, we used a coupled field laboratory approach with experimental watersheds that included the following treatments: (i) PFSs covering the bottom 10% of the watershed and an annual corn-soybean crop rotation covering the remaining upslope 90% (PFS); (ii) 100% corn-soybean rotation (CORN); and (iii) 19-yr-old 100% restored native grassland (RNG). In situ N2O flux rates and laboratory N2O/(N-2 + N2O) ratios were highest in CORN watersheds followed by PFS and RNG watersheds. In contrast, potentially mineralizable C and denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) were highest in PFS and RNG watersheds and lowest in CORN watersheds. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between N2O/(N-2 + N2O) ratio and DEA. In the laboratory, N-2 fluxes were highest in PFS followed by RNG and CORN. These results indicate that PFS watersheds support greater total denitrification while emitting less N2O than croplands. Greater potentially mineralizable C in PFS and RNG suggest C availability is an important factor affecting more complete denitrification. These results suggest PFSs function similar to riparian buffers and have potential to reduce NO3--N losses from annual croplands by denitrification to N-2.","2015","2020-10-29 20:11:19","2020-10-29 20:11:19","","239-250","","","79","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At 4 m from the shelterbelt productivity was maximum for both forage crops and corresponded to the highest amount of N originating from caragana. The amount of N transferred from caragana decreased linearly with distance away from the shelterbelt, but even at 20 m from the shelterbelt row measureable amounts of N originating from caragana were detectable in the forage biomass. At 4 m from the shelterbelt approximately 40% of the N in both oat and triticale was from caragana, and at 20 m from the shelterbelt approximately 20% of the N in oat and 8% of the N in triticale was from caragana. © 2015 by the authors.","2015","2020-10-29 20:11:20","2021-10-19 13:14:30","","1922-1932","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Plant diversity and soil disturbance may influence these interactions. We investigated the effects of maize and flower strip habitats on microarthropod abundance and community composition in soil surrounding greater wax moth larvae, Galleria mellonella, infected with the EPN Steinernema carpocapsae (Sc). In the first year of the experiment (2005), we compared microarthropod communities responding to burial of Sc-killed insects with a control (no soil disturbance). In 2006, we added two control treatments: burial of freezer-killed insects and sham burial. Soil samples (including G. mellonella) were collected 2 and 20 clays (2005) or 2 and 12 clays (2006) after application. In 2005, arthropod abundance and community composition were similar between maize and flower strip habitats. In 2006, we detected more arthropods in the maize than the flower strips. In both years, community composition differed between treatments providing resources (Sc-killed and freezer-killed insects) and those without (sham burial and no disturbance), with the greatest difference on the final sampling date. Soil surrounding Sc-killed and freezer-killed insects contained more dipterans, acarid mites, staphylinid beetles, onychiurid and entomobryid collembolans, and immature and male mesostigmatid mites than soil at sham burial and no disturbance sites. Most of these taxa are capable of nematophagy: however. EPN relative abundance was not associated with arthropod community composition. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

In order to assess the retention of eroded C in these settings, SOC stock was measured in grass buffers receiving runoff from cropped watersheds under long-term (>20 y): chisel-till (CT) corn (Zea mays, L.)-soybean [Glycine max, (L.) Merr.] rotation, moldboard plowing (MP) continuous corn (CC), and no-till (NT) CC. Adjacent reference grasslands not affected by erosion were also sampled. In the CC watersheds, the δ13C of bulk soil and soil separates was determined to identify the source of SOC in the grass filters. After accounting for differences in the number of corn crops, SOC stock in the MP watershed showed a corn-C deficit of 9.3 Mg C ha−1 compared to NT. Corn-C accounted for 2 to 16% (mean: 5.2 Mg C ha−1) of the total SOC pool in the grass filter and, assuming water erosion as the main determinant of C distribution, this corn-C gain translates into the retention of 55% of eroded C in the grass strip. Relative to the reference grasslands, SOC stock in the grass filters was up to 30 Mg C ha−1 higher, an amount deemed too large to be attributed solely to retention of eroded C (export rate: 0.05-0.08 Mg C ha−1 y−1). Periodic delivery of nutrients may have enhanced biomass production and indirectly contributed to the observed SOC accrual in grass filters. Higher extractable P and higher C:N ratios at these locations support that hypothesis. These results demonstrate the applicability of 13C isotope to trace SOC sources in buffers receiving runoff from areas supporting C4 vegetation. They also underscore the need to incorporate in-situ biomass production and burial processes in assessing the temporal evolution of SOC stocks in terrestrial deposits and the contribution of these landscape segments to watershed C budget.

This study compared soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes in adjacent crop fields and riparian buffers (a flood-prone forest and a flood-protected grassland along an incised channel) and examined the impact of water table depth (WTD) and flood events on the variability of gas fluxes in riparian zones. Results showed significantly (P < 0.001) higher CO2 emission in riparian areas than in adjoining croplands (6.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.5 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1); mean +/- SE). Daily flux of CO2 and soil temperature were significantly related (P < 0.002), with Q 10 values ranging between 1.75 and 2.53. Significant relationships (P < 0.05) were found between CH4 daily flux and WTD. Flood events resulted in enhanced CH4 emission (up to + 44.5 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) in a swale) under warm soil conditions (> 22 degrees C), but the effect of flooding was less pronounced in early spring (emission < 1.06 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1)), probably due to low soil temperature. Although CH4 flux direction alternated at all sites, overall the croplands and the flood-affected riparian forest were CH4 sources, with annual emission averaging + 0.04 +/- 0.17 and + 0.92 +/- 1.6 kg CH4-C ha(-1), respectively. In the riparian forest, a topographic depression (< 8% of the total area) accounted for 78% of the annual CH4 emission, underscoring the significance of landscape heterogeneity on CH4 dynamics in riparian buffers. The nonflooded riparian grassland, however, was a net CH4 sink (-1.08 +/- 0.22 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1)), probably due to the presence of subsurface tile drains and a dredged/incised channel at that study site. Although these hydrological alterations may have contributed to improvement in the CH4 sink strength of the riparian grassland, this must be weighed against the water quality maintenance functions and other ecological services provided by riparian buffers.","2015","2020-10-29 20:11:22","2021-10-19 13:14:45","","1080-1090","","","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to their small size and low habitat quality, long-term population survival cannot be ascertained and often active management is needed to maintain viable populations of species forced to survive in these small landscape elements. Population models are needed to assess the threats to species at risk and to evaluate alternative management actions. Here, we present a methodology to evaluate management interventions using spatio-temporal analyses of point patterns. We apply this method to several populations of primrose Primula vulgaris in Flanders, where it is rare and predominantly occurs along ditch banks. The effects of ditch bank clearing on the establishment success of seedlings was investigated by comparing spatial patterns of seedling recruitment, survival and mortality between populations that were grazed and populations that were severely disturbed by mechanical clearing of ditch banks followed by annual mowing. A total of 884 seedlings were mapped and monitored during 4 consecutive years (1999-2002). In all populations, plants showed significant clustering, but in cleared sites only seedlings were significantly clustered around adults. Spatial patterns of mortality varied according to the management intervention. In grazed sites, mortality was almost random, whereas in cleared sites we found clear evidence for strong negative density-dependent mortality. There was no evidence that the presence of adults affected survival of recruits in any of the sites studied. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that the analysis of spatial point patterns contributes to our understanding of the population dynamics of plant species occurring in different environments. The approach can be broadly applied to other plant species to elucidate the processes that determine the number of individuals that establish and persist into later life stages and will help conservation managers to refine management strategies intended to conserve or restore plant populations. In the case of P. vulgaris, increasing the availability of microsites is most likely to result in increased growth rates, as it results in increased recruitment and establishment of recruits. © 2010 The Authors.

The wild relatives of crop plants are an important source of genetic variation and can be used to introduce new traits into existing crops. Identification and conservation of crop wild relatives (CWR) is, therefore, an important step to safeguard future food security. Recent efforts have identified geographical hotspots of CWR diversity in several countries but, as yet, there have been no surveys to identify the habitats and landscape features within these areas that might be most suitable for conservation efforts. Here, we use a UK-wide vegetation survey covering a range of both habitats and landscape features (e.g. fields, hedgerows, waterways and roadsides) to identify the habitats and features with the highest proportion of CWR identified as priority taxa for conservation. Priority CWR were most abundant in grassland habitats, although this was most striking in CWR related to forage and fodder crops. CWR related to food crops were most common in cropped and weedy areas, fertile grassland and lowland woodland. Within habitats, CWR occurrence was significantly associated with linear features including hedgerows, roadsides, field boundaries and field margins. Our findings indicate that CWR of conservation interest are often associated with disturbed habitats and landscape features that are not considered as priorities under site-based conservation measures. We suggest that efforts to maintain linear features in hotspots of CWR diversity would be most effective at conserving the UK's CWR resource.

In humid regions, effluent is also applied to fields in order to manage the lagoon stage within acceptable levels. To minimize the risk of applied nutrients being transported to surface waters, best management practices such as vegetative buffers and controlled drainage are often recommended. This paper presents the results of a field study to evaluate the effectiveness of controlled drainage and vegetative buffers in reducing the transport of wastewater nutrients from land application fields. Swine lagoon effluent was spray irrigated to Bermudagrass fields drained by a parallel ditch system. Drainage outflow was monitored continuously for a 3 year period. Vegetative buffers reduced the average concentration of phosphorus by about 30%, but the average concentration of nitrogen was not affected. Controlled drainage resulted in higher individual event nitrogen concentrations, which were due primarily to irrigation onto fields at times when they were too wet to be effectively irrigated. In most cases, the concentration of total N in drainage was comparable to the values observed from other agricultural fields receiving inorganic fertilizer. However, the nitrogen was mainly in the ammonium form rather than nitrate, which could pose greater environmental risk to some fish and other aquatic species in surface waters. The peak concentrations were higher for the controlled drainage treatments than for conventional drainage. The loss of nitrogen in drainage water accounted for roughly 10% of the amount applied (8% on the conventional drainage treatments and 11% on the controlled drainage treatments). On two plots (one controlled, one conventional), more than 40% of the total N transport over the 3 year study period was associated with one extended flow event when wastewater was applied several times while the water table was near the surface. These poorly scheduled irrigations onto already wet fields resulted in as much N and P transport in one event as occurred during the remainder of the study when irrigation was properly scheduled onto dry fields. These observations suggest that irrigation scheduling and proper management were more important to water quality than remedial actions such as controlled drainage or vegetative buffers.

The importance of herbaceous, shrubby and wooded riparian habitats for the conservation of biodiversity (plants, amphibians, reptiles, birds, small mammals) is well documented for the Boyer River watershed (southern Quebec, Canada). This paper examines their conservation value for these different taxonomic groups at the watershed level and the possible effects on wildlife of various landscape modification scenarios. The overall species richness and insectivorous bird abundance in the watershed would increase markedly if there were more wooded strips in the landscape mainly due to additional plant and bird species. A scenario where all three types of riparian strips would be well-represented in the watershed is most likely to be implemented. This scenario would be the most beneficial to wildlife communities because of high native species diversity within wooded strips combined with the presence of unique species associated with each of the three types of strips. Encouraging landowners to protect existing wooded riparian habitats would be the most effective and cost-beneficial method to maintain current level of habitats distribution in the landscape, and to favour the establishment of new shrubby and wooded strips in the Boyer River watershed.

Three types of field margins were distinguished: (a) natural hedgerows (n = 27) with well developed tree and shrub strata, (b) planted windbreaks (n = 17) mostly composed of coniferous trees and generally devoid of a well structured shrub stratum, and (c) herbaceous field margins (n = 17) with isolated shrubs.

Bird use of hedgerows and windbreaks was similar, herbaceous field margins having fewer bird species and individuals than the other two types of field margin. Field margins did not contribute significantly as breeding habitats of bird species that may damage crops, but offered shelter to a broad range of species potentially useful for biological pest control. Bird use of field margins was mostly related to hedges' structural complexity and dimension.

This study explored whether native plant hedgerows have a positive effect on pollinator presence. Bees were collected from six organically managed farms in Central California, four of which had hedgerows and two that did not. On hedgerow sites, bees were sampled at varying distances out from the hedgerows. Native bee abundance and diversity were markedly greater on hedgerow sites.

Grants for wildlife enhancement in the British Isles have supported the widespread planting of new hedges along field margins. However, much of the planted material, particularly of hawthorn Crataegus monogyna, has been obtained from the continental mainland of Europe. There is a need to assess the implications of this practice for hedge-row performance and for the conservation of indigenous genetic variation. 2. One local ecotype and eight commercial provenances (four British and four continental European) of hawthorn were planted in an experimental hedge at both an exposed upland site and a sheltered lowland site. Sections of hedge were planted with or without fencing and with or without mulching in all combinations. Growth and thorniness were assessed over 3 years, and phenology and disease over 2 years. 3. At both sites, the most locally obtained provenance had the latest bud-burst, exhibited the least severe symptoms of mildew and was the most thorny. It also showed the greatest height increment at the upland site, but was relatively slow-growing at the lowland site. 4. An imported Hungarian provenance had early bud-burst, showed a high growth rate and suffered the most severe mildew. A commercially obtained British native provenance was aberrant in its extremely early bud-burst and other attributes comparable with the Hungarian provenance, indicating the possibility of misidentification at some stage of production or supply. 5. In the absence of fencing, at the upland site hawthorn mortality was 100% compared with only 3% at the lowland site. In fenced plots there was c. 320% greater growth when mulching was used. 6. The results suggest that for greater establishment success and hence cost benefits in hedge planting, as well as for greater environmental benefits, there should be closer matching of hawthorn provenance to the planting site. The use of commercial material has demonstrated that locally provenanced material can be superior to any commercially available material, and that the current state of the commercial sector is insufficient to enforce the necessary controls over provenance of material used for hedge renovation.","2001","2020-10-29 20:11:27","2020-10-29 20:11:27","","952-962","","","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Organic fertilizer, in the form of farm-yard manure and rain-diluted liquid slurry which only slowly release nitrogen for plant uptake, might prove less damaging. A 5-year experiment on two contrasting sheep grazed, species-rich grassland field margin sites adjoining a mature hedgerow in mid-Wales compared three levels of fertilizer N (0, 100 and 300 kg N ha-1 year-1) with farm yard manure (FYM) and rain-diluted slurry containing an average annual equivalent of 30-42 kg N ha-1 and 27-72 kg N ha-1 respectively. The aim was 10 assess the impact of treatments on the plant communities of the hedge bottom and field margin strip ecosystems, and to establish whether the species diversity contained within the strips could be encouraged without significantly undermining the quantity and quality of the herbage. By the end of the experiment, the forb component of both ecosystems had been drastically reduced by the high N treatment, to less than half of their original level. The organic treatments on the other hand, particularly FYM showed signs of developing species-rich communities, while at the same time providing a relatively high yielding and nutrient-rich field margin sward of high mineral content. The implications of FYM deposition, particularly in terms of nature conservation considerations are highlighted.","1997","2020-10-29 20:11:28","2021-10-19 13:14:05","","107-123","","","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Working on selected conventional and organic farms in North-central Florida my study objectives were to (1) assess habitat characteristics on and adjacent to farms influencing avian species diversity and insect-foraging activity, and to identify 'functional insectivores' on these farms; (2) determine the effectiveness of sunflower intercrops as refugia for, both, insectivorous birds and beneficial insects in cropped fields, and as tools to enhance insect-foraging by birds in cropped areas; (3) test the hypothesis that insectivorous birds can potentially augment pest control programs involving hymenopteran parasitoid predators, via active preferences for unparasitized over parasitized prey. Using a combination of bird surveys and focal foraging observations over two years, I determined that bird diversity in cropped and non-cropped habitats on farms varied in the following ways; (a) vegetation type in field borders significantly influenced species richness per census point (F 5,30 = 3.5, P = 0.013) and in field borders (F5,30 = 3.8, P = 0.009); (b) mixed crops generated significantly greater bird densities per point (F1,30 = 7.4, P = 0.011) and in cropped fields (F1,30 = 8.2, P = 0.008) and (c) foraging activity and abundance of functional insectivores were greatest in mixed crops (F1,29 = 4.2, P = 0.051). In a replicated, controlled field experiment I determined that intercropping rows of sunflowers significantly increased densities of birds (F = 43.33, p < 0.001), attracted greater numbers (F = 57.51, p < 0.001), and increased foraging time by individual insectivores in crops (F = 50.18, p < 0.001). Visual observations and stomach samples confirmed that birds consumed economically important pest insects. In feeding trials blackbirds exhibited no preference between parasitized and nonparasitized lepidopteran larvae of similar body size (Z = -7.44, p = 0.46) but a significant preference for larger non-parasitized prey (Z = -3.93, p < 0.001). My study suggests that managing farmland habitat can enhance wild bird populations and the potential that they can augment pest control programs in modern agricultural operations.","2003","2020-10-29 20:11:29","2020-10-29 20:11:29","","","143-143 p.","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","","","","","Ecology; 0285:Agronomy; Agronomy; Biological sciences; 0329:Ecology; Forestry; Conservation; Farming; eppi-reviewer4; 0478:Forestry; Avian; Insect pests","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both experiment stations were intensively managed for agricultural row crop and dairy production with field edges managed with frequent mowing and herbicide application. Habitat reclamation and management on 41 ha of field edges was initiated on each farm in 1988 and included selective spraying herbicides to control agronomic grasses, cessation of annual mowing, protection from livestock access, and planting legumes and shrubs. We surveyed birds from 1 May through 15 June on permanently established, fixed-width transects in three conservation buffer and three mowed field edges adjacent to row crops on each experimental farm from 1989 through 2001. We detected 25 bird species on mowed field edges and 51 species on edges maintained in conservation buffers on both farms. Mean species richness and bird abundance were higher (P < 0.05) on conservation buffers than on mowed field edges on both farms. We attributed higher bird species richness and abundance in conservation buffers to a more diverse habitat structure and increased food plant availability created by native plant succession and shrub plantings. These results support the concept that creation and maintenance of conservation buffers in field edges along row crops can increase bird species richness and abundance on agricultural lands.","2006","2020-10-29 20:11:30","2021-10-19 13:13:39","","8-14","","","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The theory of island biogeography, and in particular the equilibrium model, is often invoked to explain the characteristics of communities inhabiting habitat patches. The particularly interesting feature about hedgerows is that they are both a linear, and often an interconnecting patch-type. Landscape ecology addresses the spatial and temporal relationship between patch and matrix habitats and may, therefore, contribute to an understanding of species distributions in hedgerows. Hedgerows on arable land in North Yorkshire and Oxfordshire were studied to assess which factors influence community characteristics and to determine the relevance of island biogeographic and landscape ecological concepts. Three contrasting wildlife groups were studied. First, a plant study addressed the extent to which habitat area can be used to predict species richness. Only in Oxfordshire did a significant species-area effect exist. Hedgerow isolation was also investigated by using indices of connectivity and with the formulation of a hedgerow accessibility index that attempted to measure the degree of physical connectance of a hedge to the surrounding hedgerow network. These indices were only of minor interpretive value and both their conceptual limitations and the difference between functional and physical habitat connectance is recognised. Second, a small mammal study investigated the habitat preference of species and the movements of individuals in and around hedgerows that were either isolated or well connected to others. Species-specific patterns in field/hedgerow preference and movement behaviour were observed. There appeared to be no reliance on hedgerow connections for inter-hedge movement although the presence of nearby roads and verges may have modified movement patterns. Third, a study of millipedes and woodlice addressed both the effect of hedgerow connections and the influence of soil properties on species distributions. Soil pH appeared to be a major determinant of community composition. Hedgerow configuration history and the possibility of `relic' communities are discussed. It is considered that the role of hedgerows as habitats and corridors will depend upon the autecology of the species considered, the quality of the hedgerow habitat and the nature of both the adjacent fields and their surrounding hedgerow network. Island biogeographic concepts are unable to model adequately community characteristics in hedgerows both because of their often narrow and interconnecting nature and because of the temporarily variable land matrix in which they are set. Landscape ecology and metapopulation dynamics may be more profitable conceptual frameworks within which to address the community characteristics of hedgerows.","1992","2020-10-29 20:11:30","2020-10-29 20:11:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One potential method of mitigating these effects is creating flower strips. Most previous studies have shown higher pollinator abundances in flower strips, but none have been able to demonstrate increased pollinator abundances at larger spatial scales, in the surrounding agricultural landscapes. We assessed local and landscape-wide effects of flower strips on pollinator abundances, using 18 carefully selected study landscapes in southern Sweden, distributed along independent gradients of landscape heterogeneity and farming intensity. We found that flower strips were more attractive than field borders in general to bumblebees, whereas hoverflies were only attracted to flower strips from nearby field borders. Solitary bees declined with increasing distance from flower strips, but only in complex landscapes. As one of the first studies investigating effects of flower strips on pollinators across the wider landscape, we found increased abundance of bumblebees, but not solitary bees, in field borders outside the flower strips in floristically enhanced landscapes as compared with control landscapes. However, we found that higher quality and/or larger total area of flower strips within a farm was important for both bumblebees and solitary bees. Hoverfly abundance was enhanced on farms with flower strips in simple landscapes. Our results demonstrate that flower strips with rewarding plants do not only attract pollinators locally, but in addition have the potential to increase pollinator abundances across entire landscapes, and particularly in landscapes dominated by farmland.

The objective of the study was to determine whether the planting of forested strips (shelterbelts) in agricultural area enhances the biomass of spiders active on soil surface of cereal fields and if the exchange of individuals between these habitats depends on the age of trees. The investigations were carried on in 2000 and repeated in 2003/2004 along transects across young shelterbelts (2-11 years old) - ecotones - fields. In the second period the 150 years old forest strip was included into the study. So altogether in both periods the study was performed in the strip-managed area in forested strips 2, 6, 7, 11, and 150 years old, adjacent cereal fields and in the control field located in a deforested area. The intensity of patrolling (number of individuals captured per trap per day) the soil surface by spiders was investigated using pitfall traps forming lines parallel to the shelterbelt. The results of both investigation periods show, that forested strips increased the biomass of patrolling spiders (BP - biomass of spiders per trap per day) in the fields. It was higher in the fields located in the strip-managed area than in the deforested area by ca 70%. The BP decreased gradually with the increasing distance from the strips. Differences between the strip and the field at a distance of 50m were significant (two-way ANOVA, post hoc Tukey test). The reason for the higher BP in the fields adjacent to forested strips was mainly the dispersal of larger spiders from strips to adjacent fields. Dispersal is high between the very young strip and the field and low between the oldest strip and the field. The group of forest-inhabiting species accounted for 0.3-0.5% of the total number of spiders in the field located in deforested area. In the fields adjacent to young shelterbelts this proportion increases with the strips age from 1 to 6%. But in the field bordering the oldest forest strip it is low again and accounted for 1.4%. In this field the proportion of agrobionts is almost as high (94%) as in the field located in deforested area (98%). Similarly the species diversity was very low there. The mean individual body mass of spiders from all the fields located in the strip-managed area was 2.7 times higher than in the control field (P <0.001). It can be concluded, that in the old forest strips the number of specific species, which don't disperse to surroundings, increases. This conclusion may be important for, landscape management.","2007","2020-10-29 20:11:34","2021-10-19 13:13:49","","691-704","","","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the shelterbelt - managed areas the biomass of patrolling (BP) arthropods (ground beetles and spiders) was lower inside the fields (F10, F50) than at the field margins and in the shelterbelts. The BP and individual weight increased with the age of strips. However, in the control field with no wood in the vicinity, the BP of carabid beetles was as high as inside the shelterbelts. The highest similarity between the shelterbelts and the field (BP, Morisita's similarity index, diversity index H', individual weight) was found in the field adjoining the youngest (aged 2 years) shelterbelt.

Previous research has shown that N fertilizer management alone is not sufficient for reducing NO3 concentrations in subsurface drainage to acceptable levels; therefore, additional approaches need to be devised. We compared two cropping system modifications for NO3 concentration and load in subsurface drainage water for a no-till corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) management system. In one treatment, eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides L.) was grown in permanent 3.05-m-wide strips above the tiles. For the second treatment, a rye (Secale cereale L.) winter cover crop was seeded over the entire plot area each year near harvest and chemically killed before planting the following spring. Twelve 30.5x42.7-m subsurface-drained field plots were established in 1999 with an automated system for measuring tile flow and collecting flow-weighted samples. Both treatments and a control were initiated in 2000 and replicated four times. Full establishment of both treatments did not occur until fall 2001 because of dry conditions. Treatment comparisons were conducted from 2002 through 2005. The rye cover crop treatment significantly reduced subsurface drainage water flow-weighted NO3 concentrations and NO3 loads in all 4 yr. The rye cover crop treatment did not significantly reduce cumulative annual drainage. Averaged over 4 yr, the rye cover crop reduced flow-weighted NO3 concentrations by 59% and loads by 61%. The gamagrass strips did not significantly reduce cumulative drainage, the average annual flow-weighted NO3 concentrations, or cumulative NO3 loads averaged over the 4 yr. Rye winter cover crops grown after corn and soybean have the potential to reduce the NO3 concentrations and loads delivered to surface waters by subsurface drainage systems.","2007","2020-10-29 20:11:37","2021-10-19 13:14:38","","1503-11","","","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, increasing denitrification rates in riparian buffers may be trading the problem of NPS pollution of surface waters for atmospheric deterioration and increased global warming potential because denitrification produces nitrous oxide (N 2 O), a greenhouse gas also involved in stratospheric ozone depletion. Also N2 O produced in the denitrification process can be dissolved in groundwater and is eventually emitted into the air when groundwater flows into a stream or a river. Riparian buffers restored from cultivated crop fields may have significant capacities as sinks or sources of CH 4 . It therefore is important to quantify the fluxes of N2 O, CH4 and dissolved N2 O, identify the source of N 2 O from different kinds of riparian buffer systems and evaluate the significance of N2 O and CH4 sources. We measured N inputs, weather conditions and N2 O and CH4 fluxes from soils in forested riparian buffers, warm-season and cool-season grass filters, and a crop field located in the Bear Creek watershed in central Iowa. We measured concentrations of NO3- , dissolved N2 O, and other chemical properties in groundwater under a multi-species riparian buffer, a cool-season grass filter, and the adjacent crop field. The forest buffer and grass filter soils had significantly lower bulk density; and higher pH, total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), and ammonium (NH 4 + ) than those in the crop field. Nitrous oxide emissions from soils in all riparian buffers (1.8-4.5 kg N2 O-N ha-1 ) were significantly less than those in the crop fields (7.2-16.8 kg N 2 O-N ha-1 ), but no differences among different kinds of riparian buffers were observed. Our results indicate that the emission factor (ratio of N2 O emission to N inputs) of soils in riparian buffers was smaller than the crop fields. While N2 O peak emissions followed by rewetting dry soils and thawing frozen soils significantly contributed to annual N2 O emissions from soils in the crop fields, soils in the riparian buffers were less sensitive to such events. Soil incubation with inhibitors indicated that the main sources of N2 O might be nitrifier denitrification and denitrification in the crop field soil and nitrifier denitrification in the riparian buffer soils. The ratio of N2 O to N2 in riparian buffer soil (0.88-6.8) was less than that found in crop field soil (16.5). These results suggest that N2 O emissions from soils in all riparian buffers were significantly less than those in the crop field. In both a multi-species riparian buffer and a cool-season grass filter, NO 3- concentrations in groundwater were significantly decreased in comparison to those in the crop field, by 48-59%. However, dissolved N 2 O concentrations in groundwater did not differ among locations (6-14 μg L-1 ). These results indicate that the riparian buffers decreased NO3- concentrations in near-surface groundwater, without increasing N2 O losses. Methane fluxes in crop field soil were not observed to be significantly different from those in the forest buffer and grass filter soils, and no significant difference in CH4 flux was found between the forest buffer and grass filter soils. Annual CH 4 flux was -0.80 kg C ha-1 yr-1 , -0.46 kg C ha-1 yr-1 , and 0.04 kg C ha-1 yr-1 in the crop field, forest buffers and grass filters, respectively. The annual CH4 flux in forest buffers and grass filters were not significantly different from zero and these three amounts were not significantly different from one another. These results suggest that (1) N2 O emissions from soils in all riparian buffers were significantly less than those in the crop field, (2) the riparian buffers decreased NO3 - concentrations in near-surface groundwater, without increasing N 2 O losses, and (3) CH4 flux in the crop field, forest buffers and grass filters were not different and CH4 flux was not changed in the forest buffers a d grass filters soils, despite that soil properties have changed significantly since the planting of the forest buffers and the grass filters.

In the case of methane (CH4), these systems have the potential to serve as sinks of CH4 or may provide favorable conditions for CH4 production. This study quantifies CH4 flux from soils of riparian buffer systems comprised of three vegetation types and compares these fluxes with those of adjacent crop fields. We measured soil properties and diel and seasonal variations of CH4 flux in 7 to 17 yr-old re-established riparian forest buffers, warm-season and cool-season grass filters, and an adjacent crop field located in the Bear Creek watershed in central Iowa.

Changes in property rights, farm size, land use and the greater importance of environmental issues demand new approaches for plant protection and habitat evaluation. In our study some examples will be given showing the importance both of fields and field margins and about their contribution to plant protection and nature production. Plant species and predators (carabids, spiders) were studied in winter wheat fields and in the field margins. Evidence was found of the importance of the field margin for the number and composition of plant species. Parallel to this, carabids and spiders (as significant predators) were studied. For both carabids and spiders, species number and diversity were significantly higher in field margins compared with fields. The species distribution of carabids among these two different habitats, however, indicates that some species are typical 'field species'. Thus, proper management of both habitats is necessary so that they may contribute to biotic diversity, A possible evaluation of the contribution of habitats to native flora and fauna is discussed.

The BMP Program is a voluntary and confidential program, which is jointly funded by the BC Ministry of Agriculture and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Since 2005 the BMP Program has provided funding to farmers to adopt agri-environmental Beneficial Management Practices (BMPs) and during this time no evaluation of the program has occurred resulting in a lack of program feedback to program directors. The specific objectives for this project were to (1) develop a methodology to conduct a social, economic and environmental outcome evaluation of BMPs adopted on BC farms; (2) evaluate the social, economic and environmental outcomes of four BMPs and; (3) make policy recommendations to the Ministry of Agriculture to allow for adaptive management of the BMP Program using the evaluation methodology. The four BMPs evaluated for this study included Alternative Watering Systems to Manage Livestock, Riparian Buffer Establishment, Irrigation Management, and Wildlife Damage Prevention. The evaluation was undertaken for four BMPs with partially overlapping surveys, which were administered with a sample of BMP adopters in the fall of 2011 with in-person interviews as well as with mail surveys. The surveys collected both baseline and social, economic and environmental BMP outcome data. Results show that environmental outcomes are positive but in some cases depend on on-going maintenance and upkeep of certain BMPs. Generally adopters of the Riparian BMPs are motivated by stewardship and environmental factors whereas adopters of the Irrigation Management and Wildlife Damage Prevention BMPs are motivated by on-farm benefits offered by the BMPs. The largest barrier to adoption for all BMPs appears to be cost; however, barriers are overall lower for both the Irrigation Management and Wildlife Damage Prevention BMPs , which is reflected in the adoption levels to date. Results of the study highlight both the outcomes of the BMP to individual farm operations, and the overall impact of the BMP Program to society and also provides critical feedback to program directors.","2012","2020-10-29 20:11:44","2020-10-29 20:11:44","","","147","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9780499228703","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Plots with perennial, herbaceous vegetation were established by natural regeneration or by sowing grass, both annually cut. Vegetation development was monitored in the first three years after establishment in the original boundary and in the new boundary strip. Species composition, species-richness and biomass production in the new strip were related to those in the original boundary to examine the potential of predicting vegetation development in extended field boundaries from the vegetation composition of the original boundary. Within three years species-richness, biomass production and monocot:dicot ratio in both the grass and regeneration plots converged to the levels of the original boundary in all three countries. Species composition in the new strip was not closely related to the original boundary, however, since only 20-50% of the species encountered in the original boundary at the onset of the experiment had managed to colonise the new boundary strip in the final year. The low similarity was mainly due to low establishment rates of annual and woodland species in the new strip while mobile, perennial grassland species were generally very successful. Sowing grass, which may be preferable with respect to weed control, had adverse effects on species-richness. These relationships, which were found to apply in a broad geographical area and in different boundary types, may aid efforts to restore botanical diversity in arable field boundaries.

In recent decades the botanical diversity of arable field boundaries has declined drastically. To determine the most important factors related to the species composition of arable field boundaries, the vegetation composition of 105 herbaceous boundaries, 1-m wide, in the central and eastern Netherlands was surveyed. Biomass samples of the boundary were taken at 0-33, 34-66 and 67-100 cm from the adjacent arable field. 2. Farmers were interviewed with respect to boundary management and land use on the adjacent arable field. The two data sets containing the botanical data and the environmental variables were linked and analysed by multivariate analysis and analysis of variance. 3. The nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to the crop were closely correlated to another environmental variable, crop rotation. Crop rotations dominated by maize cultivation received significantly higher nutrient inputs than the other rotations. 4. Nitrogen, phosphorus and crop rotation were strongly correlated with the composition of the boundary vegetation. Species richness of the boundary vegetation was negatively related to nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to the crop, while total boundary biomass was negatively related to nitrogen inputs only. Furthermore, there was a significant relationship between the partitioning of the boundary vegetation between different functional groups and both nitrogen inputs and crop rotation on the adjacent arable field. No significant relationships were found between the vegetation composition and either herbicide use in the boundary or boundary management. This may have been due to the descriptive approach of the study: little variation in boundary management as well as herbicide use in the boundary was observed in the study area. 5. The boundary vegetation was characterized by a peak in biomass production in the zone near the arable field. In this zone the perennial arable weed Elymus repens, as well as annual dicot species, were significantly more abundant, while perennial dicots and monocots were significantly less abundant compared with the zones further from the arable field. 6. Efforts to protect field boundary vegetation need to focus on a reduction or cessation of fertilizer applications in the outer metre(s) of crops that require high nutrient inputs. The determination of the exact nature of the relationship between the vegetation composition of arable field boundaries and the intuitively important management and herbicide use in the boundary requires an experimental approach.","2000","2020-10-29 20:11:46","2021-10-19 13:13:57","","256-266","","","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the ecological benefits of buffer vegetation are well established by plot- and field-scale research, buffer adoption by farmers is limited. Landscape-scale approaches can address several obstacles by simultaneously considering ecological impact, economic efficiency, and aesthetic quality and preference in buffer placement and design. Within four watersheds of Washington's Palouse farming region, we examined relationships between ecological and aesthetic responses to the existing landscape structure plus three alternative scenarios, differentiated by successive increases in woody buffers. Methodology combined GIS analysis, digital image simulation, soil erosion modeling and mapping, and a landscape preference survey. Landscape ecological function, measured by erosion and deposition rates, improved as buffer elements were added into each successive scenario. Magnitude of improvements varied among scenarios and among watersheds, revealing opportunities for targeting buffers to maximize ecological benefits and economic efficiency. Concurrently, aesthetic preference, measured as scenic quality ratings, increased significantly (p < 0.05) from the existing landscape through the second successive scenario of improved ecological function. No preference difference was found between the second and third scenarios. Results expand current understanding of multifunctional relationships in agricultural landscapes and encourage future research on whether linking ecological and aesthetic quality in buffer design might favorably influence adoption. Results also suggest that, within certain landscape contexts, visually perceivable attributes can provide a relative and coincident indication of ecological function, aesthetic quality, and agricultural sustainability.

Out of a point source water spiked with different concentrations of isoproturon, dichlorprop-p and terbuthylazine flowed with intensifies of 400 l/h, 1500 l/h and 2000 l/h. In addition, the grassed filter strip was irrigated with sprinklers with an intensity of about 14 mm/h, which corresponds to its infiltration capacity. The simulated runoff leaving the filter strip was collected and analysed for the herbicides. It was shown that the efficiency of the boundary strip in herbicide retention was mainly due to the infiltration of the runoff in the strip.","1997","2020-10-29 20:11:47","2021-10-19 13:14:12","","129-141","","","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Journal of the American Water Resources Association (JAWRA) 46(2):311-322. DOI: 10.1111/j.1752-1688.2010.00422.x Riparian forest buffers established according to accepted conservation practice standards have been recommended as one of the most effective tools for mitigating nonpoint source pollution. The midwestern United States is characterized by many kilometers of narrow, naturally occurring forests along streams. However, little is known about the relative effectiveness of these remnant forests compared with these newly established buffers. This study compared the ability of naturally occurring remnant forests with and without adjacent planted grass filters to buffer concentrated flow paths (CFPs) originating in crop fields along first- and second-order streams in three northeast Missouri watersheds. Remnant forests breached by runoff through CFPs were narrower than those that dispersed 100% of the CFPs. Remnant forests with adjacent grass buffers were nearly twice the width as those without grass filters. We also found that CFPs, which developed within remnant forests and at the base of in-field grass waterways, were potential sources of sediments to streams. Methods to mitigate these CFPs warrant further investigation. Our study suggests that although these natural remnant forests provide substantial buffering capacity, both improved management and/or the addition of an adjacent grass filter would improve water quality by reducing sediment loss to streams. Inferences can be used to inform the design and management of similar conservation buffer systems within the region.

While land management agencies in the United States promote conservation buffer strips as beneficial to wildlife populations, we know little about snake use of these habitats, especially in relation to multiscale factors. Our poor understanding of these relationships hinders effective design and management of these habitats to conserve biodiversity. We evaluated the influence of buffer design, management, and surrounding landscape characteristics on snake occurrence in grassed waterways in southeastern Iowa. We documented snakes at nearly 80% of the grassed waterways and captured 119 individual snakes of five species; one of which, the Smooth Green Snake (Lioclonorophis vernalis), is listed as a species of conservation concern in Iowa. We used a multiple logistic regression and an information theoretic approach to determine the most parsimonious local and landscape variable models that best explained snake species occurrence. The ""local"" waterway design variable, width, occurred in the best local variable models for three of the five species and was positively associated with snake presence for all three species. Landscape variable models also helped explain snake presence; individual species responded differently to the various landscape metrics. Insights gained from this study may provide opportunities for improving the conservation value of buffer strips to snakes in these fragmented landscapes.","2011","2020-10-29 20:11:50","2021-10-19 13:13:34","","191-201","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some wild-flower strips are mown or harrowed to maintain species diversity. Management and associated changes in vegetation structure may affect seed predation which is a key factor in plant population dynamics. The aims of the present work were to (1) assess the magnitude and spatial variation of seed predation in managed wildflower strips, (2) identify the responsible seed predators, and (3) investigate differences between seed species. The study was conducted in five wildflower strips in northern Switzerland; the treatments were fallow, mowing and harrowing in winter. Permanent plots were established to investigate the vegetation structure, seed removal from selectively accessible dishes, and rodent abundance in life traps. Seeds of three arable weeds were offered which an used in wildflower seed mixtures (Agrostemma githago, Camelina sativa, Centaurea cyanus). Seeds of Prunus avium were chosen to investigate exclusively predation by rodents. Losses of seed were recorded for one week in four experiments from June to August. Management had only a moderate effect on the structure of the vegetation in summer. Fallow and mown plots were similar and had a tall and dense canopy, whereas plant cover was sparse in the harrowed plots. A total of 101 plant species occurred, although most plots were dominated by Tanacetum vulgare and Elymus repens. In the harrowed plots annual species were more abundant (e.g., C. cyanus Chamomilla recutita, Papaver rhoeas). The selectively accessible dishes revealed that rodents and slugs were the main seed predators. Predation by insects and passerine birds was negligible. Rodents strongly preferred C. cyanus, whereas slugs destroyed most seed of C. sativa. After one week seed losses amounted to 43-51% in C. sativa, 23-25% C. cyanus and 10-12% A. githago. The rank order of the species was similar for the three management treatments and both study periods. Predation of C. sativa was significantly reduced in the harrowed plots, whereas the losses of C. cyanus were independent of management. Live-trapping suggested that Apodemus flavicollis and A. sylvaticus were mainly responsible for seed predation of C, cyanus; Microtus arvalis avoided harrowed plots. It is concluded that only harrowing significantly affects the vegetation structure of wildflower strips and reduces seed losses, that seed predation by rodents and slugs is high, and that arable weeds are affected to a different extent.

Nitrate pathways in the upper 2 m of groundwater were investigated beneath wooded and grass-shrub riparian zones next to cultivated fields, Because trees can be important components of the overall nitrate pathway in wooded riparian zones, water sources used by riparian trees and possible effects of trees on nitrate concentrations in groundwater were also investigated. Average nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater beneath the cultivated fields were 5.5 mg/L upgradient of the wooded riparian zone and 3.5 mg/L upgradient of the grass-shrub zone. Shallow groundwater beneath the fields passed through the riparian zones and discharged into streams that had average nitrate concentrations of 8.5 mg/L (as N). Lateral variations of delta D values in groundwater showed that mixing among different water sources occurred beneath the riparian zones. In the wooded riparian zone, nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater were diluted by upwelling, nitrate-poor, deep groundwater. Upwelling deep groundwater contained ammonium with a delta(15)N of 5 parts per thousand that upon nitrification and mixing with nitrate in shallow groundwater caused nitrate delta(15)N values in shallow groundwater to decrease by as much as 19.5 parts per thousand, Stream water penetrated laterally beneath the wooded riparian zone as far as 19 m from the stream's edge and beneath the grass-shrub zone as far as 27 m from the stream's edge. Nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater immediately upgradient of where it mixed with stream water averaged 0.4 mg/L in the wooded riparian zone and 0.8 mg/L near the grass-shrub riparian zone. Nitrate concentrations increased toward the streams because of mixing with nitrate-rich stream water. Because nitrate concentrations were larger in stream water than shallow groundwater, concentrated nitrate in the streams cannot have come from shallow groundwater at these sites. Water sources of riparian trees were identified by comparing delta D values of sap water, soil water, groundwater, and stream water. Soil water was the main water source for trees in the outer 4 to 6 m of one part of the wooded riparian zone and outer 10 m of another part. Groundwater was a significant water source fur trees closer to the streams where the water table was less than about 2.1 to 2.7 m below the surface. No evidence was found in the nitrate concentration profiles that trees close to the streams that took up groundwater through their roots also took up nitrate from groundwater. The lack of such evidence is attributed to the nitrate concentration profiles being insufficiently sensitive indicators of nitrate removal by trees.","1996","2020-10-29 20:11:51","2021-10-19 13:14:26","","1039-1050","","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this four-year field experiment, conducted on six field parcels, the ability of wildflower strips to simultaneously promote the availability of pollination services (using bumblebee abundance as a proxy), species diversity (total species richness of bumblebees, butterflies and diurnal moths) and conservation (abundance of habitat specialist butterflies) was evaluated. The results showed that the first two indicators increased strongly and rapidly in wildflower strips until the third year of the experiment. The conservation indicator increased more slowly and this response was related to the forest cover of the surrounding landscape. Furthermore, the benefits of wildflower strips were largely independent of experimentally varied strip properties. It is concluded that wildflower strips are a flexible mitigation tool to promote different biodiversity targets in agricultural systems. Pollination services and species diversity can be promoted in different kinds of landscapes by ensuring local habitat quality. In the promotion of habitat specialists, landscape matrix quality is more critical. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Appropriate agroforestry practices in Saskatchewan include field and farmyard shelterbelts, wildlife plantations, poplar plantations and managed woodlots. A study was conducted to determine the amount of carbon held in prairie shelterbelts. The effect of the soil type and tree species on biomass and carbon content was measured in shelterbelts in the brown, dark brown and black soil zones of Saskatchewan. For some of the main shelterbelt species, the mean aboveground carbon content was 79 kg/tree (32 t/km) for green ash, 263 kg/tree (105 t/km) for poplar, 144 kg/tree (41 t/km) for white spruce and 26 t/km for caragana. In the brown and the dark brown soils, which are more arid than the black soil zone, trees had 60.6% and 65.5%, respectively, of the biomass and carbon content of trees and shrubs in the black soil zone. Improved, fast-growing poplar clones had the greatest biomass at maturity and fixed the greatest amount of carbon. Simple equations were developed to calculate the carbon contents of prairie shelterbelts, based on easily measured tree or shrub parameters.

We analysed possible barrier effects of large hedges and corridor effects of narrow grass strips that were hypothesized to affect foraging and dispersal of hymenopterans. We selected calcareous grasslands in the vicinity of Göttingen (Germany), which harbour high Hymenoptera diversity and are starting points for foraging and dispersal in the landscape. We installed pan traps to sample bees (i) on the grasslands; (ii) on grassland edges behind adjacent hedges (potential barriers) and without hedges; (iii) on grass strips in 100m distance to the grassland, which were connected or unconnected to the grassland; and (iv) unconnected (isolated) grass strips in 300m and 750m distance to test for corridor and isolation effects on abundance and species richness of foraging wild bees. Additionally we provided trap nests for bees, wasps and their parasitoids on the grasslands and the strips. Species abundance and richness declined with increasing isolation from grasslands for foraging solitary bees, trap-nesting bees, wasps and parasitoids, but not for foraging bumblebees. Hedges did not confine movement of foraging bees. We found no mitigating effects of (100m) corridor strips on any of the observed groups. We conclude that conservation of semi-natural habitats as sources of bee and wasp diversity is important and that grass strips act as sinks rather than corridors when high quality patches are nearby.

Adsorption and desorption parameters for atrazine, desethylatrazine (DEA), deisopropylatrazine (DIA), and hydroxyatrazine (HA) were compared between a cultivated Houston Black clay (CS) and an adjacent 12-year-old VFS established in a mixed stand of bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] and buffalograss [Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt. Engelm)]. Adsorption and desorption isotherms were determined by batch equilibrium. The evaluated chemical and physical properties of the VFS and CS were similar with the exception of a 1.7-fold increase in the organic carbon content of the VFS. Adsorption and desorption coefficients for atrazine were at least 59% higher in VFS than in CS. The adsorption coefficient for HA was 48% higher in VFS compared with CS, but desorption was not statistically different between soils. Adsorption and desorption coefficients for IDEA and DIA were not statistically different between soils. The predicted order of mobility in CS is HA < atrazine = DIA = IDEA. In VFS, the predicted order of mobility is HA < atrazine = DIA < IDEA. These data indicate that the higher organic carbon in VFS will likely retard the transport of atrazine and HA to surface and ground waters; however, the transport rates of IDEA and DIA will be similar between soils.","2003","2020-10-29 20:11:57","2020-10-29 20:11:57","","7379-7384","","","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, the selection of foraging habitat by breeding skylarks was examined in relation to agri-environmental management on Dutch farmland. Field margin use was quantified and, based on the observed flight distances, the appropriateness of the current spatial arrangement of field margins in the study landscape was evaluated. Skylarks preferred field margins for foraging over all other habitat types relative to their surface area within the territories. The visiting rate of field margins decreased with increasing distance to the nest, and especially dropped markedly when the distance between the nest and a field margin exceeded 100 m. Analysis of the current spatial arrangement of field margins in the landscape suggested that the area of skylark breeding habitat within 100 m of a field margin could be increased by 46%. This was due to the placement of field margins alongside unsuitable breeding habitat and to the positioning of field margins at short distances from each other. The efficiency of agri-environmental management for skylarks can likely be improved by a more careful spatial arrangement of field margins in the landscape. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The study was carried out in 1998-2006 and covered four shelterbelts (planted in 1993-1996) located in the area of the Dezydery Chłapowski Landscape Park (western part of Poland). The shelterbelts were colonized by macrofungi just after planting. During first years of their growth a total of 174 species were recorded. Species composition changed significantly between initial (1998-2000) and final (2004-2006) period of study. Similarity of macrofungi communities (expressed as the Sörensen's index) between these two periods in studied shelterbelts ranged between 37 and 46%. In spite of high similarity in tree species composition between studied afforestations (69-80%), the communities of macrofungi differed strongly between these sampling plots (Sörensen's index was equal to about 40%). Pattern of changes in percentage share of functional groups, i.e. parasitic, mycorrhizal and saprotrophs (humicolous, lignicolous, litter-inhibiting and muscicolous ones) in individual afforestations was different but the diversity of the communities measured with the Shannon-Weaver H' index on the basis of share of functional groups tended to increase with ageing of afforestations. On average, the share of fungi growing on soil (ectomycorrhizal and humicolous saprotrophic species) was highest among all distinguished groups. Species composition of particular functional group was changing during the study period. A species representing new groups (lignicolous saprotrophs and parasites) were appearing in some shelterbelts in successive years. There were recorded some species rare in Poland, eg. Psilocybe (Stropharia) melanosperma (Bull. ex Pers.: Fr.) Noordel., Clavariadelphus fistulosus (Holmsk.: Fr.) Corner, Thelephora caryophyllea (Schaeff.): Fr., Agrocybe arvalis (Fr.)

Occurrence of rare and threatened species in young shelterbelts indicates that such afforestations, planted in crop fields but not treated by agricultural practices, contribute to the protection of species richness of macrofungi associated with tree communities and they are important substitute habitats for many species.","2008","2020-10-29 20:11:59","2021-10-19 13:13:47","","45-56","","","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bird density was estimated by mapping method in successive years 1996-2001 and the data were combined and analysed in respect to age of shelterbelts. Eighteen breeding species were found (5-8 pairs km-1), among them most abundant were Corn Bunting (Miliaria calandra) (with dominance of 33%), Yellow Wagtail (Motacilla flava) (19%) and Whitethroat (Sylvia communis) (12%). No trend in the changes of species richness and total density was recorded. The density of species preferring building nests and/or feeding in herb layer (like Yellow Wagtail, Skylark Alauda arvensis and Whinchat Saxicola rubetra) decreased during study period while the density of species associated to higher layers of vegetation like Yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella), Red-backed Shrike (Lanius collurio) increased.

The external benefits to society can be worth as much as the private benefits to producers. However, the external benefits have not been quantified or monetized in a well-documented way. In this study, external benefits were estimated for tree seedlings distributed by the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Shelterbelt Centre in the Canadian Prairie Provinces for the period 1981-2001. Estimation of these benefits required information on the biophysical changes caused by shelterbelts and their valuation. Using literature, we estimated that the value of these external benefits amounted to over $140 million (2001 CDN$; CDN$1 = US$0.63). The majority of this value was derived from carbon sequestration ($73 million) and reduced soil erosion ($15 million) services with the remainder being contributed by biodiversity and water and air quality services. Other external benefits, such as health values, transportation safety, aesthetics and property values were identified but could not be estimated due to a lack of data. The estimated value for external benefits conferred by shelterbelts in this study indicates that they are large and suggests that both private and external benefits need to be considered in formulating policies or programs so that benefits to the society can be maximized. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","2009","2020-10-29 20:12:00","2021-10-19 13:13:58","","39-47","","","75","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seven sampling locations along the Bear Creek watershed were monitored for nitrate-N concentration. Event based samples were taken at a site mid-watershed next to an instrumented weir in order to assess the NO 3- -N concentration response during a storm event. A stage-discharge rating curve was developed in order to quantify NO3- -N flux. Nitrate-N concentrations were relatively high during the study period and would have exceeded the EPA's maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 10 mg L-1 for drinking water at a majority of the sites throughout the year. The headwater of West Bear Creek (a tributary of Bear Creek) was over the MCL 89% of the time, which was the highest for any of the seven sites. The furthest downstream site, was over the MCL the least amount of time of any site, but was still higher than 10 mg L-1 47% of the time. There was a general trend of decreasing NO 3 - -N concentration from the headwaters to the outlet of Bear Creek. A spatial gradient was more profound during the spring and fall months, which was attributed to the effects of subsurface drainage. Spring consistently had the highest NO3- -N concentrations of all the seasons for each of the sampling sites. NO3- -N concentrations were the lowest during the summer months when subsurface drainage was limited and conditions are ideal for in-stream processing. Event samples showed that there was a lag between peak NO3- -N concentrations and the peak in the hydrograph. Sediment delivery models based on plot studies have been developed to predict watershed sediment yield. The modified universal soil loss equation (MUSLE) predicts sediment yield applicable to individual storm events. A major limitation to the MUSLE is that it does not take into account the effects of concentrated flow leading to ephemeral gully (EG) erosion. The formation of an EG provides a direct link from the uplands to the streams which increases sediment delivered from sheet and rill flow by reducing the surface roughness. Two study sites were located on the Southern Iowa Drift Plain ecoregion to quantify the amount of sediment loss in small catchments with ephemeral gullies. The observed amount of sediment loss was then compared to the MUSLE predicted amount of sediment loss for each individual storm event. The disparity among the predicted and observed sediment yields increased with storm size. A general weakness with the MUSLE is that rainfall events are based on a 24 hour rainfall depth and not intensity which is a dominant factor in how much rainfall will result in runoff. Riparian buffers have been accepted as an edge of field best management practice to improve surface water quality by reducing the sediment and nutrients transported in surface runoff. Many plot scale studies under uniform flow conditions have assessed the effectiveness of various riparian buffers at mitigating the effects of concentrated flow. The purpose of this study was to examine, at the hillslope scale and natural rainfall conditions, the impact that concentrated flow has on edge of field practices. The study was conducted on two private farms located in the Lake Darling and Lake Rathbun watersheds located in the Southern Iowa Drift Plain physiographic region. The three sites located in the Lake Rathbun watershed consisted of one control, located at the crop field/buffer interface, and two sites with a 15.2 m wide grass filter treatment. The three sites located in the Lake Darling watershed consisted of one control, located at the crop field/buffer interface, and two sites with a 15.2 m wide natural riparian forest buffer. Potential pollutants monitored were total sediment, nitrate-N, ortho-P, total-N, and total-P. The grass filter strips reduced pollutant load relative to the control at the field edge in smaller rain events. However, one of the grass filter sites was not effective at reducing pollu ant l ad during larger events. There appears to be a threshold that is dependent upon the amount and intensity of rain, and the contributing area to effective buffer ratio. The riparian forests were less predictable for which storm events they can be considered effective. This is because there is little to no resistance to concentrated flow within the riparian forest, as concentrated flow forms a classic gully within the buffer.

Two grasses (tall wheatgrass and alfalfa) and seven forb species (fiddleneck tarweed, dog fennel, kochia, downey brome, tall annual willowherb, prickly lettuce, and tumble mustard) commonly found in these buffers were examined to determine their chemical composition, potential bioethanol yields, and difficulties that may arise if they were to be harvested and processed in a single facility. Potential ethanol yields calculated on the basis of sugar monomer composition in the biomass ranged from 181.5 to 316.5 l/dry ton of biomass. Significant differences were noted in terms of structural sugars (cellulose 19%-33% w/w; hemicellulose 14%-26% w/w), lignin (10%-18% w/w), extractives (20%-40% w/w), and ash content (4.0%-13.8% w/w).

The objective of this study was to evaluate differences in root length density (RLD) and root and soil carbon content within grass buffer (GB), agroforestry buffer (AgB), rotationally grazed pasture (RG) and continuously grazed pasture (CG) treatments. Pasture and GB areas included red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) and lespedeza (Kummerowia stipulacea Maxim.) planted into fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) while AgB included Eastern cottonwood trees (Populus deltoids Bortr. ex Marsh.) planted into fescue. One-meter deep soil cores were collected from each treatment in August 2007 and 2008 with a soil probe. Three soil cores were sampled at six replicate sampling positions. Soil cores were collected in plastic tubes inserted inside the metal soil probe. Soils were segregated by horizons, and roots were separated into three diameter classes (0-1, 1-2, > 2 mm) by soil horizon. Root length was determined using a flatbed scanner assisted with computer software. Buffer treatments (167 cm/100 cm(3)) had 4.5 times higher RLD as compared to pasture treatments (37.3 cm/100 cm(3)). The AgB treatment had the highest (173.5 cm/100 cm(3)) RLD and CG pasture had the lowest (10.8 cm/100 cm(3)) value. Root carbon was about 3% higher for the buffers compared to RG treatment. Soil carbon was about 115% higher for the buffers compared to pasture treatments. Results from this study imply that establishment of agroforestry and GB on grazed pasture watersheds improve soil carbon accumulation and root parameters which enhance soil physical and chemical properties thus improving the environmental quality of the landscape.","2010","2020-10-29 20:12:04","2021-10-19 13:14:42","","85-96","","","80","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hydrologic simulation models assist in predicting the effects of buffers on runoff and sediment losses from small watersheds. The objective of this study was to calibrate, validate and simulate runoff and sediment losses and compare buffer effects on NPSP losses relative to control watersheds (no buffer) for seven years. The experimental design consists of four watersheds under pasture management which were monitored from 2002 through 2008; two with agroforestry buffers (AgB 100 and AgB 300) and two control watersheds (CW 400 and CW 600). Pasture areas included red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) and lespedeza (Kummerowia stipulacea Maxim.) planted into fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) while the agroforestry buffer area included Eastern cottonwood trees (Populus deltoids Bortr. ex Marsh.) planted into fescue. The APEX model was calibrated from 2002 to 2005 and was validated from 2006 to 2008. The r (2) and NSE values for the calibration and validation periods of the runoff varied from 0.52 to 0.78 and 0.50 to 0.74, respectively. The model did not predict sediment loss very well probably due to insufficient number of measured events and low measured sediment loss. The measured runoff was 57% higher for CW watersheds compared to AgB watersheds. The measured sediment loss was 95% higher for CW watersheds compared to AgB watersheds. After calibrating and validating the model, it was run for long-term scenario analyses for 10 years from 1999 to 2008. Simulated buffer width had a significant influence on runoff. Simulated runoff decreased by 24% when the buffer width was doubled compared to losses associated with the measured buffer width. Simulated runoff from the CW watersheds was 11% higher with double stocking density (relative to measured density) compared to AgB watersheds with double stocking density. With half stocking density (relative to measured density), the AgB watershed had 18% lower runoff compared to CW. Results from this study imply that establishment of agroforestry buffers on grazed pasture watersheds reduce runoff and sediment losses compared to control watersheds without buffers.","2011","2020-10-29 20:12:05","2020-10-29 20:12:05","","51-62","","","83","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To meet North Carolina mandates of reducing nitrogen loads in selected rivers by 30% over a five-year period, scientists proposed guidelines to meet this goal. Riparian buffers and controlled drainage are two Best Management Practices (BMPs) than have been shown to reduce the amount of nitrogen entering surface and subsurface waters as a result of denitrification, but they are not always effective or practical on all landscapes. In 1998, a project to study the effect of using riparian buffers in conjunction with controlled drainage was initiated. Soil redox potential is an indicator that provides evidence as to whether or not conditions are favorable for denitrification. Four riparian buffers at widths of 7.6 or 15.2 m, with five vegetative treatments (fescue, switch grass, pine trees, field crop, and native vegetation), were established. Groundwater monitoring wells, at three depths, were installed at the edge of the ditch, the field edge, and in the field in each treatment. A water control structure was installed at the mouth of one of the ditches. A total of 176 redox electrodes were inserted to 76 cm or 152 cm at the ditch and field edges of the riparian buffers. By raising the water table with controlled drainage, conditions favoring denitrification were enhanced. Results from this one-year study show that buffers with controlled drainage at a depth of 152 cm had low redox values favorable for denitrification and subsequently lower nitrate concentrations in the groundwater as compared to areas with buffers, but no control.","2000","2020-10-29 20:12:05","2020-10-29 20:12:05","","","193-193 p.","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9780599800632; 0599800631","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Emigration of released T. brassicae from maize fields into non-target habitats was monitored, and its persistence in non-target habitats was assessed throughout the season. For this purpose, sticky traps were installed on metal sticks along transects from the inside of T. brassicae treated maize fields into sown wildflower strips and a natural common reed stand. In addition, cards with host eggs were used to monitor Trichogramma within potential overwintering sites. Although the highest numbers of released parasitoids were trapped within maize, a considerable amount of T. brassicae moved into non-target habitats. We found a significant transient increase of T. brassicae in both wildflower strips and reeds and no consistent decrease in numbers of trapped wasps up to 40 m from the maize field borders, when monitored directly following mass releases. Indigenous Trichogramma species were present both in the wildflower strip and reeds, and T. brassicae represented only a minor part of the overall Trichogramma population therein, except for a few days after release. However, a few T. brassicae persisted in non-target habitats throughout the season and were still present prior to releases in the subsequent year. These low numbers are not expected to seriously affect populations of native Trichogramma or non-target host species.

These solutions are generally efficient at reducing polluted surface flows, mainly by infiltration of the soil, raising the question of the fate of the infiltrated pollutants. An environmental evaluation was conducted on the efficiency of a grass strip receiving diuron-contaminated water from an uphill vineyard in France. During two runoff events, the following measurements were taken: surface inflow and outflow with Venturi flumes, vertical percolated flow below the root layer (0-50 cm), and variations in water and solute content of the root layer. One runoff event occurred under natural rainfall conditions, while the other runoff event was artificially provoked with water doped by diuron and bromide. For the natural runoff event, representative of medium intensity events, 94% of the diuron was retained in the root layer, whereas 2% left the grass strip by surface runoff and 4% left the grass strip in the water percolating under the root zone. For the artificial event, representative of intense runoff events, more than half of the incoming diuron was retained by the grass strip, whereas 24% and 18% of it were transferred by surface runoff and percolation, respectively. These results showed that the capacity of the root layer to retain diuron was highly significant despite a large percolation flux. However, for large runoff events, surface and subsurface losses can still be considerable, up to 40% of the pesticide load entering the strip.","2012","2020-10-29 20:12:07","2021-10-19 13:13:50","","580-592","","","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Grass leys occurred in all the sampled territories as did hazel and bramble. In general the species composition of the vegetation was variable and considered of little importance compared with habitat structure. The distribution of occupied territories over the whole study area was related to various features of the habitat, mostly the area of shrub layer and length of shrub/open field edge.

The objective of this study was to assess the efficiency of 0-m, 3-m, 6-m and 9-m grass filter strips to reduce masses of dissolved metolachlor, atrazine and deethylatrazine (a degradation product of atrazine) exported in runoff. For that purpose, 16 uncultivated plots (3-m widex65-m long) with 0-m-, 3-m-, 6-m- and 9-m-long grass filter strips were setup in a completely randomized block design. During four seasons, masses of dissolved atrazine, metolachlor and deethylatrazine were determined for the first four to five rain events, under natural rain conditions, after atrazine and metolachlor application. Generally, grass filter strips reduced exported herbicide masses by more than 90% and influenced atrazine and metolachlor dissipation kinetics in the field. The 3-m grass filter strip (area ratio source/strip of 22:1) usually provided a reduction in exported herbicide masses similar to the 6- or 9-m grass filter strips. Therefore, under the present experimental soil and climate conditions, a grass filter strip of 3m would be a good compromise between environmental protection of surface waters against atrazine and metolachlor contamination and conservation of agricultural land use. Such an approach contributes to the acceptability by producers to implement optimized best management practices such as vegetated filter strips for the preservation of the quality of water resources.","2013","2020-10-29 20:12:10","2021-10-19 13:14:04","","87-97","","","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our aims were firstly to examine factors controlling spatial variation in bank erosion, secondly to estimate sediment and phosphorus (P) loss via bank erosion. The overall mean bank erosion rate was 11 mm year(-1). Bank erosion rate over the 2-year period was significantly related to a number of site-specific characteristics, including bank angle, bank vegetation cover, overhanging bank and estimated stream power. An empirical model for bank erosion based on these descriptive variables yielded a 55% explanation of the observed spatial variation in bank erosion rate. Bank erosion was higher at the lower 50-cm bank section (20 mm year(-1)) than at the upper bank (6 mm year(-1)). Cattle fencing in grazed areas and buffer zones with riparian woodland lowered bank erosion rates. We found that total P content of bank material was high (0.64 g P kg(-1)) and at the same level as found in agricultural topsoil along the streams. The overall annual catchment loss of bank-derived clay-silt sediment and total P to streams amounted to 58-72 kg sediment ha(-1) and 0.23-0.28 kg P ha(-1), respectively. In comparison, the mean annual suspended sediment (SS) and total P losses from 14 similar sized Danish agricultural catchments were 122 kg SS ha(-1) and 0.58 kg P ha(-1) over the 2-year study period. Thus, bank erosion seems to be a major contributor of suspended sediment and P in this type of small channelized lowland stream.

Carabid beetles are polyphagous predators that can act as biological control agents of insect pests and weeds. While current agricultural practices often create a harsh environment, habitat management such as the establishment of within-field refuges has been proposed to enhance carabid beetle abundance and impact. We examined the joint effects of refuge habitats and insecticide application on carabid activity density(parameter of population density and relative activity) and species composition in a cornfield. 2. Our 2-year study comprised four treatments: (i) -refuge/-insecticide; (ii) +refuge/ -insecticide; (iii) -refuge/+insecticide; (iv) +refuge/+insecticide. Refuge strips consisted of grasses, legumes and perennial flowering plants. '-Refuge' strips were planted with corn and not treated with insecticide. 3. Before planting and insecticide application, carabid activity density in the crop areas was similar across all treatments. Insecticide application immediately reduced carabid activity density and altered community composition in the crop area. 4. Refuge strips had significantly higher activity density of beetles than -refuge strips before planting and during the summer. 5. During summer, as new carabids emerged and insecticide toxicity declined, the presence of refuge strips influenced carabids in the adjacent crop area. Carabid activity density within crop areas previously treated with insecticide was significantly higher when adjacent to refuge strips. Also, carabid communities within insecticide-treated crop areas were affected by the presence or absence of a refuge strip. 6. The presence of refuge strips did not consistently augment carabid numbers in crop areas where insecticide was not applied. One explanation may be that insecticides decreased the quality of crop habitat to carabids by depletion of prey and direct mortality. However, subsequent rebounds in prey density and the absence of competing predators may make these areas relatively more attractive than unperturbed crop habitats to carabid colonization from refuges. 7. This study demonstrates that refuges may buffer the negative consequences of insecticide application on carabids in adjacent fields. Diversifying agro-ecosystems with refuge habitats may be a viable strategy for maintaining carabid populations in disturbed agricultural landscapes to keep pests below outbreak levels.","2001","2020-10-29 20:12:15","2021-10-19 13:14:35","","","","","- 38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4; - 56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data collected from paired buffered and unbuffered headwater catchments at three sites with conditions representative of much of the agricultural land in England and Wales, showed that grassed buffers did not substantially reduce nitrate-nitrogen concentrations entering the streams. Median nitrate-nitrogen levels observed in buffered catchments ranged from 7.6 to 18.8 mgN 1-1, but peaked at up to 46.1 mgN 1-1. The existence of preferential bypass flow paths during the winter flow events limited the effectiveness of nitrate removing processes within the strips. The findings suggest that grassed riparian buffer strips may not be effective in controlling diffuse nitrate pollution unless the hydrology of the strip allows a suitable environment for denitrification and/or plant uptake. Grassed buffer strips should be carefully targeted or, alternatively, engineered to ensure adequate residence time of solutes within the strip.","1999","2020-10-29 20:12:16","2021-10-19 13:14:00","","299-313","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While there have been many studies of the transport of pollutants through grass filter strips, few have addressed sediment related processes through restored tree belts. In order to identify these processes and quantify their relative contribution to sediment trapping. a series of rainfall simulations was conducted oil a 600 m(2) hillslope comprising a pasture upslope of a 15 year old tree belt. Although the simulated events were extreme (average recurrence intervals similar to 10 and 50 yr), the trapping efficiency of the tree belt was very high: at least 94% of the total mass of sediments was captured. All the size fractions were trapped with a minimum Sediment Trapping Ratio (STR) of 91 % for the medium-sized fragments. Fractions < 1.3 mu m and > 182 mu m were totally captured (STR = 100%). Through the joint analysis of sediment budgets and Soil surface conditions, we identified different trapping processes. The main trapping process is the sedimentation (at least 62% of trapped sediment mass) with deposits in the backwater and as rnicro-terraces within the tree belt. Modelling results show that the coarsest size fractions above 75 pill are preferentially deposited. Joint infiltration of water and sediments has also been noticed, however, this process alone cannot explain the selective trapping of the finest fractions. We suggest that the finest fractions transported by the overland flow may be trapped by adsorption oil the abundant litter present within the tree belt.

A study was conducted in 2001 and 2002 that combined PAM with: 1) surge irrigation, 2) grass filter strips, 3) check dams, and 4) surface drains. In order to test the treatments under different cultural practices and slopes, the study was conducted at three site: two vineyards with silt loam soils at 1.2% slope in both the furrows and the tailwater ditch, and a cornfield with silt loam and sandy loam soil at 0.2% slope in both the furrows and the tailwater ditch. During irrigation events, sediment samples were taken and outflow rates were recorded at periodic intervals to determine sediment concentration, run-off volume, and sediment load from each treatment. At all sites and at all monitored irrigations, the control plot, which had only the patch application of PAM, produced sediment concentrations greater than the total maximum daily load standard of 56 mg .L-1 for the Lower Yakima River All four erosion control practices in combination with PAM were more effective in reducing sediment load at the vineyards as compared to the cornfield. Only the grass treatment with PAM was consistent in reducing sediment concentrations below 56 mg .L-1 in both the vineyards and the cornfield.","2005","2020-10-29 20:12:17","2021-10-19 13:13:53","","595-603","","","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Weed strips were established in a field of winter wheat in northern Germany in the spring of 1994. Spiders were sampled with pitfall traps and D-vac suction sampling throughout the year. Experiments showed that weed strips can play an important role as overwintering habitats for common spider species of arable land. Spring emigration from the weed strips into the crop was especially recorded for Oedothorax apicatus (Blackwall) (Araneae: Erigonidae), a species which depends on semi-natural habitats for overwintering. The results indicate that for species with a high potential for aerial dispersal like Erigone atra (Blackwall) (Araneae: Erigonidae), the proximity of refuge habitats is less important than for species that disperse predominantly over the soil surface like O. apicatus.

During this research, several harmful species were observed, but always of very low abundance, except the blossom bettles, Meligethes spp.. They were, first of all, dependent on rape, but after the rape flowering time the new generation was found everywhere searching for food (pollen), especially on yellow flowers such as Sinapis alba in the strips. Oulema spp., Psylliodes chrysocephala, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, Phyllotreta spp. (Chrysomelidae) and the Centorhynchus species (Curculionidae) were always connected to their host plant in the field and have only been caught more frequently in presence of the respective field. Sitona and Apion weevils also showed low abundance in the strips during both investigation periods. According to these results, weed strips have no enhancing effect on pest species, but in some cases they can offer food resources during the seasonal absence of the crop, as for the beneficial groups, too. The greatest diversity was revealed in the weed strips, even with rare species for Switzerland. Therefore, strip-management, providing ecological compensation areas, is an important measure for maintaining species conservation and contributes to biodiversity and sustainable agriculture.","1997","2020-10-29 20:12:19","2021-10-19 13:13:50","","75-92","","1","104","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","agriculture; eppi-reviewer4; Chrysomelidae; Curculionidae; Nitidulidae; pest species; Strip-management","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The MMS cross-sectional survey consisted of samples collected during 1 yr on nine different dairies from six loafing barns, nine primary lagoons, 12 secondary lagoons, and six irrigation sample points. Pasture runoff samples were additionally analyzed for Cryptosporidium sp. and Giardia duodenalis, whereby detectable concentrations occurred sporadically at higher FCB concentrations resulting in poor correlations with FCB. Prevalence of both parasites was lower relative to high-use areas studied simultaneously on these same farms. Application of manure to pastures more than 2 wk in advance of storm-associated runoff was related to a >= 80% reduction in FCB concentration and load compared to applications within 2 wk before a runoff event. For every 10 m of buffer length, a 24% reduction in FCB concentration was documented. A one-half (75%), one (90%), and two (99%) log10 reduction in manure FCB concentration was observed for manure holding times in MMS of approximately 20, 66, and 133 d, respectively.

The aim of this study was to estimate the dispersal success of forest-dwelling plants from a stand into and along an attached woody corridor, and to explain the observed patterns from the point of view of species' dispersal traits and corridor properties. We sampled 47 forest-corridor transects in the agricultural landscapes of southeastern Estonia. Regionally common forest-dwelling species (observed in at least 10 % of seed-source forests) were classified on the basis of their ecological response profile-forest-restricted species (F-type) and forest-dwelling generalists (G-type). Species richness and the proportion of F-type species decreased sharply from the seed-source forest core to the forest edge and to the first 10-15 m of the corridor, while G-type species richness remained constant throughout the transect. Corridor structure had a species-specific effect-F species were promoted by old (a parts per thousand yen50 years) and wide (a parts per thousand yen10 m) corridors, while G species were supported by young and narrow corridors with ditch-related soil disturbances. Moderate shade (canopy cover < 75 %) was optimal for all forest-dwelling species. Large dispersule weight, and not seed weight, dispersal vector or Ellenberg's indicator values, was the trait that differentiated F species from G species. We conclude that most woody corridors are only dispersal stepping-stone habitats for habitat generalist species, and not for specialists. Only century old corridors can relieve the dispersal limitation of forest-restricted species.","2013","2020-10-29 20:12:22","2020-10-29 20:12:22","","455-470","","","214","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to estimate the effects of conservation practices on hydraulic properties and root-zone water dynamics of the soil. A 3-year experiment was performed on a slope at Xianning. Four treatments were evaluated for their ability to reduce soil erosion and improve soil water conditions. Compared with no practices (CK) and living grass strips (GS), the application of polyacrylamide (PAM) significantly reduced soil crust formation during intense rainfall, whereas rice straw mulching (SM) completely abolished soil crust formation. The SM and PAM treatments improved soil water-stable aggregates, with a redistribution of micro-aggregates into macro-aggregates. PAM and SM significantly increased the soil water-holding capacity. These practices mitigated the degradation of the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) during intense rainfalls. These methods increased soil water storage but with limited effects during heavy rainfalls in the wet period. In contrast, during the dry period, SM had the highest soil water storage, followed by PAM and CK. Grass strips had the lowest soil water storage because of the water uptake during the vigorous grass growth. A slight decline in the soil moisture resulted in a significant decrease in the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (Ku) of the topsoil. Therefore, the hydraulic conductivity in the field is governed by soil moisture, and the remaining soil moisture is more important than improving soil properties to resist short-term droughts. As a result, SM is the most effective management practice when compared with PAM and GS, although they all protect the soil hydraulic properties during wet periods. These results suggest that mulching is the best strategy for water management in erosion-threatened and drought-threatened red soils.

However, their efficiency with respect to nitrate (NO3 (-)), ammonium (NH4 (+)), or soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in groundwater remains uncertain in the US Midwest. This study investigates water table fluctuations and NO3 (-), NH4 (+), and SRP concentration dynamics in two riparian zone types (outwash vs. glacial till) common in the upper US Midwest. During low water table periods, NO3 (-) removal was 93 % at WR (outwash site), and 75 % at LWD (glacial till site); but during high water table periods, NO3 (-) removal efficiencies dropped to 50 % at WR, and 14 % at LWD. Median seasonal mass fluxes of NO3 (-) removed at WR (9.4-21.7 mg N day(-1) m(-1) of stream length) and LWD (0.4-1.9 mg N day(-1) m(-1)) were small compared to other riparian zones in glaciated landscapes. The WR site was a small SRP sink (0.114 and 0.118 mg day(-1) m(-1) during the dry period and wet period, respectively), while LWD acted as a small SRP source to the stream (0.004 mg day(-1) m(-1) during the dry period; 0.075 mg day(-1) m(-1) during the wet period). Both LWD and WR acted as sources of NH4 (+) to the stream with mass fluxes ranging from 0.17 to 7.75 mg N day(-1) m(-1).

As the core water region for the ""South-to-North Water Transfer Project"", certain measures should be implemented to ensure the safe of water quality. In consideration of the poor socioeconomic position of local farmers, the application of the low cost contour hedgerows had been an important measure of the utilization and conservation of slope land. However, there is a lack of information on different contour hedgerows on control of nutrient, soil and water loss in Danjiangkou Reservoir region. Based on the wheat-maize rotation pattern, a runoff experiment was conducted on a sloping land with a gradient of 14° to investigate the impact of different contour hedgerows on control of nutrient, soil and water loss on sloping land in Danjiangkou Reservoir region. Results showed that hedgerows could notably reduce soil erosion and runoff soon after their establishment, the Lonicera japonica Thunb. hedgerow showed the best effect on it. All of the four tested hedgerows could reduce slope gradient in a certain extent, while Lonicera japonica Thunb. hedgerow exhibited the most obvious effect on it. Hedgerow treatments could effectively reduce soil nutrient loss.

To more comprehensively assess the effectiveness of combined BMPs on water quality requires large-scale, long-term (>10 year) studies measuring key water quality parameters. One such suite of critical water quality parameters includes water clarity, total suspended solids (TSS), and total dissolved solids (TDS).To address this, Beasley Lake, a 25 ha (62 ac) oxbow lake located in a 915 ha (2,261 ac) watershed of intensive row crop agricultural activity, was studied. The lake was sediment impaired when monitoring was initiated in 1995 and was a candidate to assess the effectiveness of watershed-wide BMPs on lake water clarity (as Secchi depth), TSS concentrations, and TDS. A variety of BMPs within row crop fields, at field edges throughout the watershed, and enrollment of 112 ha (277 ac) into the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) between 1997 to 2006 focused on reducing soil erosion and concomitant sediment runoff. Selected parameters were measured approximately biweekly from 1996 to 2009. During this 14-year period, changes in row crop management and BMP implementations and alterations were observed and recorded in con-junction with targeted water quality parameters. While annual improvement in water quality occurred, distinct seasonal effects were noticeable. Observed changes in water clarity and TSS concentrations were greatest during spring and least in winter in association with increased BMPs, vegetated buffer strips west of the lake, and CRP north of the lake. Observed decreases in TDS concentrations were greatest during summer and fall in association with implemented CRP north of the lake. Reductions in spring TSS by >60% often direcdy increased spring water clarity by >100%. Results of this study indicate clear improvement in lake water quality with watershed-wide implementation of integrated multiple agricultural BMPs, and these improvements, manifested most strongly during spring, will assist to promote a healthy, sus-tainable lake ecosystem.

USDA Conservation Reserve Program MRB contracts last 10-15 years; evidence shows MRB soil quality may improve within 3-7 years, but there is little data on how MRB soils perform after contracts typically expire. Slaked soil aggregate stability was measured in a 20-21 year-old MRB in central Iowa at the surface (0-15 cm) and used to calculate the indices mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD), and percent water-stable macroaggregates (%WSA). The MRB contained zones of switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum L. 'Cave-in-Rock'), hybrid poplar ( Populus spp. ), and cool-season grass; results were compared with an adjacent crop field, a formerly grazed pasture, and a natural riparian forest. Bulk density, total soil carbon, and POM were also measured. A Cornell sprinkle infiltrometer was used to measure infiltration in a 10-year old tree and cool-season grass MRB, and in the switchgrass, cool-season grass and silver maple zones of the MRB used in the soil aggregate study. MRBs were compared with trafficked and non-trafficked crop interrows in a nearby crop field. Perennial vegetation had greater MWD, GMD, %WSA, and total SOC compared to the crop field. Data collected in 1997 showed no significant differences in %WSA or MWD between switchgrass and crop field, but did between cool-season grasses and crop field. However, %WSA and MWD under switchgrass increased 45.8% and 120.5%, respectively, since 1997; under cool-season grasses %WSA and MWD increased 17.9% and 34.3%, respectively, since 1997, but decreased by 37.0% and 35.2% under row crops. Sixty-minute cumulative infiltration did not significantly differ among MRBs, but was greater than trafficked crop interrows, and was best explained by rainfall rate, bulk density, and initial saturation. Percent rooted vegetation was not a significant factor explaining infiltration in MRBs. Results suggest MRBs do continue to positively impact selected soil physical parameters. Switchgrass may take longer to improve soil quality parameters in MRBs. Soil quality improvements depend upon the edaphic factors and the amount of disturbance on site.","2015","2020-10-29 20:12:27","2020-10-29 20:12:27","","","111","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9781339144467","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Denitrification (acetylene block technique on intact cores) and soil N pools were determined bimonthly for 3 yr. The higher rate of manure application had higher denitrification rates and higher sail nitrate. Depth 1 soil (0-6 cm) had higher denitrification, nitrate, and ammonium than depth 2 soil (6-12 cm). The vegetation treatment consisting of 20 m of grass and 10 m of forest had lower denitrification. Denitrification did not vary significantly with position in the plot (7, 14, 21, and 28 m downslope), but nitrate decreased in the downslope direction while ammonium increased downslope. Denitrification ranged from 4 to 12% of total from N applied in the manure. Denitrification rates were similar to those from a nearby dairy manure irrigation site, but were generally a lower percent of N applied, especially at the high swine effluent rate.

Herbicides were applied to an upland corn crop in March of each year The buffer system was managed based on USDA recommendations and averaged 50 m in width. The system included a grass buffer strip immediately adjacent to the field (Zone 3); a managed pine forest downslope from the grass buffer (Zone 2); and a narrow hardwood forest containing the stream channel system (Zone I). After the first year of the study, the managed forest was clear-cut in 1/3 and thinned in 1/3 of Zone 2. The other 1/3 of Zone 2 was left as mature for est. Most of the herbicide transport in surface runoff occurred before 30 June with about 25 cm of cumulative rainfall after herbicide application. During this period of higher herbicide transport, atrazine and alachlor concentrations averaging 34.1 mu g L-1 and 9.1 mu g L-1 at the field edge, respectively, were reduced to 1 mu g L-1 or less as runoff neared the stream. There were generally no differences among the mature forest and the two treatment areas (clear-cut and thinned) for either concentration or load in surface runoff Using precipitation data collected on site, the effects of dilution versus other concentration reduction factors (infiltration, adsorption) was estimated for surface runoff. Concentration reduction was greatest per meter of flow length in the grass buffer adjacent to the field. There was only minor transport of herbicides through the buffer system in shallow groundwater and little difference between the Zone 2 treatment areas. In 1992 and 1993, herbicide concentrations in shallow groundwater in the RFBS and at the edge-of-field were generally at or below detection limits.

Hedges and forest remnants may mitigate biodiversity loss by enhancing landscape heterogeneity and providing habitat to a wide range of species, including birds. However, nest predation, the major cause of reproductive failure of birds, has been shown to be higher in forest edges than in forest interiors. Little is known about how spatial arrangement (configuration) of hedges affects the avian nest predation. We performed an experiment with artificial ground and elevated nests (resembling yellowhammer and whitethroat nests) baited with quail and plasticine eggs. Nests were placed in three habitat types with different degrees of isolation from forests: forest edges, hedges connected to forests and hedges isolated from forests. Nest predation was highest in forest edges, lowest in hedges connected to forests and intermediate in isolated hedges. In the early breeding season, we found similar nest predation on ground and elevated nests, but in the late breeding season nest predation was higher on ground nests than on elevated nests. Small mammals were the main predators of ground nests and appeared to be responsible for the increase in predation from early to late breeding season, whereas the elevated nests were mainly depredated by small birds and small mammals. High predation pressure at forest edges was probably caused by both forest and open-landscape predators. The influence of forest predators may be lower at hedges, leading to lower predation pressure than in forest edges. Higher predation pressure in isolated than connected hedges might be an effect of concentration of predators in these isolated habitats. We conclude that landscape configuration of hedges is important in nest predation, with connected hedges allowing higher survival than isolated hedges and forest edges. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Spiders are important pest predators in agroecosystems and in maize, and can be exposed to the Bt toxin by herbivorous or pollen-collecting prey, by active Bt maize pollen feeding, and by ingesting their pollen-dusted webs. The foliage-dwelling spider fauna of Bt maize fields and adjacent margins was monitored and compared to non-transgenic maize fields. The study took place during the vegetation seasons of 2001–2003 in Bavaria, South Germany. Maize fields and adjacent nettle field margins were colonized by a typical spider assemblage, dominated by space-web spiders (Theridiidae and Linyphiidae). Abundance and species richness of spiders was higher in nettle margins than in maize fields. The proportion of hunting spiders tended to be higher in nettle margins, whereas space-web spiders tended to be more frequent in maize fields. Bt maize showed no consistent effect on individual numbers, species richness and guild structure of spiders in maize fields and adjacent nettle field margin strips. The spider abundance was higher in Bt treatments in 2003, whereas in 2001 and 2002 no significant differences were found. The results provide an important contribution for the implementation of case-specific and general surveillance of transgenic plants to be employed due to the regulations of the European Community.

The study aims were to compare soil oribatid mite diversity at sites within agricultural land and to assess the role of different land components as potential diversity sources. An arable field was sampled weekly on 12 sampling occasions at five sites along a transect line from a drainage ditch with a willow tree belt (hedgerow at field margin) and across the field, which had a terrain depression without water outflow. A spring-time investigation period was chosen when the field depression and the drainage ditch would have been waterlogged. Oribatid abundances at the uncultivated willow hedgerow and the depression were significantly different, not only from the rest of field sites but also from each other. The euryvalent species Oppiella nova, Oppiella obsoleta and Tectocepheus velatus dominated in the arable soils beyond the depression. The community species spectrum at the bottom of the depression, which had considerably higher soil moisture was similar to other field sites but hygro- and halotolerant Oxyoppia europaea, Microppia minus prevailed in this community. Low competitive ability and wide tolerance to environmental changes is probably the reason for the distribution pattern of these species. In the hedgerow a different community was established, with the dominant species Dissorhina ornata, Ramusella insculpta and Hermaniella dolosa being abundant usually in forest and meadow habitats rich in organic matter. Distinct environmental conditions at this site (no cultivation, leaf litter layer on the soil surface) enabled a more diverse oribatid community to establish itself, which was comprised of more specialized (less tolerant) species. We observed a high turnover rate of accidental species in field sites and more stable communities in hedgerow and depression sites. The results document that even small landscape units may serve as important diversity sources (corridors) for restitution of local microarthropod communities in arable fields (alpha-diversity), provided that management practices avoid drastic changes leading to the disturbance and degradation of arable soils.

The present paper attempts to identify the conditions on which ecological landscape plans can be implemented in agricultural practice, considering the prevailing conditions of agricultural policy. The case study was carried out in a local authority area in Saxony (Germany). Calculation of variable margins indicated that most of the measures proposed by the landscape plan (such as planting hedgerows, reduction of land use intensity, establishment of field margins rich in arable weeds) can be realised without loss of farmers' income. That is 6% of the agricultural area can be withdrawn from cultivation without any negative financial effect for the farmers. In addition, a certain proportion of arable fields and grassland can be managed less intensively. Nevertheless, the attitude of farmers towards nature conservation was an obstacle in the realisation of ecological measures, even with generous economic incentives. The method applied was adequate to show that agriculture in this area is dependent on payments from agri-environmental programmes. It is proposed to strengthen the link between such subsidies and more effective agri-environmental measures. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, this taxon has suffered severe declines as a result of agricultural intensification. Conservation efforts largely focus on providing forage resources for bumblebees through the summer, but providing suitable habitat during the period of nest foundation in early spring could be a more effective method of boosting local bumblebee populations. This study assesses the attractiveness of three different farmland habitat types (hedgerow, field margin and grassland), and the relative merits of respective land management prescriptions under the Scottish Rural Stewardship scheme to nest site searching and foraging bumblebee queens during the period of queen emergence and colony foundation. Hedgerows were the least attractive habitat type to spring queens. Rural Stewardship species-rich grassland comprised a complex vegetation structure attracting nest site searching queens, whilst grassland that had been abandoned allowing natural regeneration contained more flowers, attracting foraging queens. Field margin habitats were the most attractive habitat type, and Rural Stewardship field margins attracted both nest site searching and foraging queens at relatively high densities. This management option consisted of a sown grass mix, giving rise to the complex vegetation structure preferred by nest site searching queens, but regular disturbance allowed invasion by early flowering bumblebee forage plants. These findings suggest that it should be possible to develop simple combined management strategies to provide both suitable nesting sites and spring forage resources on farmland, promoting bumblebee colony foundation and therefore abundance in the agricultural environment.

The sampling was done by pitfall traps, placed in a line perpendicular to the shelterbelt. A total of 5962 carabids was caught: Calathus fuscipes was the predominant species. The spatial distribution of breeding types was calculated, showing that autumn breeders were most abundant in the field. The index of diversity was highest in the middle of the shelterbelt, declining significantly with distance from it. The carabids were grouped according to spatial distribution patterns as follows: Group I, species with constant spatial distribution throughout the research period.sbd.species associated with the shelterbelt (e.g., Calathus piceus, Trechus quadristriatus, Notiophilus biguttatus and Carabus nemoralis); species associated with the border of the shelterbelt (e.g., Calathus erratus, Amara bifrons, A. communis and Harpalus rufipes), and species associated with the field (e.g., Amara aenea, A. ovata, and Broscus cephalotes). Group II: Species with variable spatial distribution in relation to the shelterbelt throughout the research period (Calathus fuscipes, Pterostichus melanarius, Calathus melanocephalus and Nebria brevicollis).

Weedy-margin vegetation may harbor pests or pathogens and may also serve as source populations for ongoing immigration of weeds into the field. It is also possible, however, that margin vegetation provides habitat for organisms that consume weed seeds or suppress the likelihood of pest or pathogen outbreak. We examined the nature of margin habitat using spatial-scaling of weed-species richness as an ecological assay. In 2003, we recorded the occurrence of weedy species along the perimeters of 63 fields in Wisconsin. The fields were distributed within six counties that differed in topography, geological history, local climate, and soil type and which spanned the range of variability in the agricultural landscape. We identified seven habitats that differed in geology and land use. The relationship between species richness and margin class was estimated using an analog of the power law. Additionally, we investigated broadscale correlates of habitat heterogeneity at the field level, using a modeling strategy that included additional explanatory factors logically connected to plant diversity. Using a model-confrontation approach, the survey supported the inclusion of two topographical diversity indices, elevation gradient and a field-shape index, into our model. Our broadscale survey provides information on one of a suite of important considerations needed to make decisions about the importance of managing weeds in field margins.","2007","2020-10-29 20:12:33","2021-10-19 13:13:58","","129-136","","","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, a significant negative correlation between activity density and width of the cereal area between the strips was found. Significantly larger numbers of marked Poecilus cupreus and Pterostichus melanarius moved from the control area to the strip-managed area than vice versa.

Significantly higher recapture rates, indicating higher activity, were found in the strip-managed area than in the control area, especially in Poecilus cupreus and also in Carabus granulatus and Pterostichus melanarius. Several observations led to the conclusion that this higher activity is generally due to a prolongation of the reproductive period in the strip-managed area. Significantly higher activity densities were found for P. cupreus, Pterostichus anthracinus, C. granulatus and Pt. melanarius in the strip-managed area than in a bordering control area. P. cupreus is greatly attracted to the strips during its migrations, as can be deduced from the high percentage of movements that contact the strips. Also, significantly more marked individuals moved from the control to the strip-managed area than vice versa. Pt. melanarius and Pt. anthracinus show less preference for the strips in their movements than P. cupreus. However, significantly more individuals of Pt. melanarius also moved from the control to the strip-managed area. C. granulatus, on the other hand, kept mainly to the cereal areas.

Location: Lepsämä River watershed, Nurmijärvi, Southern Finland. Methods: Species diversity indicators included both richness and evenness. Plant communities in buffer strips were surveyed in 29 sampling sites. Using ArcGIS Desktop 9.0 (ArcInfo) and Fragstats 3.3 for GIS analysis, the landscape composition around each sampling site was characterized by seven parameters in square sectors at five scales: 4, 36, 100, 196, and 324ha. For each scale, Principle Component Analysis was used to examine the importance of each structural metric to diversity indicators using multiple regression and other simple analyses. Results: For all but the smallest scales (4 ha), two structural metrics including the diversity of land cover types and percentage of arable land were positively and negatively correlated with species richness, respectively. Both metrics had the highest correlation coefficients for species richness at the second largest scale (196 ha). The density of arable field edges between the fields was the only metric that correlated with species evenness for all scales, which had highest predictive power at the second smallest scale (36 ha). Conclusions: Species richness and evenness of buffer strips had scale-dependent relationships to land use in agricultural ecosystems. The results of this study indicated that species richness depends on the pattern of arable land use at large scales, which may relate to the regional species pool. Meanwhile, species evenness depended on the level of field edge density at small scales, which relates to how the nearby farmland was divided by the edges (e.g. many small-scale fields with high edge density or a few big-scale fields with low edge density). This implies that it is important to manage the biodiversity of buffer strips within a landscape context at multiple scales.

Aims: To investigate the importance of non-cropped habitats for Chaffinch territory distribution, breeding success and foraging habitat selection in Scottish farmland. Methods: Territory distribution, nesting success and foraging behaviour of adults feeding chicks at the nest were recorded and related to habitat composition on two Scottish lowland farms. Results: Higher Chaffinch territory densities were associated with the presence of hedgerows, trees and grass leys, whereas lower densities were found adjacent to winter Barley. Nests were predominantly located in conifer trees and hedgerows. Trees were selected preferentially for foraging. Poor breeding success was detected in nests associated with cereal crops and wider field margins. Farmland in Scotland supported much lower territory densities than in England. Conclusion: Chaffinches rely predominantly on non-cropped habitats for territory establishment, nesting and foraging habitats. Differences in habitat composition between England and Scotland may explain differences in territory densities. However, the Chaffinch's preference for non-crop habitats is unlikely to explain its population trends alone.

This study aimed at determining the importance of riparian strips in agricultural landscapes of southern Quebec for small mammal and herpetofaunal communities, and verifying farmers' general belief that these habitats become shelters for species considered as agricultural pests. Abundance, composition and diversity of communities were compared between three types of riparian strips: herbaceous, shrubby and wooded. A total of 1460 small mammals belonging to 14 species and 329 amphibians and reptiles belonging to 11 species were captured with line trapping and drift fences. The generalist species Sorer cinereus, Zapus hudsonius, Blarina brevicauda, and Bufo americanus were abundant in all three types of riparian strips. Peromyscus maniculatus, Sorex fumeus, Clethrionomys gapperi, and Rana pipiens were associated more closely to wooded strips, whereas Rana sylvatica was captured mostly in shrubby strips. The abundance of small mammals and herpetofauna increased with complexity of vegetation structure. Small mammal diversity was higher in herbaceous and wooded riparian strips, whereas the herpetofaunal community was more diverse in shrubby strips. Proportion and abundance of pest species diminished with complexity of vegetation structure, whereas insectivores increased in abundance. Maintaining woody vegetation in riparian strips should increase abundance and diversity of wildlife within agricultural landscapes where increasing development pressure is presently contributing to the conversion of such habitats to herbaceous strips. Such a management approach should also help reducing the risk of riparian strips becoming shelters for pest species. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Although the water purification effect of riparian ecosystems has been well studied, there is little knowledge of their internal cycling, especially in the area of gaseous emissions. We measured fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), dinitrogen (N-2), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) in riparian grey alder stands in southern Estonia and black alder stands in Brandenburg, Germany. Dinitrogen emission was the most important component in N retention in the studied riparian grey alder forests. In 2001-2003, the median values of N-2 emission in the grey alder sites significantly exceeded the N 2 emission rates in the black alder sites, varying from 700 to 1200 and from 360 to 400 kg N-2-N ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. In contrast, the median values of N2O flux were higher in the black alder sites than in the grey alder sites, i.e., 0.9-2.6 and 0.2-0.7 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. The black alder sites acted as a sink for CH4, whereas the grey alder sites emitted a small amount of CH4. The CO2-C flux was higher in the black alder stands. The estimated N-2-N emission in the grey alder stands for 1994-1995 was 51.2, whereas N2O-N emission was 0.5 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). The significant increase in N-2 emission from 1994-1995 to 2001-2003 can be related to changes in microbial activity during the succession of the pioneer grey alder stand into a more stable mixed forest community. Due to CO2 fluxes and N2O fluxes from sites with altered water regime, the estimated GWP of the studied riparian alder stands was relatively high. Further investigations should concentrate on the factors that regulate rates of N2O and N-2 emission from riparian buffer zones.","2008","2020-10-29 20:12:43","2021-10-19 13:14:03","","231-241","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas N2O emissions were rather small at both sites, average gaseous N2-to-N2O ratios inferred from closed-chamber measurements and He-O laboratory incubations were almost four times smaller for the heavily loaded site.

The objective of this study was to assess the influence of buffer width and vegetation type on the key processes and overall reductions of total suspended solids (TSS), phosphorus (P), and nitrogen (N) from simulated runoff passed through established (7-year old) RBSs. Nine 1-m RBS plots, with three replicates of three vegetation types (all natural selection grasses, two-segment buffer with native grasses and plum shrub, and two-segment buffer with natural selection grasses and plum shrub) and widths ranging from 8.3 to 16.1 m, received simulated runoff having 4,433 mg/l TSS from on-site soil, 1.6 mg/l total P, and 20 mg/l total N. Flow-weighted samples were collected by using Run-off Sampling System (ROSS) units. The buffers were very efficient in removal of sediments, N, and P, with removal efficiencies strongly linked to infiltration. Mass and concentration reductions averaged 99.7% and 97.9% for TSS, 91.8% and 42.9% for total P, and 92.1% and 44.4% for total N. Infiltration alone could account for >75% of TSS removal, >90% of total P removal, and >90% of total N removal. Vegetation type induced significant differences in removal of TSS, total P, and total N. These results demonstrate that adequately designed and implemented grass-shrub buffers with widths of only 8 m provide for water quality improvement, particularly if adequate infiltration is achieved.

In February of 1997 and 1998, bird numbers on field edges and field interiors, with and without field borders, were surveyed using strip transect and line transect methods. Most (93%) birds detected in field edges were sparrows, including Song (Melospiza melodia), Swamp (Melospiza georgiana), Field (Spizella pusilla), Chipping (Spizella passerina). White-throated (Zonotrichia albicollis), and Savannah (Passerculus sandwichensis) sparrows and Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis). We detected more sparrows on farms with field borders than on farms with mowed edges. This difference was most pronounced in field edges where field borders contained 34.5 sparrows/ha and mowed edges contained 12.9 sparrows/ha. Sparrow abundance did not differ by treatment in held interiors. Sparrow density in field borders was intermediate to wintering sparrow densities reported in other studies.

Reichard School of Environmental and Forest Sciences Wooded stream buffers support food production, from fish to farms. While wider buffers of conservation woodlands do improve salmon habitat (Beechie & Sibley 1997), they decrease arable cropland. Riparian buffers do, however, benefit agriculture through erosion control, wind protection and habitat for beneficial species. Some of these beneficial species are termed ""natural enemies,"" as they are the traditional biological control, or predators, of herbivorous crop pests. Many beetles and spiders are prime examples of natural enemies because of their generalist feeding on several families of crop pests (Landis et al. 2000, Landis & Wratten 2002). There is growing support that greater natural enemy diversity correlates to a greater control of crop pests (Lehman & Tilman 2000, Gardiner et al. 2009) Using the Shannon-Wiener diversity index I measured the diversity as well as the abundance of generalist natural enemies moving between fields and riparian buffers at different spatial scales (5', 15', 35', and 180' wide buffers from the stream) during a corn growing season. The 180 foot buffer exhibited significantly greater natural enemy diversity during early corn growth suggesting that larger buffers can provide greater biological control when crops are most susceptible to pest outbreak.","2013","2020-10-29 20:12:46","2020-10-29 20:12:46","","","48","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9781303675454","","","","Agriculture; Ecology; Diversity; Biological sciences; 0329:Ecology; 0473:Agriculture; eppi-reviewer4; Agroecology; 0353:Entomology; Entomology; Biological control; Generalist; Natural enemy; Riparian buffer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to quantify a relative value of ditches for farmland birds depending on the type of surrounding fields. Survey data on farmland bird communities and farmland landscape structure across Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were used. Count plots were situated within either arable fields or grasslands, or their combination and contained two types of ditches, with grassy margins or with tall vegetation such as bushes and trees. Focal species were selected based on their plausible use of ditches. Species richness and abundance of farmland birds were positively associated with the presence of ditches with tall vegetation, but the plausible role of ditches with only grassy margins remained unclear. For some species, the relationship was more pronounced in arable land than in grassland. Regional agricultural policy should support the retention of ditches, especially those with complex structure, in farmland. This action is crucial in landscapes dominated by crop production, as they face the most intense utilisation.","2012","2020-10-29 20:12:47","2020-10-29 20:12:47","","170-181","","","89","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The size-stability distribution in addition to estimating aggregate-size distribution distinguishes between amounts of stable and unstable macroaggregates (>250 mum). The determination of aggregate-size stability distribution involves the assumptions that soil aggregates can be categorized in terms of their size and water stability (slaking resistance). Experimentally this procedure involves the slaked and capillary-wetted pretreatments; and a subsequent slaking treatment of aggregates >250 mum in size. We also propose the stable aggregates index (SAI) and the stable macroaggregates index (SMaI) for studying soil stability based on aggregate resistance to slaking. These indices account for the total weighted average of stable aggregates and the total weighted average of stable macroaggregates, respectively. Both the SAI and the SMaI indices were shown to be sensitive to the effects of vegetation on soil stability under different riparian buffer communities. The SAI and the SMaI indices were higher in surface soils under cool-season grass than any of the other treatments.

Seven field pairs were located in each of small, intermediate and open landscapes, which were based on mean field size. Ground cover, plant species diversity and assemblages were assessed in crop centres, crop edges and non-crop field boundaries. The data were used to test for effects of sown grass margins, differences in field location, impacts on rare weed species and for landscape effects on weed assemblages. Significantly higher plant species diversity was found in boundaries protected by buffer strips. Annual weeds associated with field edges, notably Anisantha sterilis, were found at lower cover where perennial grass strips were present. Sown grass strips enhanced boundary plant diversity, particularly by increasing polycarpic species. Margin strips had a small influence on the weed flora of the crop edge, possibly reducing weed cover, but had no influence on floras of field centres. Field size and landscape context did not affect weed assemblages, which show marked field-to-field variability, though crop type was an important influence. Grass margins did not enhance rare arable weed species and may be a threat to them, if margins are sited where such species are known to occur in the seedbank. With this exception, grass strips are a positive influence on boundary flora diversity and reduce margin weeds in arable landscapes.

A total of 42 fields were investigated, half with at least 3-year-old margin strips created under the UK agri-environment scheme Countryside Stewardship and half nearby control sites. The sites were grouped on the basis of average field size into small, intermediate or open landscape locations to examine landscape structure effects. Assessments of the flora, bird and territory numbers, bees, spiders, Orthoptera and Carabidae were made in early to mid-summer 2003. There were positive impacts on diversity or abundance for the flora, bees and Orthoptera. The herbaceous flora of the pre-existing boundary adjacent to sown 6m strips was significantly more species-rich than controls, probably reflecting a buffer effect of the strip. Bees and Orthoptera, the latter of which were only found in field boundaries, were more abundant where strips were sited, reflecting added habitat resources. Bee numbers were significantly lower in field centres where there were no 6m margin strips. There were no significant effects of sown strips on numbers of birds observed or bird territories, spiders or Carabidae, but also no negative impacts. Lycosid spiders were consistently more abundant in boundaries of small fields with 6m margin strips. Linyphiidae were more abundant within the crop area of smaller fields. Amongst birds, wrens (Troglodytes troglodytes) were also more abundant in small fields, while yellowhammers (Emberiza citrinella) were more abundant in open landscapes. The results confirm there are benefits to farmland biodiversity from introducing new margin strips at the edges of arable fields. More significantly, the success of agri-environment schemes, which will vary between taxa and species, can be dependent on landscape structure. Scheme administrators may need to address landscape structure and mean field size to achieve significant enhancement of populations of declining farmland species.

Primary aims are to develop understanding of the processes governing flood generation and the associated impacts of land management practices, and to bridge the gap between process understanding and ability to predict effects on downstream flooding. To achieve this, the experiment is designed to operate at plot (∼100 m2), hillslope (∼0.1 km2) and small catchment scale (∼10 km2). Hillslope-scale data, from an under-drained, agriculturally 'improved' pasture, show that drain flow is a dominant runoff process. However, depending on antecedent moisture conditions, overland flow may exceed drain flow rates and can be an important contributor to peak flow runoff at the hillslope-scale. Flow, soil tension data and tracer tests confirm the importance of macropores and presence of perched water tables under 'normal' wet conditions. Comparisons of pasture runoff with that from within a 10 year-old tree shelterbelt show significantly reduced overland flow due to the presence of trees and/or absence of sheep. Comparisons of soil hydraulic properties show significant increases in hydraulic conductivity and saturated moisture content of soil under trees compared to adjacent improved pasture.

The destruction of traditionally managed orchards, an important breeding habitat in Central Europe, is a relevant cause. An additional factor for the decline of this species could be the intensified management of the ground vegetation in orchards through reducing food availability and lowering prey detectability and accessibility. In this study we examined the importance of surfaces with sparse vegetation for the location of redstart territories and for foraging. To validate the results of these field studies we made habitat-choice experiments in aviaries with captive birds. Territories occupied by redstarts in orchards of northwestern Switzerland contained a significantly higher proportion of surfaces with sparse vegetation than unoccupied control sites. Redstarts made almost five times more hunting flights into experimentally established ruderal vegetation strips than into adjacent unmown meadows. No difference was observed when the meadow was freshly mown. Vegetation height and the proportion of open ground surface correctly predicted the vegetation type for hunting in 77% of the cases. Experiments in aviaries offering two types of sparse vegetation and a dense meadow supported the results of the field experiments. Even a four-fold increase of the food abundance in the meadow did not lead to a noticeable change in preference for the sparse vegetation types. For the conservation of the common redstart, not only traditionally managed orchards with tall trees with cavities should be preserved but also areas with sparse vegetation should be favored.

We present two orchard experiments where the densities of the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri) were compared depending on: (1) the presence or absence of a windbreak and (2) if the orchards consisted of a solid set re-planting or an orchard with a mixture of mature and reset-replacement trees. Psyllid abundance was measured on the edges of five orchards. The factor investigated was the presence or absence of a windbreak. We observed significantly fewer psyllids on the edges of orchards with windbreaks as compared to those without windbreaks. We found no significant difference in the number of natural enemies between the edges with or without windbreaks, suggesting that windbreaks do not affect densities of psyllid natural enemies. Also, during two consecutive years, we compared the densities of psyllids on young trees less than 3 years of age in a solid set re-planting versus on resets (trees planted in replacement of dead or huanglongbing-infected trees) present randomly within mature orchards. This was conducted in four orchards and among three citrus varieties. More psyllids were found in the solid set re-plantings as compared with on the resets within mature orchards. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that the planting strategy of new trees in orchards may impact the populations of a horticultural pest. Overall our data suggest that establishment and conservation of windbreaks might be beneficial to protect orchards from D. citri. The data also suggest that D. citri populations increase more within uniform landscapes of seedling trees as compared with mature orchards with randomly interspersed young seedlings. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","2015","2020-10-29 20:12:55","2020-10-29 20:12:55","","168-174","","","212","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4; Hedgerows; Citrus greening disease; Conservation biological control; Diaphorina citri; Disease management; Tree removal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two species, skylark Alauda arvensis and yellow wagtail Motacilla flava, established territories within crops. More than half of skylark territories were in autumn-sown cereals, but densities were higher in set-aside and spring-sown crops, while a conservation grassland cut for hay in late July held the highest density. Skylarks did not switch territories in winter cereals for other crops as the breeding season progressed. Weak preferences were found for spring-sown crops and weak avoidance of autumn-sown crops (i.e. there were fewer territories than expected from the area under autumn-sown crops). Skylarks showed preferences for set-aside and conservation grassland but other grassland was avoided. Skylark numbers were negatively associated with hedgerow length within tetrads. Most yellow wagtails nested in spring-sown crops, especially potatoes, for which there was a strong preference; most territories were in the largest fields. More than 75% of territories of turtle dove Streptopelia turtur were associated with residential areas, scrub and woodland, with hedges used much less often than expected from their occurrence. Grass was a strongly preferred land-use. Linnets Carduelis cannabina were mainly located in small areas of scrub and there was an association with winter oil-seed rape. Common whitethroats Sylvia communis showed preferences for hedges, especially for tall hedges, though many territories were situated in field boundaries with only scattered shrubs. Lesser whitethroats S. curruca preferred only tall hedges. Both species had more territories adjacent to grass than expected, with common whitethroat also showing a preference for winter oil-seed rape. Yellowhammers Emberiza citrinella declined over the 3 years of the study. Territories were strongly associated with tall hedges, but preferences for crops were weak. The small number of reed bunting E. schoeniclus territories were almost all by water, with a preference for adjacent grass. Possible mechanisms for reversing the downward trends of bird populations on farmland are discussed.","2000","2020-10-29 20:12:56","2021-10-19 13:14:14","","339-348","","","251","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The early winter distributions of three predatory arthropod taxa, Staphylinidae, Carabidae and Araneae, were studied within a single hedgerow, in relation to a number of biotic and abiotic environmental variables. Vertical distribution patterns were marked and contrasting between taxa, with spiders found predominantly in the shrubby hedge foliage and hedge-base vegetation, carabids in both leaf litter and soil (0-10 cm) and staphylinids in the 0-10 cm soil layer. Hedge orientation and biomass of hedge-base vegetation were implicated as important factors influencing arthropod abundance. Data on individual carabid species showed some differential habitat preferences, as well as differences in the degree of spatial variability. Canonical correspondence analysis of hedge-base carabids showed strong 'field' differences between the two sides of the hedgerow. Soil moisture content and monocotyledon biomass also explained a significant proportion of the observed variation in carabid species composition. These results may reflect differing overwintering site selection between carabid species. The abundance of predatory arthropods was highly variable between micro-sites along the hedgerow, with evidence of overwintering aggregations. This variability has implications for the sampling regimes of both small and larger scale hedgerow studies. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Several published papers demonstrate that integration of shelterbelts with agroecosystems offers positive outcomes, such as better yield, more congenial microclimate, and greater organic matter levels. Nonetheless, soil biological diversity, the driver of greater organic matter levels, has not been convincingly tested and verified yet. In addressing this gap, we measured abundance and diversity of populations of arthropods and fungi in three 11-year old shelterbelts integrated with pasture to determine whether a correlation exists between the abundance of and diversity in populations of arthropods and fungi in two seasons: late autumn-early winter (May-June 2011) and late winter-early spring (August-September 2011). Litter from the soil surface and soil from two depths were sampled at increasing distance from the midpoint of shelterbelts for the extraction of arthropods and isolation culturing of fungi. The relationship among distance, depth and biodiversity of different groups of arthropods and fungi was analysed using linear regression. We found that over both seasons arthropod abundance in the litter and soil declined with increasing distance from the midpoint of the shelterbelts, and with soil depth. However, fungi abundance in either season was not affected by proximity to the shelterbelt but increased with greater soil depth. Distance from the shelterbelt midpoints did not bear an impact on the diversity richness of both arthropods and fungi. Copyright © J. FOR.

This view supports a three-tiered model of variables that determine biotic integrity in streams, with causes and effects flowing from large-scale to fine-scale processes. Tier One characteristics include variables important at the scale of geomorphological processes and land use over entire watersheds. These variables largely determine Tier Two factors, abiotic conditions in a stream reach. Tier Two variables, in turn, largely structure the Tier Three variables, the stream's biotic communities. Through field studies and GIS analysis, relationships among these three tiers of variables were examined in this research to explore the question of how agriculture exerts its influence on stream fishes. This study investigated 27 streams, in two ecoregions and the transition area, or ecotone, between them, in south-central Ohio. The study design allowed questions to be asked concerning the relative influence of geomorphology and land use in varied landscapes, as well as relative impacts of watershed versus riparian land use. The region also contained relatively equal proportions of three types of agriculture (hay, row crops, and pasture) allowing the study to address the question of which land use might be most harmful to stream fish. This study supported the importance of row crop agriculture, finding it to be the most degrading type of agriculture for stream fish, but also found pasture to be an important causal factor in stream community degradation. This study also supported the importance of riparian buffers, finding riparian agriculture to be more degrading than agriculture over the entire watershed. A more interesting finding is the suggestion that a minor amount of nutrient enrichment from agricultural land use may benefit streams that are naturally oligotrophic. A possible mechanism could be increased primary production, which increases macroinvertebrate density, and provides a larger food base for fishes. This study also reports the possible existence of a biodiversity ""hotspot"" in the transitional region between the two ecoregions. Some evidence exists that greater habitat heterogeneity increases species richness, suggesting a possible cause for higher biodiversity in this ecotonal region. Since habitat heterogeneity over whole streams was not measured in this study, both the existence and mechanism of such a hotspot needs more study. A final conclusion is that geomorphology and agricultural land use may be equally important in structuring stream conditions, and thus, biological stream communities. This study illustrates the difficulties associated with overlapping causes and effects in complex systems such as streams and their catchments. Several variables in the study reported here required examination at multiple scales and with multiple statistical techniques in order to understand relationships that varied across different regions. The effects of a particular agricultural variable were not always equal in the diverse landscapes of southern Ohio. Lotic ecologists must examine a variety of ecoregions, and incorporate a variety of scales with a variety of analytic tools, if predictive stream ecology is to become a reality.","2004","2020-10-29 20:12:58","2020-10-29 20:12:58","","","175-175 p.","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9780496848409; 049684840X","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) has investigated whether fencing off the margins of such fields next to watercourses to control diffuse pollution has any positive impacts on biodiversity, based on assessments of vegetation composition and condition and structure of assemblages of invertebrates of importance as foodstuffs to farmland birds. Fencing watercourses increased the abundance of key groups of invertebrates. However, the invertebrate species diversity was not increased unless the margins were >= 5.4 m in width. Margins established in the study area to prevent access by livestock to watercourses or to enhance biodiversity are generally <= 2.6 m wide and are therefore unlikely to provide conditions for additional invertebrate species to use. The dense, tall swards within such margins are also unlikely to provide foraging opportunities for farmland birds. Management (such as low-intensity grazing by livestock in the margins) is essential to provide the conditions required for these groups, but this could conflict with the diffuse pollution mitigation aims. A compromise is proposed whereby limited autumn/winter grazing by livestock could be used to open the vegetation structure in the margins. Grazing by livestock at that time may be acceptable since it is not occurring in the period of main diffuse pollution concern (i.e., the fecal contamination of watercourses and bathing waters in the spring and summer). It is also essential that a landscape-scale approach is taken, driven by knowledge of the full needs of the species concerned, when deciding where best to target agri-environmental actions aimed at farmland bird conservation.","2012","2020-10-29 20:12:59","2021-10-19 13:14:09","","355-363","","","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study tested the hypothesis that the absence or presence of shelter belts (one or two) in paddocks decreases fence-line pacing and associated soil and water quality impacts. Soils near the fence line and in the rest of the paddock, in paddocks containing zero, one or two shelter belts, were sampled for bulk density and macroporosity (pores > 30 mu m diameter). Large intact samples (1 x 0.2 x 0.1 m(3)) were used to generate overland flow via rainfall simulation. The flow was tested for nutrients [phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) fractions], suspended sediment (SS), and the faecal indicator bacteria, Escherichia coli. Results showed that bulk density, void volume, SS, particulate P and total P were affected by location (fence line or rest of paddock) but, along with all other measurements except E. coli, were not affected by the number of shelter belts. Thus, the inclusion of shelter had no effect on the concentration of contaminant lost in overland flow or any soil physical or hydrological parameter, but decreased the run-off of E. coli. The lack of contrast between the location of soils can be partly attributed to the soil type (Brown, NZ soil classification, USDA Taxonomy: Typic Fragiudalf), which when compared with past studies was less erosive and lost less P into solution. Other factors may have been different management or the lesser impact of weaners compared with older hinds and stags on soil properties. Although only E. coli concentrations were decreased by the inclusion of shelter, factors such as improved production and animal welfare weigh heavily in favour of installing and maintaining shelter on deer farms. However, the environmental benefit of shelter should be tested in other farms where factors such as slope, soil, climate and farm management may increase the contrast with no shelter.","2006","2020-10-29 20:12:59","2021-10-19 13:13:49","","158-164","","","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

FBEGS surveys were also carried out on field boundaries to assess ecological quality. GLMs were fitted to assess the utility of the FBEGS Index as a predictor of bird populations. Results The FBEGS Index was an effective predictor of bird populations in the breeding season, but had limited use in predicting bird populations in winter. Within the overall FBEGS Index, the Associated Features score was a good predictor for populations in both the winter and breeding seasons.

Four replicate margins on arable land each contained five treatment plots 72 m long by 6 m wide. The treatments were: (1) cropped to the edge; (2) sown 'tussocky' grass mix; (3) sown 'grass and wildflower' mix; (4) Split margin (3 in 'tussocky' grass adjacent to hedge and 3 m 'grass and wildflower' next to crop); and (5) natural regeneration. Invertebrates were sampled by pitfall trapping, sweep netting, and butterfly and bumblebee transects, and identified to species level. The use of different flower species by foraging bumblebees was also examined. Despite all treatments containing a flush of annual weeds early in the establishment year, the five margin types were distinct in their vegetation composition by their first mid-summer. Where statistically significant results were obtained for invertebrates, avoidance of the 'cropped' treatment was by far the commonest observed response. This tendency could be clearly demonstrated amongst the carabids, spiders, butterflies, bumblebees, millipedes and harvestmen, with margins often containing double or more the number of invertebrates of similar areas cropped to the edge. Having avoided the crop, preferences for other margin types were mixed, but there was a marked tendency by many nectar and/or pollen-feeding, flying insects towards greater abundance on those margins containing sown 'wildflowers' (e.g. butterflies Meadow Brown and Ringlet, Bumblebees, Pollen Beetle Meligethes sp.) or flowers either sown or unsown (Soldier Beetle Rhagonycha fulva). There was a less strong tendency for predatory species occurring in the vegetation canopy and depending on small, especially flying insects for food, to also prefer the flowery treatments (e.g. total spiders caught by sweeping, seven-spot ladybird). Harvestmen in autumn reject natural regeneration in favour of any sown treatment. Only one species, the carabid Nebria brevicollis, was trapped in higher numbers in the cropped treatment than on any sown margin, and then only in autumn. Of the six common bumblebee species, the two longest-tongued species showed different patterns of flower visitation from the remaining four. These results clearly demonstrate that sown field margins can rapidly produce substantial biodiversity benefits oil arable land, with the resulting fauna influenced by the type of field margin created.

Of these, we show that wide field margins positively affected abundances, although species did not all respond in the same way. We demonstrate that this variation can be attributed to species-specific mobility characteristics. Those species for which the effect of wide margins was strongest covered shorter distances, and were more frequently recaptured at their site of first capture. This demonstrates that the standard, field-scale uptake of AES may be effective only for less mobile species. We discuss that a landscape-scale approach, in contrast, could deliver significant biodiversity gains, as our results indicate that such an approach (perhaps delivered through targeting farmers to join AES) would be effective for the majority of wider countryside species, irrespective of their mobility level. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Species belonged to either the grass/herb- or shrub/tree-feeders' guild. Margin width did not affect the number of individuals, in either guild. Numbers of shrub/tree-feeding individuals were higher at sites with hedgerow trees, but not so for this guild's two most mobile species, nor for the grass/herb-feeders, which were 30% more mobile. The results show that hedgerow trees increase adult moth numbers because they are shelter-providing resources in typically exposed agricultural landscapes, rather than due to being larval food resources.

We tested whether AES options aimed at increasing general biodiversity also benefit a highly endangered moth, Poliabombycina, without species-specific tailoring. We assessed effects on its abundance of two AES options, wide field margins and hedgerow trees, using light traps at the landscape-scale and for mark-release-recapture at the farm-scale. We hypothesized that abundance would be highest at wide field margins and at hedgerow trees, and that if hedgerow trees conferred a positive effect, individuals would be more likely to follow hedgerows than crossing exposed fields while on the move. The results showed that significantly more individuals were captured at sites with a hedgerow tree. Numbers were also higher at wide margins, but this was not statistically significant, and no individuals were caught at field centres. Our study suggests that general options within appropriately designed and implemented AES aimed at increasing overall biodiversity in intensive agricultural landscapes have the potential to not only benefit common, widespread habitat generalists, but some rare and more endangered species as well. P. bombycina serves as an example of how general AES options, existing and novel ones alike, might cater for the needs of rare and localised species. As the precise ecological requirements of most invertebrate species remain unknown, we urge scientists and governments to address the challenge to research and design truly general AES, which options should be able to deliver not only for widespread species but also for the less-widespread counterpart of farmland biodiversity. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","2010","2020-10-29 20:13:06","2021-10-19 13:14:05","","499-510","","","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, the effects of two features of lowland agricultural landscapes on the abundance and diversity of larger moths are contrasted. Although both features bring about positive effects, hedgerow trees have a larger impact than 6 m wide grassy field margins. Whilst AES payments are given to create and maintain grass margins, no financial reward is currently offered for the retention of hedgerow trees. Furthermore, it was only in areas where the amount of land under AES was experimentally increased, by targeting farmers, that the presence of hedgerow trees resulted in a substantially higher abundance (+60%) and diversity (+38%) of moths. Thus, by using larger moths as bio-indicators of landscape-scale quality, it is demonstrated that improvements to the cost-effectiveness of AES could be achieved, firstly, by providing more appropriate financial rewards to farmers for different landscape features, and secondly, through landscape-scale targeting of farmers to encourage participation in AES. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Crucial to achieving this is identifying management options that are practical and beneficial to biodiversity, and understanding the influence of the surrounding landscape. We used data on abundance and species richness of farmland macro-moths, many of which are declining, and trait-based analyses on their feeding guild, mobility and conservation status, to explore local- and landscape-scale effects of two farmland features (extended-width field margins and hedgerow trees) and surrounding farmland intensification., Macro-moths were light trapped at 48 fixed sites on 16 farms, over 4 years, within a 1200-km2 area of lowland UK farmland. Sites belonged to one of four experimental groups that differed in their combinations of hedgerow tree presence and field margin width., Hedgerow trees and extended-width field margins locally increased species richness, but not abundance, of macro-moths, irrespective of each other's presence. Overall, species richness and abundance were not affected by agricultural intensification, as measured by the amount of arable land in the surrounding landscape., Sedentary moths showed double the species richness, but were half as abundant as mobile moths. Both groups responded positively to extended-width margin and hedgerow tree presence. The effect of hedgerow trees was particularly strong for shrub- and/or tree-feeding species., Analyses based on the conservation status of moths demonstrated that agricultural intensification lowered the species richness of nationally severely declining UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species and the abundance of both nationally moderately declining and priority species. These effects were most pronounced at the 0·8-km radius scale., Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the presence of extended-width field margins and hedgerow trees, possibly promoted by agri-environment schemes targeting their implementation at relatively small spatial scales (0·8 km), may help mitigate negative effects of agricultural intensification on macro-moths. A wide range of other taxa feed on macro-moths and may therefore indirectly benefit from these features. Nevertheless, taxa differ widely in their mobility and measures mitigating biodiversity loss may need to be targeted at multiple spatial scales to maximize their effectiveness for multiple taxa.

The most abundant breeding species were Golden Oriole Oriolus oriolus and Greenfinch Carduelis chloris, with overall linear densities of 2.9 and 2.6 pairs/km, respectively. Overall linear densities of a further four species (Red-backed Shrike Lanius collurio, Syrian Woodpecker Dendrocopos syriacus, Whitethroat Sylvia communis and Cuckoo Cuculus canorus) exceeded 1 pair/ km. The densities of breeding birds are compared to those obtained during other studies in Europe and elsewhere.","2010","2020-10-29 20:13:08","2020-10-29 20:13:08","","7-13","","","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the ability to reduce nitrate has been variable and does not always work as effectively as desired. Defining ideal buffer placements that maximize denitrification could protect more stream miles, improving overall water quality. Over the past five years a detailed evaluation of the hydrology and attenuation of groundwater nitrate was conducted on two buffer sections along the same stream enrolled In the North Carolina Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program. These sections had two distinct widths and topographic locations. The objective of the study was to compare the differences between these buffer sections and provide a clear illustration of the necessity of preliminary evaluations prior to buffer installation. The average buffer widths were 60 m (Section 1, upstream) and 45 m (Section 2, downstream). Three transects of groundwater monitoring well nests with shallow (1.5-2.3 m) and deep (2.7-3.6 m) depths were installed within each buffer zone. Groundwater nitrate levels significantly decreased through the buffer sections (α=0.05). Water table measurements, nitrate to chloride ratios, deep well water quality analyses, topography, and redox measurements indicated denitrification as the predominant nitrate reduction mechanism and both sections were suitable for denitrification to proceed at high rates. However, groundwater contributing areas significantly influenced the overall efficiency of nitrate reduction in Section 1 due to nitrate limitations (α=0.05). Findings from this project provide an advanced understanding of factors that could lead to design recommendations that will enhance pollutant reductions in riparian buffers.","2011","2020-10-29 20:13:08","2020-10-29 20:13:08","","3904-3922","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers Annual International Meeting 2011, ASABE 2011","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Isolates were sampled from cultivated field and hedgerow soils, from insects harbouring latent fungal infections, and from the phylloplanes of three plant species common in the hedgerow flora. A nuclear phylogeny of this local Beauveria assemblage resolved seven phylogenetic species, including (i) five phylogenetic species within Beauveria bassiana sensu stricto; (ii) Clade C, a taxonomically uncharacterized species that is morphologically indistinguishable but phylogenetically distant from B. bassiana s.s.; and (iii) Beauveria brongniartii. All seven species were present throughout the hedgerow habitat, including as infections in insects. Significantly, only B. bassiana s.s. phylogenetic species Eu_1 was isolated from tilled soils. Mating type polymerase chain reaction assays demonstrated that all five B. bassiana s.s. phylogenetic species possess bipolar outcrossing mating systems. Of these, only the Eu_1 population contained two mating types; however, a 31:2 skew in MAT1:MAT2 mating types suggests a low frequency of sexual reproduction in this population. The four remaining B. bassiana s.s. phylogenetic species were fixed for single mating types and these populations are evidently clonal.

Direct fluorescent antibody analysis was used to quantitate cysts in 350 storm runoff samples. G. duodenalis was detected on all five dairy farms, with fluxes of 1 to 14,000 cysts/liter observed in 16% of samples. Cysts were detected in 41% of runoff samples collected near cattle less than 2 months old, compared to 10% of runoff samples collected near cattle over 6 months old. Furthermore, the concentrations and instantaneous loads of cysts were ≥65 and ≥79 times greater, respectively, in runoff from sites housing young calves than in sites housing other age classes of animals. Factors associated with environmental loading of G. duodenalis included cattle age, cattle stocking number, and precipitation but not lot area, land slope, or cattle density. Vegetated buffer strips were found to significantly reduce waterborne cysts in storm runoff: each additional meter of vegetated buffer placed below high-cattle-use areas was associated with reductions in the concentration and instantaneous load of cysts by factors of 0.86 and 0.79 (-0.07 and -0.10 log10/m), respectively. Straw mulch, seed application, scraping of manure, and cattle exclusion did not significantly affect the concentration or load of G. duodenalis cysts. The study findings suggest that vegetated buffer strips, especially when placed near dairy calf areas, should help reduce the environmental loading of these fecal protozoa discharging from dairy farms.

Each site type was sampled twice in 2013, once during the reproductive period and once during the migratory period. Each sample consisted of at least eight nights of ultra-sound recordings. Bat species were separated into three groups: Pipistrellus sp., Eptesicus-Nyctalus sp. and Plecotus-Myotis sp.

The current losses in honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Apidae)) colonies pose a serious threat to the blueberry industry, raising interest in alternative pollinators. Abundance and diversity of native pollinators usually decreases with distance from natural habitats. In this study, we evaluated the effects of distance from wooded habitats such as windbreaks and forest borders on the presence of native pollinators in blueberry fields in Lac-St-Jean (Quebec, Canada). Four treatments were compared: single-row, double-row, natural windbreaks, and forest borders. Pan-traps were placed at 5, 30, and 60 m from the windbreak or forest border. A total of 3878 native pollinators were collected and 81% were ground-nesting bees. The forest border was the only treatment with higher abundance and species richness on the periphery (5 m) of the field than at further distances, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of pollinators is favoured by habitats potentially offering more abundant and diverse nutritional resources. Our overall results reveal that native pollinators are distributed quite homogeneously in blueberry fields, suggesting that windbreaks are beneficial to native pollinator communities.","2015","2020-10-29 20:13:12","2021-10-19 13:14:17","","432-442","","","147","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to study the deposition processes in a riparian forest located in the county of Iracemapolis state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, soil samples were collected on a transect for micromorphological as well as particle size distribution analyses, using Folk & Ward statistical parameters. Soil samples were dispersed with NaOH + sodium hexametaphosphate and water. The dispersion in water was made to simulate field transport conditions. Particle size distributions together with field and laboratory morphological analyses showed an irregular and non- uniform sediment deposition. This deposition process suggests the occurrence of high intensity erosive events that produce high amount of sediments and runoff characterized by a turbulent flow. The land use change in the riparian area marks the change in the preferential deposition location, which when sugar- cane dominated, corresponded to the alluvial plain and, after the restoration and development of the riparian forest, was dislocated 27 m upslope within the first few meters from the border of the forest.","2007","2020-10-29 20:13:13","2021-10-19 13:14:39","","486-494","","","64","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Botanical diversity in 117 hedge-bottoms on two neighbouring farms in Yatesbury, Wiltshire, UK, were studied in relation to boundary structure, hedge management practices and adjacent features on the farm to which they belong. The farms differed with regard to field margin and hedge management practices, but soil type and cropping patterns were very similar. Attention was also paid to effects of sown grass strips, coppicing and gapping-up of hedges and different approaches towards field margin management. Results indicated that there were no significant differences in woody species richness between the two farms, with hedges of similar composition. There was significantly higher herbaceous species diversity on the farm with grass strips. Multivariate analyses indicated that community differences were present, with a number of annual and biennial plant species predominating on the farm without grass margins. Principal components analysis (PCA), redundancy analysis (RDA) with forward selection and associated Monte-Carlo permutation tests, and stepwise linear regression showed the following. (1) Sown grass and/or wildflower strips adjacent to the hedge-bottom have a positive effect on species richness of the hedge-bottom vegetation. They also reduce the abundance in the hedge-bottom of Anisantha sterilis, Galium aparine, Poa trivialis and Urtica dioica, all four considered to be pernicious weed species. (2) Coppicing, in combination with gapping-up of hedges increases species richness of the hedge-bottom vegetation and has a positive effect on floral diversity in the landscape. (3) Diversity in management, boundary structure and adjacent features within one farm increases the floral diversity at the farm scale.

However, buffer system efficacy in pesticide runoff mitigation varies widely due to a multitude of factors including, but not limited to, pesticide chemistry, vegetation composition, and hydrology. Two experimental systems, a control (no vegetation) and a grass-wetland buffer system, were evaluated for their ability to retain diazinon and permethrin associated with a simulated storm runoff. The two systems were equally inefficient at retaining diazinon (mean 9.6 % retention for control and buffer). Grass-wetland buffers retained 83 % and 85 % of cis- and trans-permethrin masses, respectively, while the control only retained 39 % and 44 % of cis- and trans-permethrin masses, respectively. Half-distances (the distance required to decrease pesticide concentration by one-half) for both permethrin isomers were 26 %-30 % shorter in grass buffers (22-23 m) than in the control (32 m). The current study demonstrates treatment efficacy was a function of pesticide properties with the more strongly sorbing permethrin retained to a greater degree. The study also demonstrates challenges in remediating multiple pesticides with a single management practice. By using suites of management practices, especially those employing vegetation, better mitigation of pesticide impacts may be accomplished.","2014","2020-10-29 20:13:15","2020-10-29 20:13:15","","574-579","","","93","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Planted borders that contain mixes of prairie flowers and grasses are designed to harbor more diverse arthropod communities, but the relative value of these borders as brood habitat is unknown. We used groups of six human-imprinted northern bobwhite chicks as a bioassay for comparing four different border treatments (planted native grass and prairie flowers, planted prairie flowers only, fallow vegetation, or mowed vegetation) as northern bobwhite brood habitat from June-August 2009 and 2010. All field border treatments were established around nine organic crop fields. Groups of chicks were led through borders for 30-min foraging trials and immediately euthanized, and eaten arthropods in crops and gizzards were measured to calculate a foraging rate for each border treatment. We estimated arthropod prey availability within each border treatment using a modified blower-vac to sample arthropods at the vegetation strata where chicks foraged. Foraging rate did not differ among border treatments in 2009 or 2010. Total arthropod prey densities calculated from blower-vac samples did not differ among border treatments in 2009 or 2010.

However, traditional fallow field borders lack nectar sources required to sustain beneficial insect communities, and their value to small mammals is not well-understood. In October-November 2009, we trapped small mammals in four field-border treatments (planted native, warm-season grasses and prairie flowers, planted prairie flowers only, fallow vegetation, and frequently mowed vegetation) replicated around nine organic crop fields, and developed closed-population models in Program MARK to estimate abundance in each border. We also measured vegetation cover within each border treatment from June to August 2009. We captured 491 individuals of two species, the hispid cotton rat ( Sigmodon hispidus) and house mouse ( Mus musculus). Cotton rat abundance was ≥2 times greater in grass and flower borders and flowers-only borders than in fallow borders, likely because of greater vegetation density and availability of preferred foods in planted borders. No cotton rats were captured in mowed borders, and house mouse abundance was ≥5 times lower in mowed borders than in other border types. Lower abundance of cotton rats and house mice in mowed borders emphasizes the importance of structurally complex non-crop vegetation for supporting small-mammal communities in agricultural landscapes. Field borders planted to promote beneficial insects may be a useful tool for maximizing the ecological services provided by non-crop vegetation. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.

They also highlight the importance of the presence of a network of wooded elements connecting the maternity roost with the foraging areas. To assure long-term protection of this colony, strong habitat conservation measures should be taken in a radius of up to 1-2 km around the roost.","2002","2020-10-29 20:13:19","2021-10-19 13:13:42","","49-54","","","132","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Models can help simulate the field conditions and predict the buffer effectiveness. A single event model for simulating the hydrology and sediment filtration in buffer strips is developed and field tested. Input parameters, sensitivity analysis, calibration and field testing of the model are presented, The model was developed by linking three submodels to describe the principal mechanisms found in natural buffers: a Petrov-Galerkin finite element kinematic wave overland flow submodel, a modified Green-Ampt infiltration submodel and the University of Kentucky sediment filtration model for grass areas. The new formulation effectively handles complex sets of inputs similar to those found in natural events. Major outputs of the model are water outflow and sediment trapping on the strip. The strength of the model is a good description of the hydrology within the filter area, which is essential for achieving good sediment outflow predictions or trapping efficiency. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the most sensitive parameters for the hydrology component are initial soil water content and vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity, and sediment characteristics (particle size, fall velocity and sediment density) and grass spacing for the sediment component. A set of 27 natural runoff events (rainfall amounts from 0.003 to 0.03 m) from a North Carolina Piedmont site was used to test the hydrology component, and a subset of nine events for the sediment component. Good predictions are obtained with the model if shallow uniform sheet flow (no channelization) occurs within the filter.

Typically, no nutrients or pesticides are applied in these margins, which may be sown either with a crop or with grasses and native flowering plants. In some cases the margins are mown, while in others they are left alone. Newly established grass margins are less species-rich than held boundaries or road verges with a long history, justifying the expectation that field margins, if properly managed and given time and appropriate seed sources, could develop into relatively species-rich vegetation. We studied the biodiversity of both margins taken out of production and adjacent ditch banks in the years following initial establishment of the margins. To this end we combined the data of three different projects in order to increase the sensitivity of the statistical analyses. The results showed that the plant species richness of the field margins increased in the years following establishment over a period of four years. In addition, shifts in species composition indicated a decrease in soil nitrate concentrations. The species richness of both butterflies and dragonflies may increase. The most striking result was the marked increase in the plant species richness of the adjacent ditch banks in the five years following creation of the margins. Here, too, changes in species composition indicated a decrease in soil nitrate. in the years following establishment of the field margins there was no increase in the cover of agriculturally harmful weeds in these margins. However, the number of harmful nematodes increased. Our results show the short term effect of establishing field margins. Long term effects are still in need for further research.

The air velocity is also characterized by considerable temporal and spatial variability, including the occurrence of extreme values, even within a relatively short episodes and local scale. Detailed measurements of wind field demonstrate this heterogeneity. The paper presents results of the relationship between wind speed on the windward and leeward side of windbreaks in a few episodes with distinct heterogeneity of air velocity.

The main aim of the study was to test whether organic farming enhances local plant species richness in both crop and noncrop areas of vineyard farms located in intensive conventional landscapes. Nine conventional and nine organic farms were selected in an intensively cultivated region (i.e. no gradient in landscape composition) in northern Italy. In each farm, vascular plants were sampled in one vineyard and in two non-crop linear habitats, grass strips and hedgerows, adjacent to vineyards and therefore potentially influenced by farming. We used linear mixed models to test the effect of farming, and species longevity (annual vs. perennial) separately for the three habitat types. In our intensive agricultural landscapes organic farming promoted local plant species richness in vineyard fields, and grassland strips while we found no effect for linear hedgerows. Differences in species richness were not associated to differences in species composition, indicating that similar plant communities were hosted in vineyard farms independently of the management type. This negative effect of conventional farming was probably due to the use of herbicides, while mechanical operations and mowing regime did not differ between organic and conventional farms. In grassland strips, and only marginally in vineyards, we found that the positive effect of organic farming was more pronounced for perennial than annual species. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","2012","2020-10-29 20:13:23","2021-10-19 13:14:34","","1054-1060","","","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluate three ways of potentially promoting predator numbers: providing conservation strips adjacent to farmland, reducing the number of deleterious chemical sprays and changing tillage practices. In providing growers with management guidelines we also introduce a simple insecticide metric, based on IOBC toxicity ratings, and application number, to assess the biological impacts of agro-chemical usage. Sampling across 20 western Victorian properties, along transects from adjacent remnant grasslands 200 m into arable fields, was seasonally (February and March) biased to the dominant carabid species. Effects of remnant grassland or crop varied among properties, but overall there was a greater abundance of the carabid Notonomus gravis in remnant grasslands, with a reduction in populations as the distance increased into the field. Ordination analyses indicated structure in the predator communities, both in the field and remnant environments, correlated to field chemical use, and tillage. This study demonstrates that beneficial species respond to changes in agronomic practices (e.g. tillage, insecticide) and growers can augment ecosystem services provided by maintaining diverse environments.

Lack of sound information on and funding for establishing and managing trees in SMZs is hindering wide-scale adoption of this practice. Australian Codes of Forest Practice discourage or prevent harvesting of trees in SMZs of perennial streams. One concern is the potential effect of tree harvesting in SMZs on delivery of sediment to adjacent streams. The aims of this paper were to summarize the literature relevant to this concern and, in one case study in an agricultural context, to determine the effects on turbidity of harvesting a SMZ plantation. Information was sourced from published studies that reported on impacts of tree harvesting inside SMZs. In addition, a study was conducted in Tasmania, Australia, to evaluate the water quality benefits of a SMZ and the effects of tree harvesting in this zone. This case study consisted of a 20-year-old Eucalyptus nitens pulpwood plantation in a SMZ of an intermittent stream that was harvested according to the state Code of Forest Practice. A machinery exclusion zone immediately adjacent to the stream limited machinery traffic. Ground cover and water quality pre- and postharvesting were measured to identify the major sources of sediment in this headwater catchment, and to determine the effect of tree harvesting. Literature indicates that tree harvesting in SMZs is an accepted practice in the USA, New Zealand, and Germany, if conducted carefully, i.e., using best management practices (BMPs). Negative effects of this practice on water quality, in- and near-stream habitat, and biodiversity have been recorded, but these effects were generally minor or transitory. Tree harvesting in the Tasmanian study resulted in minimal mineral soil exposure and increased surface roughness. Postharvesting turbidity levels in streamflow were similar to preharvest levels (< 2.5 nephelometric turbidity units exiting the catchment). Much more significant sources of sediment were a road, a dam that was accessible to cattle, and a cultivated paddock. These sources led to turbidities of c. 300 NTUs in a dam immediately below these points and above the harvested stream reach during a storm in late June 2009. In-stream dams, installed many years earlier to store water for stock and irrigation, acted as very effective sediment traps. The SMZs and other BMPs used in agroforestry landscapes are effective at protecting water quality. Forest harvesting operations can be conducted in SMZs without increasing stream turbidity, if existing BMPs are followed.","2010","2020-10-29 20:13:25","2020-10-29 20:13:25","","652-670","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I predicted that warm season grasses would provide favorable habitat for more diverse and abundant arthropod populations, particularly natural enemies. The weight of evidence did not support my prediction and suggests that cool season grass buffers provide equivalent, if not better habitat for arthropods than warm season grasses.

The species number and density of most predator groups increased from year to year. The succession (parallel to the development of the unmown strips) favoured more specialized species, so that the initial pioneer species become less abundant in consecutive years. In spiders, this succession leads from a dominance of Linyphiidae to a dominance of Lycosidae; the spider biomass increases and probably predator pressure by spiders is augmented. The stability of the predator community (measured as the variance of their frequency in successive years) is higher than that of the phytophagous groups. Under strip-managed conditions the abundance (""activity density"") of most arthropod groups decreases by an average of ca. 12%. The trophic levels, however, are affected to different extents and strong species-specific preferences were found as well. These combined effects lead to constant increase in the ratio of predacious and parasitic to phytophagous insects in the strip-managed area and probably lead also to an increase of the predator pressure facing phytophagous insects.

We used multiple regression and Akaike's Information Criteria to determine how habitat width and several landscape-level factors (i.e., landscape composition [total herbaceous cover, amount of developed area, and amount of wooded cover] and configuration [herbaceous edge density]) influenced the abundance and diversity of the butterfly community using filter strips in southwestern Minnesota, USA. Habitat-sensitive butterfly abundance and all richness and diversity measures were positively correlated with filter-strip width. Butterfly abundance was negatively associated with the amount of developed areas (cities, towns, and roads) within the area of a 1-km radius ($3.14 km^2$) surrounding the sites. Percentage of wooded cover in the landscape was an important variable explaining individual species abundance, although the direction of the relationship varied.

Our goal was to identify variables that can explain the variation of earthworm communities across Finnish arable fields by focusing on both regional aspects, such as climate and inherent soil properties, and local aspects, such as field management practices and field margins. We sampled the earthworms during the autumn of 2004 and 2005 at 53 sites of cultivated fields and margins, distributed to 11 localities ranging from the southern parts of Finland to the Arctic Circle. Simultaneously, information was collected on topsoil properties, cultivation history, and climatic factors. We found that soil type was by far the best regional variable to explain the variation in total earthworm density, the density being highest in medium coarse soils, i.e., silts and very fine sands. However, soil type had a significant interaction with soil C:N ratio. After accounting for the effect of soil type, no clear geographical trends remained in the regional variation, except that coastal areas with thin snow cover and deep frost had lower earthworm density than inland areas with deep snow cover and shallow frost. Of the local variables, tillage frequency, grazing, and field margins were the most influential. Frequent tillage led to earthworm communities heavily dominated by endogeic species, while grazed pastures had more than three times the earthworm biomass in comparison to non-grazed fields. Field margins harbored over twice the density and almost double the number of species in comparison to the adjacent cultivated fields, and eight of the nine species had wider regional distribution in the margins than in the fields. Inside the fields, species richness tended to decrease gradually with increasing distance to the margin. Our results suggest that, while soil texture and climatic factors set the general limits to earthworm communities in Finnish arable soils, field management practices can override these limits at the local scale. Cultivation in general simplifies the earthworm community, and this is particularly clear in the fields that are frequently tilled, whereas pastures and field margins seem to effectively preserve the biomass and diversity of earthworms.","2011","2020-10-29 20:13:29","2021-10-19 13:14:21","","3162-3177","","","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the relative reduction of N load or concentration (BS eff ectiveness, BSE), varies with management and local conditions, especially hydrogeology. We present novel experimental evidence on BSE for 5-m-wide grass BS on intensively drained and managed plain agricultural lowland with varying hydrogeology. We selected characteristic sites for fi ve major hydrogeological classes of the Netherlands and installed paired 5-m-wide unfertilized grass (BS) and reference (REF) treatments along the ditch. Th e REF was managed like the adjacent fi eld, and BS was only harvested. Treatments were equipped with reservoirs in the ditch to collect and measure discharge and fl ow proportional N concentration for 3 or 4 yr. In addition, N concentration in upper groundwater was measured. We found a statistically signifi cant BSE of 10% on the peat site. At the other sites, BSE for N was low and statistically insignifi cant. Low BSE was explained by denitrifi cation between adjacent fi eld and ditch, as well as by the site-specifi c hydrologic factors including low proportion of shallow groundwater fl ow, downward seepage, low residence time in the BS, and surface runoff away from the ditch.

However, the experimental evidence on their effectiveness (BSE) has been from sloping locations with shallow flow and surface runoff. The aim of this experimental study was to quantify BSE for P on flat agricultural lowland, predominantly with deep flow. We selected sites characteristic of five major hydrogeological classes in the Netherlands and in each experimental field installed paired 5-m-wide unfertilized grass (BS) and reference treatments (REF) that abutted the ditch. The REF treatments were managed similar to the adjacent grass or maize field, but BS treatments were only harvested. Each treatment had a reservoir in the ditch to collect and measure discharge and flow-proportional P concentration for 3 or 4yr. We also measured net P withdrawal, the P status of the soil and P concentration in upper groundwater. We found a significant BSE for P of 61% on the site with the shallowest flow and steepest slope (2%). At the other sites, BSE was low and statistically insignificant. We conclude that harvested unfertilized buffer strips reduce P loads from flat fields only in specific areas with high surface runoff and/or shallow flow, especially in combination with a high original soil P status.","2013","2020-10-29 20:13:30","2021-10-19 13:13:46","","162-174","","","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite their wide application, though, there has been scarcely any long-term monitoring of the succession of invertebrates. In the field margins of 40 farms, invertebrate diversity and the abundance of three functional groups were assessed in relation to age. The diversity in terms of number of species groups was found to increase with the age of the margins. The abundance of herbivores and detritivores also showed a positive correlation with the age of the margins. However, the abundance of predators decreased with increasing age. Older margins showed a higher total vegetation cover and fewer plant species, also resulting in lower plant species evenness. We suggest several changes to the current AES regulations. For the conservation of invertebrate diversity, longer-lasting field margins are desirable. In addition, old margins are favoured by detritivores, a group that has particular difficulty finding suitable habitats in agricultural landscapes. However, such margins are less favourable from an agricultural perspective, as they appear unsuitable for high abundances of potentially useful predators and the high vegetation cover attracts many potentially harmful herbivores. To circumvent this, the AES might be extended by incorporating hay-making, which would reduce standing biomass and might lead to more predators and fewer herbivores.","2010","2020-10-29 20:13:32","2021-10-19 13:14:18","","3255-3268","","","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two of the shelterbelts in question were of the single-row type. The remaining two consisted of at least two rows of deciduous trees and in both cases some conifers. Wind measurements were made under various weather conditions, both in winter and in summer. The minimum relative wind speed on the lee side varied from ca 0.1 behind the most dense shelterbelt to 0.4 behind the most porous one when the wind was blowing at right angles in summer. In the winter, the shelter effect was much less than in the summer but the two most dense shelterbelts did reduce the wind speed considerably also then. When the wind was blowing at an angle to the shelterbelt, the lee maximum occurred closer to the belt and the wind speed recovered faster than when it blew at right angles. The wind reduction just behind a shelterbelt always tended to be greater in oblique than in perpendicular wind. The wind reduction behind a leafy vegetation belt decreased as the reference wind speed increased. The approach wind speed affected wind reduction much more at a porous shelterbelt than at a dense one. The difference between reference and local wind directions could be great just behind a shelterbelt but this difference disappeared within a few h downstream of the belt. With further increasing distance (up to 4-11 h), the wind continued to veer so that the direction became more parallel with the shelterbelt than in the case of the undisturbed wind. Then the wind slowly veered back to the direction of the approaching wind again. The present data give a good idea of the amount of wind reduction which can be expected in the lee of some common types of shelterbelts. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","1991","2020-10-29 20:13:32","2021-10-19 13:14:40","","363-385","","","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Contaminant concentrations were markedly higher in runoff from the slurry-amended plots than in runoff from the fertiliser-amended plots. After the first rainfall event, some contaminant concentrations in runoff from the slurry-amended plots declined with distance downslope (i.e. with buffer strip width), supporting the relative efficacy of the strip for retaining pollutants. After the second and third rainfall events, by contrast, our results suggest remobilisation of contaminants retained during the first event. Faecal bacteria levels (especially streptococcus levels) remained high throughout the study, even in percolates and runoff collected 8 m downslope after the third rainfall event, and indeed even downslope of the adjacent fertilizer-amended plots (indicating lateral movement): this suggests that bacterial contamination may be the most significant risk arising from slurry application.","2002","2020-10-29 20:13:35","2020-10-29 20:13:35","","261-271","","","82","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inoculation with the Earthworm Inoculation Unit technique was at the up-slope end of the field, in the field margins under permanent grass, and inside the four 0.46 ha plots of the field. The experiment was monitored on three occasions. In 1998 the L terrestris population had persisted in low numbers only in field and plot margins. By 2003, when the field had been under set-aside grass for three years, density had grown in the margins and L terrestris were also found inside the field at a very low density. The third monitoring was in autumn 2009, after a further four years as set-aside and a subsequent division of the field into no-till and ploughing management, and looked at the effects of management (margins, no-till, ploughing). distance from the inoculation and sub-drainage on L terrestris abundance. The abundance displayed a clear gradient over the field, declining from 14 ind. and 18 gm(-2) at 5-9 m from inoculation, to 1 ind. and 2 gm(-2) at 56-60 m distance. Margins had the highest abundances (16 ind. and 32 gm(-2)), followed by no-till (4 ind. and 4 gm(-2)) and ploughing (1 ind. and 1 gm(-2)). Abundances were significantly higher above the tiles than between them (P<0.05). The results demonstrate the importance of no-till and sub-drain line habitats as settlement supports for the inoculated population. Field margins proved to be decisive for inoculation success, by providing bridgeheads for population establishment and later by acting as source areas for the colonisation of the field. This finding highlights the general importance of field margins in the dispersal ecology of earthworms in arable landscapes. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

This study examined past effects of various agricultural best management practices (BMPs) implemented in the Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW) and investigated potential strategies to target future BMPs within this 72 km 2 watershed in northcentral Missouri as part of the CEAP. Objectives of this study were to (1) quantify effects of BMPs on dissolved atrazine and nitrate-N loads in the GCEW, (2) predict future monitoring required to detect statistically significant changes in dissolved atrazine and nitrate-N load, (3) determine number and extent of BMP establishment required in the GCEW to reach detectable reductions in dissolved atrazine and nitrate-N based on BMPs known to be effective in this setting, (4) develop new methods to quantify and report soil redoximorphic features (SRFs), and (5) investigate advantages/disadvantages associated with development of targeted BMP strategies based on hydrologic simulations, terrain analyses, and quantification of SRFs. Evaluation of storm events between 1993 and 2006 showed no significant effect of BMPs on dissolved atrazine and nitrate-N after 14% of the GCEW had been affected by BMP establishment. Approximately 20 and 4 years of post-BMP implementation monitoring was predicted before a statistically significant (α=0.05) 25% reduction in mean dissolved atrazine and nitrate-N can be demonstrated at the GCEW outlet, respectively. Twenty two percent and 34% of cropped fields in the GCEW required establishment of vegetative filter strips to reduce dissolved atrazine and NO 3 -N loads by 25% at the GCEW based on predictions from a hydrologic model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Assuming full adoption of this targeted BMP program and available funding, a minimum of 10 years would be required for on-the-ground implementation of this plan based on consultation with local conservationists in the GCEW. However, conservationists indicated this BMP, while effective for improving water quality in this setting, is not likely to be widely adopted by landowners/farm operators due to loss of farmable acreage and complex, cost-share program requirements. The use of a digital camera, image classification software, and exposed soil cores allowed a highly accurate (99%), standardized identification of soil redoximorphic features (SRFs), a soil property widely used to determine soil saturation, hydrologic flow paths, and wetland occurrence. Further digital image processing allowed the determination of representative elementary areas for Low Chroma (17.7 cm 2 ) and High Chroma (25.4 cm2 ) SRFs, allowing for repeatable documentation of SRFs while incorporating inherent soil property variability into measurements. A targeted plan to implement BMPs in the GCEW will differ based on the use of a widely used hydrologic model (SWAT) and terrain analyses (topographic wetness index), identifying fields adjacent to stream as the highest risk for pollutant loss or fields along GCEW borders as high runoff producing areas, respectively. This disagreement indicated terrain analyses such as the topographic wetness index may not accurately predict sensitive landscape positions when soil properties are assumed to be spatially uniform and local hydraulic gradients are based on soil surfaces. Correlation between SRFs and the topographic wetness index was found for one of two GCEW fields, indicating field soil surveys may serve as relatively quick reconnaissance methods to identify sensitive field areas and concentrated flow paths but additional research may be needed to verify these findings at their field locations. This research highlighted the need for continual on-the-ground monitoring and evaluation programs that validate hydrologic predictions and targeting strategies so future agricultur l conservation may benefit from past and future l ssons learned.","2010","2020-10-29 20:13:38","2020-10-29 20:13:38","","","365","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9781267055958","","","","Biological sciences; 0481:Soil sciences; Soil sciences; eppi-reviewer4; Agricultural conservation; Water quality; Watershed; Wildlife benefits","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper addresses these issues by using data collected from a detailed field experiment, carried out on two topographically different hillslopes (one steep and the other flat) located within an agricultural catchment in Western Australia. Continuous hydrometric data and measurements of chemical tracers, geochemical parameters, and NO(3)(-) concentrations taken from the shallow perched aquifer across riparian, midslope, and upland locations were analyzed and interpreted through a simple process-based numerical model of transport and reaction. The NO(3)(-) concentration data indicated that the temporal and spatial patterns of NO(3)(-) concentrations within the hillslopes are linked to the state of hydrological connectivity of the three landscape units as the shallow perched aquifer developed during the winter. Significant NO(3)(-) attenuation occurs within the riparian zones after the transport of NO(3)(-) from midslope sources begins. Application of a mixing model, which partitions the riparian zones into three water source components, and the numerical model of NO(3)(-) transport and reaction indicates that different mechanisms, dilution in the steep hillslope and denitrification in the flat hillslope, are responsible for much of the observed NO(3)(-) attenuation in the riparian zones. In this way, this work highlights the importance of hillslope topography in determining the relative roles of transport and reaction in NO(3)(-) attenuation and export from riparian zones. The experimental results also supported the use of the Damkohler number, a simple dimensionless number that is a measure of the competition between transport and reaction processes, which allowed a favorable comparison of our findings with previous results published in the literature for different geographical settings.","2006","2020-10-29 20:13:39","2021-10-19 13:14:26","","","","","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In spite of this, sheltered soybeans had higher leaf water potential and stomatal conductance, and lower leaf temperature. These differences between treatments were attributable, entirely, to shelter-induced modification of the growing season microclimate. Leaf area index, dry matter production and bean yield were significantly increased in shelter during both years. Bean yield in shelter was 20 and 26% higher than in exposed plots in 1978 and 1979, respectively. Bean production per ha-cm of water used in 1979 was 58 kg for sheltered soybeans and 47 kg for those in exposed plots. Results of this study indicated that under rainfed conditions, increased water-use efficiency and significant increases in bean yield can be expected from sheltered soybeans.","1981","2020-10-29 20:13:41","2021-10-19 13:14:17","","625-628","","","73","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The field located in deforested area was treated as the control. The studies were aimed at estimating the changes in community structure (composition, density, biomass) of soil and litter macrofauna, (mainly dipteran larvae), related to shelterbelt age both within shelterbelts as in adjoining fields. The results were compared to previous studies carried out in 1999-2000 in the same agricultural landscape.

The same was true for taxonomic richness. Ecotone zone of both transects was characterised by the greatest density and biomass of animals, mainly those of mobile epigeic animals, particularly the ants. The density and biomass values were declining in the field with the increasing distance from the shelterbelt. Across the transect of an older (10-11 years old) shelterbelt and adjacent field the density and biomass of studied animals were higher in all plots than across the younger (5-6 years old) one. It can be concluded, that the effect of the shelterbelt increases with age of planted trees. The results confirm the previous suggestions of the enhancement of the field macrofauna by forested strips.

Vegetative buffers in agricultural landscapes can provide a range of important ecological services, including conservation of native flora and fauna, enhancement of biological pest control and reduction of agrochemical drift. Typically, studies addressing the impact of such vegetative elements focus on one particular benefit. We investigated whether the benefits of field margins that had been established for conservation of northern bobwhite quail Colinus virginianus populations extended to the enhancement of biological pest control in adjacent conservation tillage cotton fields. 2. Densities of a selection of insect species and the predation and parasitism rates of insect pest species were measured in first- and second-year field margins established for bobwhite quail as well as in an adjacent cotton crop. 3. Second-year field margins yielded higher densities of all species sampled, with the exception of staphylinids and cotton aphids. Despite this, thrips and their predator, Orius insidiosus, were the only species that were also more abundant in the adjacent cotton field. Tachinids and Trichogramma and Lygus species, appeared to prefer the field margin vegetation over the cotton. 4. Overall, the impact of second-year margins on the cotton crop did not significantly differ from first-year margins with regard to pest occurrence or biological control. 5. Analysis of the sugar content in Meteorus autographae, a generalist parasitoid of Lepidoptera larvae, suggested that this species is severely food-limited in the field margins established for bobwhite quail. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that field margins designed to specifically benefit bobwhite quail may be unsuitable for providing other ecological services. By making small adjustments in the vegetative composition of these field margins, such as adding early season nectar-producing plants, it may be feasible to combine biodiversity and pest-control benefits and thereby optimize the overall ecological services to be gained.

The cultural dimensions of hedgerows and their implications for future hedged landscapes were investigated through the collection and exploration of different groups perspectives--, public, farmers and experts--in England and Canada, using a diversity of primary and secondary data sources. English hedgerows were important to all groups. Everyone liked hedged landscapes for aesthetic, visual and wildlife reasons. They were important for the way they break up the landscape; provide signs of the changing seasons; their sense of mystery and intimacy; their connections with the past and childhood memories. They are also seen as part of England's history and national identity. Such cultural identity was absent in the Canadian data. However, some groups also held a rational or objective view which was dominant over this subjective or emotional view and which effects where they draw the boundaries to their systems of interest. Farmers were most concerned with their farms (and the hedgerows they owned) as a business, while experts dealt mainly with the ecological aspects of hedgerows. There was found to be little awareness of others groups views with different groups seeing the same action in very different ways. Even where there was contact between farmers and experts, there could be a lack of trust. Finally, it is noted that policy and practice towards hedgerows have ignored many of these relationships and that the approach used here offers opportunities to examine the different systems of interest.","2000","2020-10-29 20:13:45","2020-10-29 20:13:45","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we describe the effect of field margins on the diet of Eurasian Skylark nestlings and adults living on intensively managed Dutch farmland. We tested the hypotheses that field margins offer a higher diversity of invertebrate prey than intensively managed crops, and that the diet of nestlings receiving food from field margins will therefore be more diverse than that of other nestlings. Field margins had a greater variety of invertebrate prey groups to offer than the intensively managed crops. Coleoptera were the most frequently and most abundantly eaten prey group by both adults and nestlings. Together, Coleoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Araneae accounted for 91% of the nestling diet. Nestlings ate larger prey items and a larger proportion of larvae than adults. Almost 75% of both adults and nestlings consumed plant material, perhaps indicating a scarcity of invertebrate resources. When provided with food from field margins, the mean number of invertebrate orders in the nestling diet increased significantly from 4.7 to 5.5 and the number of families from 4.2 to 5.8 per sample. Thus, birds that used field margins for foraging could indeed provide their young with more invertebrate prey groups than birds only foraging in crops and grassland.","2014","2020-10-29 20:13:47","2020-10-29 20:13:47","","161-U135","","","102","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A field trial was conducted from 2007 to 2009 in north-east Italy in order to evaluate the effectiveness of various types of vegetative filter strips to reduce spring-summer runoff of the herbicides mesotrione, metolachlor and terbuthylazine, widely used in maize, and to evaluate the effect of the rainfall characteristics on the runoff volume and concentration. Results show that without vegetative filter strip the herbicide load that reaches the surface water is about 5–6gha−1 year−1 for metolachlor and terbuthylazine (i.e. 0.5–0.9% of the applied rate), confirming that runoff from flat fields as in the Po Valley can have a minor effect on the water quality, and that most of the risk is posed by a few, or even just one extreme rainfall event with a return period of about 25–27years, causing runoff with a maximum concentration of 64–77μgL−1. Mesotrione instead showed rapid soil disappearance and was observed at a concentration of 1.0–3.8μgL−1 only after one extreme (artificial) rainfall. Vegetative filter strips of any type are generally effective and can reduce herbicide runoff by 80–88%. Their effectiveness is steady even under severe rainfall conditions, and this supports their implementation in an environmental regulatory scheme at a catchment or regional scale.

Since VFS are dynamic systems, their performance would not remain constant over the years indicating the need to define suitable buffer management. In order to evaluate the performance of different five and six year-old VFS, the runoff of the herbicides metolachlor and terbuthylazine was monitored in 2002 and 2003 in an experimental site in northern Italy. The structure of the herbaceous cover in the buffers changes over time. When rows of trees are present, the grass cover is decreased by the shading action of the trees, but the leaf litter gains importance. In VFS with grass cover only, the cover composition changes because of the substitution of grass by broadleaf species. Six metres wide VFS are very effective in reducing runoff volume and concentration during both wet and dry years. Classification analysis showed that runoff concentration and volume are linked to the characteristics of the rainfall event, buffer, source of herbicides and time after application. Regression analysis showed that the significant predictors for runoff volume are rainfall amount and intensity, total vegetal cover in the VFS, crop leaf area index and time after treatment; for concentration they are rainfall intensity, crop leaf area index and total vegetal cover in the VFS. The role of VFS is complex, so appropriate management is required to maintain its increasing filtering capacity over time.

Astroturf mats (n = 136) were placed within contrasting buffer features at nine sites [mid-field hedges (two sites), edge-of-field grass strips (six sites) and channel wetlands (one site)] within the River Parrett basin in England. Sediment was recorded on the mats at seven of the sites during the 18-month sampling period. At the other two sites either there was insufficient erosion or sediment by-passed the mats. At the seven sites where mats collected sediment, there was a considerable range in sediment deposition over the 18-month sampling period with site-average values (based on all mats at a site) ranging from 0.02 +/- 0.06 to 1. 15 +/- 1.88 g cm(-2); the average for all 136 mats was 0.41 +/- 1.08 g cm(-2), or approximately 0.27 g cm(-2) year(-1). Most of the sediment collected on the mats (n = 60) was sand-sized (> 63 mu m) material. The site-average total-P content of the < 63 mu m fraction of the deposited sediment ranged between 616 and 1938 mg kg(-1) (average 890 mg kg(-1)). About half of all the mats that collected sediment were from the front of the buffers. Comparison of the sediment in the buffer features with topsoil from the contributing upslope fields suggests that the buffers trap coarser sediment with lower P concentrations, than the contributing topsoil. This suggests that the finer fraction, enriched in total-P, may be passing through the buffers towards river channels. Comparison between sites indicates that sediment deposition within buffers is greater at sites with steeper slopes, erodible soils and certain types of land use, Such as maize for silage, reflecting the greater soil erosion and sediment transfers in these fields. The location and careful design of buffer features is a key factor in their effectiveness.","2007","2020-10-29 20:13:49","2021-10-19 13:13:57","","165-175","","","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Performance of narrow strips of Vetiver (Vetiveria zizanioides) and Napier (Pennisetum purpureum) grass in controlling nutrient loss and runoff was determined on a clay loam soil in Kenya. Grass strips were planted in March 2000, and nutrient loss and runoff measurements were carried out from June 2000 to August 2001 (15 months). Compared with the control, Napier grass reduced PO4-P, NO2-N, NO3-N and NH4-N by 55, 70, 45 and 47%, respectively, while Vetiver grass reduced them by 11, 35, 11 and 0%, respectively.

Surface run-off caused by natural rainfall and related transport of metolachlor, terbuthylazine and pendimethalin were measured on plots of 40 m length without filter strips (F0), and after passing over three types of herbicide-untreated field margin: 12 m conservation headland (CH12), 6 m (GF6) and 12 m grass strips (GF12). Run-off was also measured after simulated rainfall on 7 m long plots without (F0) and with 3 m grass strips (GF3). All three herbicides were transported both in dissolved and in adsorbed forms; the partitioning depended on their water solubility with metolachlor and terbuthylazine mainly translocated in dissolved form (F0: highest mean concentrations for a natural run-off event 721 and 220 mu g L-1, respectively). Pendimethalin was predominantly transported in adsorbed form (maximum mean concentration 11.2 mu g L-1). In the sediment, the highest mean herbicide contents in a single natural event (F0) accounted for 2294 mu g kg(-1) (metolachlor), 1317 mu g kg(-1) (terbuthylazine) and 5648 mu g kg(-1) (pendimethalin). The proportions of applied herbicide translocated were 0.3% (metolachlor), 0.2% (terbuthylazine) and 0.06% (pendimethalin; F0, natural rainfall). The extent of herbicide transport decreased with time but within this trend soil sealing, soil moisture and amount and intensity of rainfall increased losses.

Study sites were located along spring-fed streams in the unglaciated region of southwestern Wisconsin, USA. At each site, plant community surveys were conducted using a point transect method. Among the treatments, woody buffer strips, rotationally grazed and continuously grazed riparian areas had greater plant species richness than grassy buffer strips, and woody buffer strips had the greatest native plant specie's richness. Reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) was prevalent in grassy buffer strips (44% of all observations), common in woody buffer strips (15%), and rare in sites that were rotationally or continuously grazed (3 and 5%, respectively). Pasture sites had greater proportions of native grasses and grass relatives and moderate levels of overall native species richness. Considered a water quality best management practice, well-managed rotational grazing may be a reasonable alternative to buffer strips which can contribute to protection and enhancement of native vegetation biodiversity.

To determine the risk insecticides pose to quail, we quantified exposure rates and hazard. Exposure rate depends on quail habitat use in relation to insecticide applications, whereas hazard depends on susceptibility to a toxin and the dose an individual receives. Because providing early-successional vegetation around row-crop fields is a typical habitat management recommendation, we determined rates of exposure of quail and their broods to insecticides applied to soybean fields with and without vegetated field borders. Radiocollared quail (n = 69) used soybean fields extensively (64% of telemetry locations) at the time of year insecticides were applied. Quail used soybean fields twice as often when vegetated borders surrounded crop fields (P = 0.04). Ten of 18 broods monitored by telemetry were located in soybean fields 88% of the time. In 1993, 4 of 6 broods <14 days old were in crop fields at the time insecticides were aerially applied. Mesocosm trials simulating worst-case exposure of quail chicks to insecticides resulted in no chick mortality or depression of brain cholinesterase (ChE) activity for the currently used insecticides thiodicarb and methomyl (P > 0.49). However, ChE activity was depressed (P < 0.001) and body mass was lower (P = 0.02) in chicks exposed to methyl parathion, which historically (pre-1980) received significant use in production of row crops in North Carolina. Our results, along with data on use and toxicity of other insecticides applied to row crops, collectively suggest direct affects to survival of quail chicks from use of foliar-applied insecticides does not explain reduced quail densities on agricultural landscapes.","1998","2020-10-29 20:13:53","2021-10-19 13:13:47","","1565-1573","","","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, research on bobwhite population response to field-border practices is sparse. Previous research on 2 farms documented increased use of farm fields and greater reproduction by bobwhites on farms with field borders, but nesting success was low during May and June. Bobwhite population response to field-border practices may increase when they are combined with nest-predator reduction on farms. Effect of nest-predator reduction on bobwhite populations on farmed landscapes has not been investigated in the Southeast. Therefore, we tested the effects of field borders and mesomammal nest-predator reduction on bobwhite abundance on 12 farms in eastern North Carolina, 1997-1999. We applied treatments to farms as factorial combinations. Reduction of mesomammal nest predators, including raccoons (Procyon lotor), Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), and foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus and Vulpes vulpes), occurred from February-May of each year. To assess bobwhite response to treatments, we measured summer abundance of males using variable-radius point counts and covey abundance on farms in September and October using morning covey-call surveys. Bobwhites were more abundant on farms with field borders during summer (P=0.08). On field-border farms we heard 1.8x the number of coveys heard on farms without field borders (P=0.004). Summer abundance of bobwhites did not differ as a result of predator reductions (P=0.37), and we heard slightly fewer coveys on predator-reduction farms (P =0.084) during autumn. However, we heard more coveys on farms with both field borders and predator reduction compared to all other farms (P=0.022). Field-border systems were a practical management technique to increase autumn abundance of bobwhites on individual farms in eastern North Carolina.

However, observational evidence suggests that concentrated flow is prevalent from agricultural fields. Over time sediment can accumulate in riparian buffers forming berms that restrict sheet flow; these berms ultimately back up surface runoff, resulting in an eventual breakthrough that concentrates overland flow. This study examines the occurrence of concentrated flow paths (CFPs) in riparian buffers at both the field and watershed scale. At the field scale, intensive topographic surveys were conducted at ten field sites in southern Illinois. To assess the prevalence of CFPs at the watershed scale, three watersheds in southern Illinois were selected for walking stream surveys along randomly selected 1,000 m reaches. CFPs were identified in all topographic surveys and all walking stream surveys. Among field sites, concentrated flow accounted for 82.5-100% of the drainage leaving the agricultural fields. Sediment berm accumulation was identified at all field sites and was positively correlated with CFP size. At the watershed scale, CFPs were more abundant in agricultural areas compared to forested land. Results from this study indicate that concentrated flow was prevalent across all study sites at both the field and watershed scale. Thus, surface water quality may suffer in areas with poorly functioning buffers, and managers must consider the occurrence of CFPs when designing and maintaining riparian buffers to protect stream water quality.","2012","2020-10-29 20:13:55","2020-10-29 20:13:55","","191-205","","","84","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The boundaries were between small pasture, small arable or large arable fields. 3.

The study was over several years (winter and summer) at two sites, Huntingdon and Swavesey, in East Anglia UK. 2. The present paper deals with similar relationships, but the bird variables used are the abundance of individual species, of groups of species (all finches, all raptors, etc.) and of all birds, as well as Simpson's index of diversity. This required extensive modelling - 105 models for Huntingdon and 174 for Swavesey. 3. The results of all 279 models are presented in a condensed form, highlighting the importance of given field boundary attributes to particular species or groups of species. 4. Like bird species richness in the earlier paper, the abundance of many species was strongly influenced by the land use, and by the main vegetation variables (tree height and number, hedgerow length, height and width). Land use was important to a larger majority of species, the exceptions being carrion crow, pheasant, reed bunting and wren. 5. Verge width appeared important for small insectivores (blue tit) and was particularly important for seed eating birds, e.g. most finches and buntings, red-legged partridge in summer, and carrion crow and skylark in winter. 6. Ditch dimensions were associated with the abundance of some seed eaters (linnet, reed bunting and goldfinch) and insectivores (blackbird, great tit, skylark, song thrush and wren). Kestrel and the groups raptors, corvids, waders and aquatics were associated with large ditches. 7. Though the general management prescriptions to benefit the majority of farmland birds were found to be similar to those in the earlier paper, the detailed species specific modelling made it possible to examine the habitat requirements of particular species. 8. Ecological evaluation of the results from the two studies are presented in a form considered to be of value for practical management.","1995","2020-10-29 20:13:58","2021-10-19 13:14:26","","362-371","","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The WSA was determined by wet sieving method while the enzyme activities were colorimetrically quantified using a spectrophotometer in laboratory assays. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents were also determined. Two soil depths (0-10 and 10-20 cm) were analyzed for all treatments. The row-crop treatment showed significantly lower activities compared to all other treatments for beta-glucosidase and beta-glucosaminidase enzymes along with lower WSA. The dehydrogenase activities were significantly higher in GP treatment compared to RC treatment. The FDA hydrolase activities were not significantly different among treatments. Surface soil revealed higher enzyme activities and higher WSA than the subsurface soil. The treatment by depth interaction was significant for beta-glucosidase and beta-glucosaminidase enzymes. The soil organic carbon and total nitrogen data strongly supported the results of enzyme activities and WSA. Implications can be made that perennial vegetation enhances organic matter accumulation in the soil, has minimum disturbance to the soil and will have positive impacts on the ecosystem.

Our objective was to examine the effects of these land uses on the activities of selected enzymes (beta-glucosidase, beta-glucosaminidase, fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolase, and dehydrogenase), proportion of water stable aggregates (WSA), soil organic carbon and total nitrogen content. Four management treatments [grazed pasture (GP), agroforestry buffer (AgB), grass buffer (GB) and row crop (RC)] were sampled in 2009 and 2010 at two depths (0 to 10- and 10 to 20-cm) and analyzed. Most of the soil quality indicators were significantly greater under perennial vegetation when compared to row crop treatments. Although there were numerical variations, soil quality response trends were consistent between years. The beta-glucosaminidase activity increased slightly from 156 to 177 mu g PNP g(-1) dry soil while beta-glucosidase activity slightly decreased from 248 to 237 mu g PNP g(-1) dry soil in GB treatment during 2 years. The surface (0-10 cm depth) had greater enzyme activities and WSA than sub-surface (10-20 cm) samples. WSA increased from 178 to 314 g kg(-1) in row crop areas while all other treatments had similar values during the 2 year study. The treatment by depth interaction was significant (P < 0.05) for beta-glucosidase and beta-glucosaminidase enzymes in 2009 and for dehydrogenase and beta-glucosaminidase in 2010. Soil enzyme activities were significantly correlated with soil organic carbon content (r a parts per thousand yen 0.94, P < 0.0001). This is important because soil enzyme activities and microbial biomass can be enhanced by perennial vegetation and thus improve several other soil quality parameters. These results also support the hypothesis that positive interactions among management practices, soil biota and subsequent environmental quality effects are of great agricultural and ecological importance.","2012","2020-10-29 20:14:00","2021-10-19 13:14:45","","311-323","","","84","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cirl bunting numbers increased by 83% on land entering CSS management agreements between 1992 and 1998, compared with an increase of just 2% on adjacent countryside not managed under CSS. The increase in cirl buntings on stewardship land was part of a wider regional increase in abundance rather than a redistribution of birds away from land not under stewardship. In 1998, 22% of all UK cirl buntings were breeding on land under CSS agreements and a further 16% of birds were within 0.5 km of land under stewardship. All but one of the 27 agreements that gained cirl buntings were within 2 km of cirl bunting breeding sites in 1992, with more distant agreements failing to be colonised even if they offered a range of potentially beneficial prescriptions. Agreements providing grass margins around arable fields, weedy winter stubbles and open patches of grassland next to scrub tended to gain additional cirl buntings. Grass margins and weedy winter stubbles constitute important food-rich habitats for cirl buntings and other farmland birds, and should be encouraged in future agri-environment agreements and schemes.

We used an information-theoretic approach to determine support for hypotheses concerning effects of nest-site, habitat-patch, edge, and temporal factors on nest success of songbirds in three narrow (55-95 m) and three wide (400-530 m) riparian forests with adjacent grassland-shrub buffer strips and in three narrow and three wide riparian forests without adjacent grassland-shrub buffer strips. We predicted that temporal effects would have the most support and that habitat-patch and edge effects would have little support, because nest predation would be great across all sites in the highly fragmented, predominantly agricultural landscape. Interval nest success was 0.404, 0.227, 0.070, and 0.186, respectively, for Gray Catbird (Dumetella carolinensis), Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), and forest interior species pooled (Acadian Flycatcher [Empidonax virescens], Wood Thrush [Hylociclila mustelina], Ovenbird [Seiurus aurocapillus], and Kentucky Warbler [Oporornis formosus]). The effect of nest stage on nest success had the most support; daily nest success for Gray Catbird and Indigo Bunting were lowest in the laying stage. We found strong support for greater nest success of Gray Catbird in riparian forests with adjacent buffer strips than in riparian forests without adjacent buffer strips. Patch width also occurred in the most-supported model for Gray Catbird, but with very limited support. The null model received the most support for Northern Cardinal. Riparian forests provided breeding habitat for area-sensitive forest species and grassland-shrub nesting species. Buffer strips provided additional breeding habitat for grassland-shrub nesting Species. Interval nest success for Indigo Bunting and area-sensitive forest species pooled, however, fell well below the level that is likely necessary to balance juvenile and adult mortality, which suggests that when riparian forests are located within agricultural landscapes, the potential even for wide riparian forests with adjacent buffer strips to provide high-quality breeding habitat is severely diminished for some species.","2004","2020-10-29 20:14:01","2021-10-19 13:13:58","","726-737","","","121","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The seed banks of recent hedge banks were richer and more diversified than those of old hedge banks. Differences in the floristic composition of the established plant cover between the recent and old hedge banks were determined by multivariate analyses. The species exclusively found in the seed bank and in the herb cover of recent hedge banks were mainly grassland species, whereas the species that only occurred on old hedge banks tended to be woodland species. The floristic composition of the two compartments (established vegetation and seed bank) was very different. A multivariate analysis revealed that the difference between the composition of the seed banks of recent and old hedge banks was less than that between the composition of the established vegetation and seed bank of hedge banks of the same age.

During the study period (March 1981 to March 1982), dramatic changes in water-borne nutrient loads occurred in the riparian forest of the watershed. From surface runoff waters that had transited .apprxeq. 50 m of riparian forest, an estimated 4.1 Mg of particulates, 11 kg of particulate organic-N, 0.83 kg of ammonium-N, 2.7 kg of nitrate-N and 3.0 kg of total particulate-P per ha of riparian forest were removed during the study year. In addition, an estimated removal of 45 kg .cntdot. ha-1 .cntdot. yr-1 of nitrate-N occurred in subsurface flow as it moved through the riparian zone. Nutrient uptake rates for the cropland and riparian forest were estimated. These systems were then compared with respect to their pathways of nutrient flow and ability to retain nutrients. The cropland appeared to retain fewer nutrients than the riparin forest and is thought to incur the majority of its nutrient losses in harvested crop. The dominant pathway of total-N loss from the riparian forest seemed to be subsurface flux. P loss from the riparian forest appeared almost evenly divided between surface and subsurface losses. Nutrient removals in the riparian forest are thought to be of ecological significance to receiving waters and indicate that coupling natural systems and managed habitats within a watershed may reduce diffuse-source pollution.","1984","2020-10-29 20:14:05","2021-10-19 13:14:30","","1466-1475","","","65","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The distribution of this species on the site was strongly related to landscape connectivity. Occupied habitats are the least isolated from a source of colonizers. Connectivity measured as the distance to the nearest occupied site calculated along the hedgerow network and weighted by the quality of their wooded elements (WD) is a good predictor of the distribution of Abax parallelepipedus in the study area. Many landscape changes have occured between 1952 and 1993 both in the structure and the quality of the wooded network in this area. As a consequence, functional isolation between sample sites has increased by 28% since 1952. The results indicate that the current distribution of Abax parallelepipedus in the network is significantly better related to the 1952 landscape than to the current one. This may indicate the existence of a time lag between landscape changes and the reaction of Abax parallelepipedus to such modifications. The relationship remains the same over a broad range of spatial scales. This result should lead to the consideration of landscape history in species distribution analysis.","1998","2020-10-29 20:14:05","2021-10-19 13:13:52","","243-252","","","69","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied radio-collared hares for 13 months in a mixed agricultural area using 'homing in' to provide high spatial-resolution fixes. Hares selected agri-environment field margins during both active and inactive periods and used the areas in the middle of large fields less frequently than those closer to the field boundaries. Blocks of woods and lines of trees were selected as resting sites while sheep-grazed fields were generally avoided throughout the year. We suggest that agri-environment schemes targeted at creating and increasing non-farmed habitat features associated with field boundaries and reducing sward depletion through less intensive or mixed grazing regimes could prove beneficial for populations of this priority species in farmland.

Within each field, plots with and without wildflower strips were sampled and a grid design of 3 m x 3 m was used to analyze the spatial pattern of parasitism. The provision of wildflower strips provided an idiosyncratic effect on the control of lepidopterans: parasitism rates in M. brassicae eggs and larvae were not affected, whereas parasitism rates of larval P. rapae were significantly enhanced by the wildflower strips at one of the two sites. Moreover, at one site predation rates on M. brassicae eggs were significantly enhanced in the wildflower strip plots. Geostatistical analysis showed no distinct spatial patterns in parasitism rates.

The area appeared as species-rich, compared to other anthropogenic habitats in the Po river pain. Most of the collected Carabids were species with a wide distribution in the Paleartic region, eurytopic and common in European agroecosystems.

Interactions between fleshy-fruited plants and frugivorous birds are highly seasonal in temperate ecosystems. Nevertheless, combined effects of landscape modification and seasonal variation on plant-frugivore interactions have never been assessed from a network perspective. Here, we present the first study that simultaneously investigates effects of landscape modification and seasonal variation on plant-frugivore interactions and on functional and interaction diversity of plant-frugivore networks. We recorded visitation rates of 39 frugivorous bird species to 28 fruiting-plant species in Central Germany from early summer to late autumn in hedgerows within three landscape types arranged along a gradient of decreasing anthropogenic modification and increasing structural diversity (i.e., farmland, orchard, forest edge). We analyzed how species richness, abundance, and community composition, as well as functional and interaction diversity of fruiting plants and frugivorous birds changed with landscape type, fruit availability, and season. We found that visitation rates of frugivorous birds were lower in farmland, but only in summer. In autumn, visitation rates were similar in all landscape types and strongly increased with increasing local fruit availability. The functional diversity of fruits and frugivorous birds and their interaction diversity remained surprisingly constant in all landscape types. Due to seasonal changes in communities of fruiting plants and frugivorous birds, functional dispersion of fruiting plants was lower in autumn than in summer, whereas functional richness and dispersion of frugivorous birds was higher in autumn than in summer. Our results indicate that seasonal changes in fruit availability influence the abundance of frugivorous birds along gradients of structural diversity at the landscape scale. Although seasonal fluctuations influenced the functional diversity of avian frugivore communities, we found constant interaction diversity of plant-frugivore networks in space and time, probably due to the functional redundancy of frugivorous birds. These findings indicate a high robustness of avian frugivory to moderate levels of human-induced landscape modification in temperate ecosystems and call for studies testing the generality of these findings for ultimate avian seed dispersal functions.","2013","2020-10-29 20:14:12","2021-10-19 13:13:43","","1296-1306","","","94","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fruits; eppi-reviewer4; Anthropogenic landscape modification; Central Germany; Frugivory; Functional diversity; Functional traits; Mutualistic networks; Plant-bird interactions; Seasonal fluctuation; Seed dispersal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, traditional fallow field borders lack sufficient pollen and nectar sources required to sustain beneficial insect populations; therefore, borders planted to a mix of native prairie flowers and grasses may be needed if increases in beneficial insect populations are desired. Although the value of fallow borders to birds has been established, little is known about bird use of beneficial insect habitats. Using single-observer transect surveys, we compared overwintering sparrow densities among 4 field border treatments (planted native warm season grasses and prairie flowers, planted prairie flowers only, fallow, and mowed) replicated around 9 organic crop fields from November to March 2009-2010 and 2010-2011. Sparrow densities were 5-10 times lower in mowed borders than in other border treatments in 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, but did not differ among planted and fallow borders in either year.

Rivers can be subjected to a range of anthropogenic pressures and agricultural land use is one major cause of water pollution and habitat degradation in European rivers. The Water Framework Directive is a major legislative driver for good ecological status in Europe's rivers and in the UK; this has led to attempts to reduce the negative effects of agriculture on rivers through agri-environment schemes (AES). AES are funded from tax revenue and it is important that they are optimized to deliver measurable ecological improvements. The purpose of this paper is to assess the ecological effectiveness of AES in a lowland English river basin. We examined the effect of distance from river in optimizing AES for the biological heath and conservation value of rivers. We used aquatic macroinvertebrates as indicators of river health and conservation value, to assess the effects of AES likely to improve river health (hereafter ""AES river options""). This catchment in lowland England had a very high (over 80%) level of uptake of entry level AES, and facilitated a comparison between schemes that do or do not contain AES river options. The conservation value of macroinvertebrate communities and the proportion of macroinvertebrates intolerant of water pollution and sedimentation increased with high proportions of woodland within 100 m or 500 m of the river throughout the entire upstream catchment. High proportions of AES river options within the same distance were correlated with higher proportions of sediment-sensitive macroinvertebrates. We conclude that for improving biological quality or promoting the conservation value of river communities, AES will be optimized by preserving woodland within a 100-500 m buffer zone along the upstream length of the river.

We studied the influence of live fence characteristics on species richness and fence use by birds by examining both local and landscape factors. We studied three types of live fences: planted fences of a native tree, planted fences of an exotic, and spontaneous. They were either connected to forest fragments or isolated, and were all within a pasture matrix. Spontaneous and planted live fences maintain a diverse plant (77 shrub and tree species) and bird communities (98 species). Fence types strongly differed in vegetation composition and structure. We found that by analyzing each fence characteristic independently, there was no difference in bird richness or abundance. However, there was a significant correlation when plant richness, structure, and connectivity were analyzed together. This could be the result of some variables counterbalancing each other. Birds used fences for a variety of purposes including foraging, breeding, and moving across the landscape. Native birds and plants used live fences as habitat and refuge in a landscape where large forest tracts have been lost for decades. Live fences in conjunction with small forest fragments maintain a diverse array of plant and birds species that are a subsample of the species originally found in the landscape before extensive deforestation. We recommend the establishment of live fences, allowing growth of spontaneous understory. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","2011","2020-10-29 20:14:17","2021-10-19 13:14:23","","15-30","","","81","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Agroforestry might be an effective alternative to recompose riparian forests. Soil chemical and microbial properties are important environmental indicators to evaluate the reclamation process. This study tested the hypothesis that, in the course of time, reforestation by means of agroforestry improved soil microbial and chemical properties in a riparian forest buffer. Soil samples were collected from three layers (0.0-2.5; 2.5-7.5; 7.5-20 cm) in two sectors of a reforested riparian buffer strip in Cananéia Farm, São Paulo state, Brazil, one 18 years old and other 28 years old, and in an adjacent pasture area. The samples were assessed for pHH2O, available P and K, exchangeable, Ca, Mg and Al, H+Al, sum of bases (SB), pH 7.0 CEC, percent base saturation (V), soil organic matter (SOM) and light organic matter (LOM). Microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) were analyzed only in the first layer. The pattern for Ca, Mg, SB and V (all layers) was 28-year-old sector = 18-year-old-sector > pasture. The SOM at 0.0-2.5 cm was higher in the 28-year-old sector. The LOM pattern was 28-year-old sector > 18-year-old sector > pasture. MBC did not differ among areas. MBN was significantly higher comparing the 28-year-old sector and the pasture area. The results probably reflected the higher litterfall and the N-richer organic matter in the reforested sectors. Reforestation by means of agroforestry improved soil quality, contributing to the ecosystem sustainability.","2013","2020-10-29 20:14:17","2021-10-19 13:13:40","","25-33","","","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we carried out a systematic investigation of the effects of habitat type and age on the quality of overwintering refuges for Coleoptera and Araneae on an arable farm in the UK. Hedgerow habitats contained taller and more diverse vegetation with a greater proportion of bare ground compared with field margins. Vegetation height and diversity, and the richness and cover of forbs all increased significantly with habitat age. Soil organic matter content also increased with habitat age, suggesting a more favourable structure for burrowing Coleoptera. Total abundance and richness of Coleoptera and Araneae were significantly higher in hedgerow habitats compared with the field margins. This largely reflected the response of staphylinid beetles, the most abundant group recorded. There was no effect of habitat age on overall abundance or diversity, suggesting the good dispersal ability of many farmland invertebrates, but also reflecting the close relationship between habitat age and type. The response of individual invertebrate species was more mixed: 10 species were recorded in significantly higher densities in the hedge base compared with one in the field margin. Similarly, eight species were recorded in significantly higher densities in mature habitats compared with four in recently established vegetation. There were significant interactions between habitat type and age for six species, of which four showed a marked preference for the base of mature hedgerows. These included both important predators of cereal aphids and crop pests. It was concluded that hedgerows provided the highest quality overwintering habitat for invertebrates emphasising the importance of strategies directed at conserving and enhancing this habitat. However, newly created field margins fulfilled a useful role in rapidly providing overwintering refuges for a more limited group of invertebrate species. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The most effective means of increasing abundance and diversity of bumblebees on farmland is to sow simple, low cost mixtures of dicotyledons rich in pollen and nectar, as prescribed under the UK agri-environment schemes. The potential benefits of this management prescription for butterflies are unknown. Similarly, more information is needed on how to manage this habitat to maximise the provision of pollen and nectar resources whilst protecting breeding habitat for butterflies. This study aimed to devise mixtures and cutting management regimes which address these issues. We found significant effects of seed mixture, timing and frequency of cutting, and removal of cut material on vegetation composition, flower resource availability and pollinators (the abundance, species richness and temporal distribution of butterflies and bumblebees, including males and queens, attracted to the mixtures). We recommend that nectar flower mixtures are refined by the inclusion of the best performing species to provide mid- and late-season forage resources (Trifolium spp., Lotus corniculatus and Centaurea nigra), and the removal of competitive grass species. Summer cutting in May or early June, with removal of herbage where possible, should be applied to half the patch to extend the flowering season, and minimise damage to butterfly breeding habitat. This should be accompanied by the typical autumn cut to the whole patch. Even with best management practice, such nectar flower mixtures are only effective for 3-4 years and this should be recognised in policies aimed at enhancing pollinator populations in agricultural landscapes.","2011","2020-10-29 20:14:18","2021-10-19 13:14:21","","853-864","","","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent UK agri-environmental policy aims to conserve and restore bumblebee populations by providing foraging habitats on arable field margins. We examined the effectiveness of strategies to achieve this, including sowing seed mixtures of (1) tussocky grass species, (2) wildflowers and (3) pollen- and nectar-rich plants. These were compared to conventionally managed cereal crops. Sampling was undertaken in 32 10×10km squares throughout England, each containing a sample of the different field margin types. Bumblebee abundance in July and August was significantly higher on pollen and nectar margins (86±14 bees per 100m) compared with wildflower margins (43±14), mature grass margins (6±14) and recently sown grass margins (8±4). Bees were virtually absent from the cereal crop (0.2±0.1). Bumblebee species richness was significantly higher on margins sown with either wildflowers or the pollen and nectar mix. There was evidence that richness of the bumblebee assemblage at the 10×10km square scale was positively correlated with land use heterogeneity, the proportion of grassland, and the abundance and richness of dicotyledon flowers. The abundance of long-tongued bees per margin was explained by the number of pollen and nectar agreements per 10×10km square, together with flower abundance. Future research is required to determine the quantity and location of foraging habitat required to sustain bumblebee populations at the landscape scale.

In this study, a simple and rapid methodology was employed to measure the quality of different habitats for butterfly species on 10 arable farms in lowland Britain. This habitat monitoring was seven times more rapid than the traditional species-based butterfly monitoring. Data on butterfly abundance were combined with the information gathered on habitat quality at five of the farms using stepwise regression. These models had a consistently high degree of explanatory power for the summary variables of total butterfly abundance and species richness, and the functional groupings of mobile and immobile species. There was good agreement between observed and predicted estimates of species richness and abundance when the models were validated on a further five independent sites. Models to predict the abundance of 11 common butterfly species were also produced. These varied considerably in their predictive power and validity between species. The results clearly demonstrated the beneficial effects of targeted habitat creation for butterflies which is promoted under the Agri-environment Schemes, especially the recently introduced pollen and nectar seed mixtures (WM2) available under the Countryside Stewardship Scheme. The models confirmed the importance of shelter, floristically diverse field margins and the availability of nectar resources from legume species in explaining the abundance of immobile butterfly species in arable landscapes. These sources of nectar and the presence of larval host plants in the crucifer family were important factors in explaining the abundance of mobile species. The results are discussed in terms of the potential of this approach for: (i) assessing habitat quality for butterflies in intensively managed landscapes; (ii) enhancing the value of butterfly monitoring schemes in explaining changes in butterfly abundance at the site and national scale; and (iii) informing habitat management and restoration guidelines for butterfly conservation on arable farmland.

The objective of this study was to characterize macroporosity of soils under a perennial grass hedge system for 12 yr using x-ray computed tomography (CT) and to compare CT-macroporosity results with macroporosity estimated from water retention data. Three positions were sampled: grass hedge position, deposition zone position 0.5 m upslope from grass hedges, and row crop position 7 m upslope from the hedges. Intact core samples (76 mm x 76 mm) were collected from two depths, 0 to 100 and 100 to 200 mm, with five replicates per position per depth. Number of pores (macro- and meso-), averaged across depths, in the grass hedge were nearly 2.5 times greater than those in the row crop and five times greater than in the deposition positions; however their circularity was 8.8% lower than in the row crop and 2.6% lower than in the deposition positions. The CT-measured macroporosity was significantly greater (P &lt; 0.01) for the grass hedge position (0.056 m3 m-3) as compared with the row crop (0.014 m3 m-3) and deposition positions (0.006 m 3 m-3). The fractal dimension (D) was significantly greater (P &lt; 0.01) for the grass hedge position (D = 1.56) than in the row crop (D = 1.31) and the deposition (D = 1.12) positions. The values of all measured pore characteristics decreased with depth. Computed tomography-measured macroporosity data were comparable with macroporosity estimated from water retention data. These findings suggest that grass hedge systems have created more pores and a greater volume of macroporosity. © Soil Science Society of America.","2005","2020-10-29 20:14:21","2020-10-29 20:14:21","","1609-1616","","","69","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study evaluated soil hydraulic properties within a grass hedge system 10 yr after establishment The study was conducted at the USDA-ARS research station near Treynor, IA in a field managed with switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) hedges. The soil was classified as Monona silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls). Three positions were sampled: within the grass hedges, within the deposition zone 0.5 m upslope from the grass hedges, and within the row crop area 7 m upslope from the hedges. Intact soil samples (76 by 76 mm) were taken from the three positions at four depths (100-mm increments) to determine saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), bulk density (ρb), and soil water retention. The grass hedge position had significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) macroporosity than the row crop and deposition positions in the first two depths and greater than the deposition position in the last two depths. The Ksat within the grass hedge (668 mm h-1) was six times greater than in the row crop position (115 mm h-1) and 18 times greater than in the deposition position (37 mm h-1) for the surface 10 cm. Bulk density and macroporosity were found to provide the best two-parameter regression model for predicting the log-transformed K sat (R2 = 0.68). These results indicate that grass hedges significantly affected soil hydraulic properties for this loess soil.","2004","2020-10-29 20:14:21","2021-10-19 13:14:44","","1386-1393","","","68","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://www.crossref.org/openurl?pid=zoteroDOI@wiernik.org&url_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fzotero.org%3A2&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=Soil%20hydraulic%20properties%20influenced%20by%20stiff-stemmed%20grass%20hedge%20systems&rft.jtitle=Soil%20Science%20Society%20of%20America%20Journal&rft.volume=68&rft.aufirst=A.&rft.aulast=Rachman&rft.au=A.%20Rachman&rft.au=S.%20H.%20Anderson&rft.au=C.%20J.%20Gantzer&rft.au=E.%20E.%20Alberts&rft.date=2004&rft.pages=1386-1393&rft.spage=1386&rft.epage=1393","eppi-reviewer4","❓ Multiple DOI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Odonates require healthy waterbodies for their larval stages and resource-rich terrestrial landscapes as adults. As such, farmland management at both local and larger landscape scales may be needed to reverse population declines. We sampled odonate adults and exuviae from lowland farmland ponds in England, to investigate relationships between odonate species richness and surrounding land-use. The more mobile dragonflies (Anisoptera) were influenced most strongly by landscape variables at the largest scale (i.e. 1600 m radius), while less mobile damselflies (Zygoptera) were affected by variables at more local scales (i.e. 100/400 m radii). A greater number of landscape variables affected exuvial species richness compared to adult species richness. Exuvial species richness was higher when 2 m wide cross-compliance buffer strips around ponds were present. However, no ponds in the study had buffer strips that were established through England's basic agri-environment scheme (Entry Level Scheme: ELS) agreements, and we observed a negative relationship between ELS area and exuvial species richness. Exuvial species richness increased with the amount of water, but not the number of ponds, in the landscape surrounding a focal pond. The observed odonate responses to local and surrounding land-use lend support to the development of agri-environment scheme policies that encourage landscape-scale, as well as local, scheme implementation and management. We predict that both landscape-scale and quality-targeted management of farmland ponds would benefit odonates, irrespective of mobility level and life-stage. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Among the specific objectives of the project, there was the determination of change in the composition of the microbial populations of soil of the wooded riparian strip. The composition of the bacterial communities collected at different depths inside and outside the riparian strip was determined by combined approaches involving cultivation (CFU), microscopic approaches (CTC test), and DNA-based techniques (ARDRA and DGGE). The size of the living population was the same inside and outside the experimental strip, with a minor percentage of culturable bacteria. Higher numbers of metabolically active bacteria and higher bacterial diversity were detected in the internal soil, with deeper soil layers showing reduced diversity, thus indicating that soil management within the riparian strip effectively supports the viability of bacterial communities. Total operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and percentage of single OTUs were also found to be always higher in the internal soil samples for all soil layers, with the percentage of Firmicutes increasing and Actinobacteria decreasing with depth. The increasing soil organic carbon inputs due to the contribution of the growing plants were found to support bacterial diversity in all soil layers. DNA-based analysis also indicated a clear effect of the applied treatments on soil bacterial diversity and a well-defined separation of the bacterial communities related to the different soil layers of the riparian strip.","2014","2020-10-29 20:14:25","2020-10-29 20:14:25","","25-35","","","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We then use the choice experiment method to examine public preferences for three landscape features - hedgerows, farm buildings and scrubland - in the Monts d'Arrée region (in Brittany, France), in the context of re-design of landscape conservation policy by the local environmental institute. Surveys were undertaken on two user groups, visitors and local residents. Our objective was to obtain empirical evidence of the difference between the preferences of tourists and residents, for landscape attributes. We then analysed the welfare changes of tourists and residents affected by different landscape programmes. Our results point out the strong divergence between the landscape preferences of the public and those of local public actors. The comparison of the estimated values of willingness to pay for single-attribute landscaping action shows some divergence between residents' and tourists' ranking of preferences for agricultural landscape areas. Finally, we find, at least for the socio-economic context examined in this study, that apart from its social, cultural and aesthetic values, rural landscape has economic values, and that agricultural landscape preservation tends to be more beneficial to low-income social groups. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

These natural enemies of pest species often need a greater diversity of resources than the crops themselves provide. In intensive farm management the numbers of these beneficial arthropod species may be constrained by a lack of additional prey, floral resources or suitable overwintering sites. While previous studies have indicated that targeted field margin management can positively influence the population dynamics of beneficial insects, the relative contribution of the various resources provided by these targeted margins remains unclear.To help optimise field margins for conservation biological control, this study assessed the relative contribution of three key resources; aphid prey, floral resources, and grass overwintering sites, in supporting natural enemies of cereal aphids within an agricultural landscape. Trial plots were managed adjacent to wheat fields within agro-ecosystems in the UK to assess the relative importance of these three resources in isolation and in combination. The abundance of aphidophagous natural enemies was monitored with respect to these resources during two periods; prior to cereal aphid infestation in the crop, and during the infestation period. In addition, the abundance of cereal aphids and natural enemies was monitored in the crop next to the trial plots during the infestation period. The results show that resource needs of natural enemies vary both over time and between natural enemy groups. Some predators benefited from higher aphid abundance, particularly in combination with the availability of floral resources. Floral resources had the greatest individual effect in increasing natural enemy abundance, both prior to and during periods of aphid infestation. Grassy overwintering habitat provided little overall benefit during the two study periods.In the UK, most non-crop habitat in agro-ecosystems is grass dominated winter habitat. Few Stewardship scheme initiatives are designed to provide suitable floral resources targeting natural enemies of crop pests, or to provide suitable additional prey. Given the importance of floral resources to the majority of natural enemies, providing suitable nectar and pollen sources represents the greatest opportunity for enhancing naturally occurring predators and parasitoids in agro-ecosystems.

Displacement and speed of Pterostichus melanarius, Carabus auratus and Poecilus spp. were higher in the crops than in the grassy strips, except for the speed of C. auratus. Among the four species C. auratus, P. melanarius, Pterostichus niger, and Poecilus spp., C. auratus revealed the highest displacement and speed, whereas no significant differences were found between the other three species. P. melanarius showed higher displacement and speed in wheat than in red-clover or pumpkin. Speed and displacement of P. melanarius differed between spring and autumn generations in wheat or red-clover. When they were released at a junction of arable crop and field strips, C. auratus moved indifferently to either arable field or field margins/strips, whereas P. melanarius moved directly to crop centres. At the field margin, Poecilus spp. preferred to move along a grassy strip, while it moved irrespective from the grassy strips in a central site. C. nemoralis and P. niger preferred to move within the grassy strips. Our studies reveal that grassy strips do not affect the dispersal of typical arable field species; however, the species demanding grass vegetation can only overcome the barriers of arable fields either by grassy strips alone or by grassy strips with an adjacent hedge.","2014","2020-10-29 20:14:29","2021-10-19 13:14:28","","457-467","","","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://www.crossref.org/openurl?pid=zoteroDOI@wiernik.org&url_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fzotero.org%3A2&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=Movement%20of%20carabids%20from%20grassy%20strips%20to%20crop%20land%20in%20organic%20agriculture&rft.jtitle=Journal%20of%20Insect%20Conservation&rft.volume=18&rft.aufirst=M.%20H.&rft.aulast=Ranjha&rft.au=M.%20H.%20Ranjha&rft.au=U.%20Irmler&rft.date=2014&rft.pages=457-467&rft.spage=457&rft.epage=467&rft.issn=1366-638X","eppi-reviewer4","❓ Multiple DOI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Non-point source contamination of agricultural pesticides is widely acknowledged as one of the most important anthropogenic stressors in stream ecosystems. We surveyed the occurrence of 31 pesticides and evaluated their potential toxicity for benthic macroinvertebrates using Toxic Units (TU) in 14 Danish 1st-and 2nd-order streams in bed sediments and stream water during storm flow and base flow. Total pesticide concentrations and toxic potential were highest during storm flow events with maximum TU ranging from -6.63 to -1.72. We found that minimum buffer strip width in the near upstream area was the most important parameter governing TU. Furthermore, adding a function for minimum buffer strip width to the Runoff Potential (RP) model increased its power to predict measured TUs from 46% to 64%. However, including a function for tile drainage capacity is probably equally important and should be considered in future research in order to further optimise the RP model. Our results clearly emphasise the importance of considering buffer strips as risk mitigation tools in terms of non-point source pesticide contamination. We furthermore apply our results for discussing the minimum dimensions that vegetated buffer strips should have in order to sufficiently protect stream ecosystems from pesticide contamination and maintain good ecological status.

We measured bulk density, air permeability and precompression stress in a clay soil (Vertic Cambisol) and a sandy loam (Haplic Regosol) in Finland, to identify management-related changes in the physical and mechanical properties in the surface soil of buffer zones. In addition, the impact of texture on these properties was studied at depths down to 180-200 cm. Soil cores (240 cm(3)) were sampled from a cultivated field, from buffer zones harvested by grazing (only in a clay soil) or by cutting and removing the vegetation, and from buffer zones covered with natural grass vegetation. The samples were equilibrated at a matric potential of -6 kPa and compressed at a normal stress range of 20-400 kPa (7 h), followed by stress removal (1 h). Generally, the clay soil was more compressible than the sandy loam. Due to trampling by cattle, the young grazed buffer zone (0-3 cm) had the largest bulk density and the smallest total porosity. For the grazed sites, reduced air permeability (2.7-5.1 x 10(-5) m s(-1)) was found, compared with that of the buffer zone under natural vegetation (15-22 x 10(-5) m s(-1)), indicating decreased pore continuity. Although the old grazed site was easily compressed, compared with the younger site, it showed a greater resilience capacity due to the protective cover of organic residues accumulated on the soil surface.","2010","2020-10-29 20:14:34","2021-10-19 13:13:42","","160-172","","","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, farmers frequently view these areas as non-productive and as potential sources of weeds, insect pests and diseases. Weed species richness and abundance were examined in crop fields in 2002-2003 at the Center for Environmental Farming Systems near Goldsboro, NC to determine if crop field weed infestation was associated with field margin management (managed versus unmanaged). Weed species abundance and richness were measured over two growing seasons on four occasions in crop fields along permanent transects that extended from the field edge toward the center of the field. The presence/absence of data for all plant species in the field margin was also recorded. For both margin types, managed and unmanaged, more weeds were found near the field edge than in the center of the field. Weed species richness was slightly higher in cropland bordering managed margins than in cropland along unmanaged margins. Several significant interactions led to an examination of nine dominant weed species in each field margin type and their distribution in crop fields. When all sampling dates were pooled, only 42 (40%) of 105 species identified in the field margins were observed in the crop field. Managed margins had lower species richness than unmanaged field margins-less than half the mean number of species (15 versus 6 species, respectively). Contingency table analysis did not reveal any association between plant species occurring in the margin and those found in the crop field. Furthermore, margin type and weed presence in the field margin were not effective predictors of weed occurrence in the crop field as determined by logistic regression.","2011","2020-10-29 20:14:38","2021-10-19 13:14:10","","127-136","","","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of pre-applied polyacrylamide (PAM) or chitosan to trap particulate phosphorus (PP) and P-sorbing potable water treatment alum residue (PWTR) to enhance vegetative filtering effects is examined here using field and laboratory overland flow simulation (flows from 0.43 to 0.34 litres s(-1) (m width)(-1)) and analysis. Fitted equations suggest that up to 40% of dissolved reactive P applied (0.75 mg P litre(-1)) in overland flow could be captured in a flow length of 2.1 m (1 kg PWTR m(-2)). Unfortunately, drying decreased PWTR effectiveness, though little of the P captured was readily desorbed. This effect did not appear to be the result of gibbsite formation. Compared with the other treatments, there was a strong treatment effect of pre-applied PAM on the change in PP losses (P < 0.001) over time, though evidence suggests the PAM effect declined during a 44 minute flow period. We showed that the investigated two-pronged approach to the enhancement of the effectiveness of P trapping by pasture had limitations. Laboratory sheet-flow simulations suggest that a field-stable P sorber with sorption characteristics similar to those of the un-dried PWTR could be an effective retention enhancer for dissolved P. Pre-applied PAM can have an effect on particulate-P trapping but was rapidly dissolved and removed by flow.","2008","2020-10-29 20:14:38","2021-10-19 13:13:54","","257-264","","","59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Variability in P-yield was most closely correlated with characteristics of the riparian buffer, such as percent wetland land cover, riparian continuity, and stream sinuosity. During the most extreme events, mean P-yield was negatively correlated with the percentage of wetland land cover in the upland watershed.

In 2002 and 2003, the butterfly community in filter strips of a variety of widths and vegetative compositions was studied. Transect surveys were used to quantify butterfly abundance and diversity and measured vegetative variables in conjunction with each butterfly survey round. Overall butterfly diversity (H′) and abundance of habitat-sensitive butterflies were positively correlated with filter strip width. Using stepwise regression, the best models to explain butterfly abundance included the coverage of forbs and the number of ramets in bloom in the strips, and indicated positive relationships between forbs and the butterfly community (R 2 =0.33 and 0.07, respectively). The models that best explained abundances of large, habitat-sensitive butterflies included the height and vertical density of vegetation. The planting of forbs in filter strips is rare, but may be useful for providing food sources to butterflies.

Strong support was found for thresholds in margin width below which vole abundance was extremely low. Narrow margins were male biased with individuals moving greater distances and a large proportion of males behaved as transient individuals. However, no effect was observed on the age structure or survival of the population. Individuals were able to compensate for the lack of habitat through alterations in their behaviour sufficiently to maintain their survival. Within intensive agro-ecosystems, narrow strips between crops are important links for voles between wider margins and, if available, other more suitable habitats. Maintenance of narrow margins, along with larger areas of suitable habitat, is therefore effective in farmed landscapes for sustaining populations of specialist species where they show sufficient flexibility.

Small mammals were trapped and their ecto-parasites removed in 14 field margins of varying widths over 2 years in a highly fragmented.agro-ecosystem. No evidence to suggest the presence of a threshold in parasite prevalence was found, which may be due to the high rate of host movement and transiency within the system. Contrary to expectation, the probability of infestation decreased with host abundance and the abundance of alternative hosts, suggesting a dilution effect. The relatively long life cycle of small mammal specialist tick and flea species present under the prevailing environmental conditions may have left the parasites unable to keep up with the rate of reproduction and dispersal of the host. It is important to consider changes in the behaviour of the host and the presence of alternative hosts when predicting the effects of habitat fragmentation on disease spread.

Extent and location of the clustering of diapausing larval codling moth were first assessed in each orchard. The between year differences in clustering patterns were then checked. The relation of clustering patterns to characteristics of neighbouring hedgerow was finally tested. Clustering was detected in 16 orchards out of 53 (30.2%) in 2006, in 10 orchards out of 50 (20%) in 2007, and in 13 orchards out of 40 (32.5%) in 2008. The clustering pattern was generally similar between years. There was a consistent influence of neighbouring hedgerows on the spatial distribution of individuals. The number of larvae was lower – depending on the year – in areas either closest to hedgerows or under the influence of hedgerow shadow or wind protection depending on the year. Further, in one of the years, the number of larvae was negatively correlated with the floral diversity of the nearby hedgerow. This study suggests that hedgerows influence codling moth population dynamics and may play a key role in reducing the abundance of this species within orchards.

As independent variables, we took both characteristics of focus orchards (pear vs. apple, organic vs. conventional orchards) and of their surrounding landscape (orchard density and hedgerow network attributes) into account in buffers with widths varying from 50 to 500 m. Although the codling moth is specialised on orchards, the number of codling moths was lower in orchards within a high orchard density area. There was some indication that this effect was mostly due to the density of conventional orchards and thus to the intensity of insecticide treatments. Conversely, we found no particular effect of abandoned or organic orchards. In 2006, the number of codling moths was also significantly lower in a focus orchard when the hedgerow network acted as a protection against the prevailing wind. Finally, major effects of landscape variables on the number of codling moths were observed for distances of less than 150 m from the focus orchards, suggesting that codling moth management should be organised over areas of about 16 ha.","2009","2020-10-29 20:14:43","2020-11-06 22:49:24","","337-349","","","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Field borders can increase and enhance early-succession habitat for birds on farmland. However, field border shape and the landscape context in which field borders are established may determine their effectiveness for bird conservation. We established linear and nonlinear field borders on farms in agriculture-dominated and forest-dominated landscapes in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina. We collected pre-treatment data on songbird density, nest success, brood parasitism frequency, summer bobwhite abundance, and fall bobwhite covey abundance in 2004. After field border establishment (2005 and 2006), we continued to collect these data as well as data on artificial bobwhite nest success and field border vegetation characteristics. After the establishment of field borders, summer bobwhite abundance increased significantly on farms in agriculture-dominated landscapes and on farms with nonlinear field borders. Summer bobwhite abundance did not increase on farms in forest-dominated landscapes with linear field borders. Artificial bobwhite nest depredation rates were similar across all treatments, as were the major vegetation characteristics of the field borders themselves. Fall covey abundance, songbird density, nest success, and brood parasitism frequency were unaffected by the establishment of field borders. However, songbird density and nest success were significantly higher in agriculture-dominated landscapes. Our results suggest that linear and nonlinear field borders can be used to increase bobwhite populations on farms in agriculture-dominated landscapes. Nonlinear field borders can be used to increase bobwhite populations in forest-dominated landscapes. The same landscapes that were most conducive to bobwhite management were also the highest quality for songbirds. We compared the time-of-detection method for sampling bobwhite coveys with an empirical logistic regression method. The time-of-detection method provided an estimate of detection probability that was similar to the empirical method. The time-of-detection method is less expensive to perform than the empirical method. However, the empirical method may be more useful when the number of covey detections is low, and it can use information from a single count to calculate the detection probability for that count.","2007","2020-10-29 20:14:45","2020-11-06 22:49:13","","","109","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9780549378921","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Field borders have been promoted as an important component of conservation plans to reverse this decline. Field border characteristics, such as shape and the landscapes in which the borders are established, have the potential to influence their effectiveness for recovering northern bobwhite populations. We established narrow linear (approx. 3-m-wide) and nonlinear field borders on farms in agriculture-dominated and forest-dominated landscapes in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, USA, after collecting pretreatment data on summer bobwhite abundance. After establishment of field borders, summer bobwhite abundance nearly doubled on farms in agriculture-dominated landscapes and increased approximately 57% on farms with nonlinear field borders. Summer bobwhite abundance did not increase on farms with linear field borders in forest-dominated landscapes. Nonlinear and narrow linear field borders can be used to increase bobwhite numbers on farms in landscapes dominated by agriculture. Less flexibility exists in forest-dominated landscapes, where we found only nonlinear field borders resulted in an increase.

Six of the sites received agricultural runoff directly via culverts and drainage ditches (non-buffered sites) and six sites were protected from agricultural runoff by a vegetated buffer (buffered sites). Mean total number of aquatic macroinvertebrates were significantly greater (p < 0.001) for buffered sites (230 +/- 44 standard error) than non-buffered sites (97 +/- 24). Water from non-buffered sites had significantly greater turbidity, conductivity, and concentrations of chlorophyll alpha and atrazine than buffered sites in addition to consistently greater annual averages of total nitrogen and total phosphorus. Furthermore, sediments from non-buffered sites had significantly greater cadmium, potassium, sodium and zinc than buffered sites. Use of vegetative buffers to intercept direct row-crop runoff can improve water quality and aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity and abundance in Rainwater Basin wetlands.","2013","2020-10-29 20:14:48","2020-10-29 20:14:48","","1025-1036","","","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The behaviour of two butterfly species, a habitat specialist (Speyeria idalia) and a habitat generalist (Danaus plexippus), was tracked at four prairie edges to determine the extent to which edges act as a barrier to emigration. The four edge types studied were crop, road, field and treeline. The edges differed in structure ranging from high-contrast (treeline) to low-contrast (field). 2. S. idalia, the habitat specialist, responded strongly to all edges, even those with low structural contrast. However, S. idalia's response was strongly affected by conspecific density at crop and field edges; individuals were less likely to exit from high density plots, S. idalia responded to edges both by turning to avoid crossing them, and returning to the plot if they had crossed. 3. D. plexippus responded strongly only to treeline edges. Wind direction and time of year were important factors influencing behaviour at edges for this species. Conspecific density was not a significant factor affecting their behaviour. D. plexippus responded to edges by not crossing them, but rarely returned once they had crossed. 4. In highly fragmented landscapes, such as the one in which this study occurred, butterflies which show little or no response to edges may exhibit high emigration rates because of the high probability of encountering an edge in small habitat patches. Butterflies may respond strongly to even subtle habitat boundaries, but those responses may be modified by the edge structure, local environment or other conditions. Therefore, modifying edge structure may be a way to influence emigration rates, making it a useful tool for conservation.","2001","2020-10-29 20:14:49","2020-10-29 20:14:49","","840-852","","","70","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effects of windbreak on maize yields have not been assessed in a well-documented manner in eastern Canada, which is a major influential barrier limiting their adoption by farmers. In this study, we investigated the spatial distribution of maize grain yield in the leeward side of mature (average age, 30-years-old) single-tree row windbreaks that were located on four farm sites in southern Quebec, Canada. We determined whether the sign and magnitude of windbreak effects on spatial patterns of maize yield varied across contrasting years with respect to rainfall conditions. The greatest yield variation was observed at the tree-crop interface (within 0.5-1H, where H = tree height), where substantial yield reductions occurred. In two sites, the magnitude of negative windbreak effects on maize yield at the tree-crop interface decreases in the wetter years. We found important maize yield variation among sampling positions between 2H and 20H (here considered as the shelter zone), with yield values often significantly higher than at 24H (here considered as a control zone with negligible tree shelter effects). The magnitude of this yield variation in the shelter zone generally decreased in the wetter years. In most cases, we estimated that the net effect of windbreak on maize yield (0.5-20H vs. 24H) was negligible. Significant net positive (16 %) or negative (-6 %) effects of windbreaks on maize production were found at one site only and occurred on two different years. We conclude that the sign and magnitude of windbreak effects on spatial patterns of maize grain vary considerably across farms and depend upon temporal variation in rainfall conditions in eastern Canada.","2015","2020-10-29 20:14:49","2021-10-19 13:14:20","","237-246","","","89","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most differences were in the tilled area, with fewer smaller effects mirroring them in the verge and boundary. In spring oilseed rape fields, the cover, flowering and seeding of plants were 25%, 44% and 39% lower, respectively, in the GMHT uncropped tilled margins.

For maize, the effect was reversed, with plant cover and flowering 28% and 67% greater, respectively, in the GMHT half. Effects on butterflies mirrored these vegetation effects, with 24% fewer butterflies in margins of GMHT spring oilseed rape. The likely cause is the lower nectar supply in GMHT tilled margins and crop edges. Few large treatment differences were found for bees, gastropods or other invertebrates.

Species of particular conservation interest that could benefit from connecting habitats especially in agroecosystems are native forest herbs. It is still unclear, however, which hedgerow habitats have the best potential of supporting diverse forest herb communities, making it hard to target particular structures for conservation. Our objective was to identify the local and landscape characteristics of hedgerows that could help predict their potential at maximizing the richness, abundance, and diversity of native forest herbs of temperate deciduous forests of North-East America. We used multiple regression, Moran’I correlograms, and conditional autoregressive models to assess the effect of landscape and historical variables (hedgerow age, amount of adjacent forest cover, connection to forests and other hedgerows) and of local variables (hedgerow width, canopy cover, cover of other species) on the response variables. The results show an increase in forest herb diversity and abundance in hedgerows with time and with increasing nearby forest cover. Local factors such as greater width and reduced cover of other species also relate to a greater abundance and diversity of forest herbs in linear habitats. The fact that forest herb communities can reassemble in hedgerow corridors with time implies that there could be long-term benefits in maintaining and even creating linear habitats where there is a pool of dispersing forest herbs.

Evapotranspiration rates, surface runoff and percolation of water across a soil profile are controlled by shelterbelts. The heat transfers from cultivated fields to shelterbelts by advection processes enhance evapotranspiration rates from trees. Depth of groundwater table and thermal conditions have important bearing on the uptake of groundwater by trees. The studies showed that in the Turew agricultural landscape, located near Poznan, Poland, shelterbelts use for evapotranspiration 40 percent more water than cultivated fields. For air heating cultivated fields use 280 percent of solar energy more than shelterbelts. The shelterbelts limit N-NO3− spreading with groundwater very effectively. Concentrations of inflowing nitrates with groundwater dropped to 2.3–24.4 percent of the input from fields. In contrast to nitrate ions the ammonium behave entirely different. Often concentration of ammonium increased in groundwater under shelterbelts. Higher concentrations of N-NH4+ under shelterbelts than under field indicated that ammonium ions were released during decomposition of organic matter. This supposition was directly proved by estimates of very high rates of urease activity which enzyme converts urea nitrogen into NH3 in the final stages of protein decomposition. It was estimated that N2O fluxes from soil of shelterbelts are much smaller than from cultivated fields. The balance of nitrogen inputs and outputs in a shelterbelt indicated that the internal recycling of this element is of crucial importance for the controlling efficiency of nitrogen compounds spreading in an environment.

The sites also had a wide range of nitrate inputs, soil characteristics, and vegetation types. Dissolved forms of N in groundwater and associated hydrological parameters were measured at all sites; these data were used to calculate nitrate removal by the riparian buffers. Nitrate removal rates (expressed as the difference between the input and output nitrate concentration in relation to the width of the riparian zone) were mainly positive, ranging from 5% m(-1) to 30% m(-1), except for a few sites where the values were close to zero. Average N removal rates were similar for herbaceous (4.43% m(-1)) and forested (4.21% m(-1)) sites. Nitrogen removal efficiency was not affected by climatic variation between sites, and no significant seasonal pattern was detected. When nitrate inputs were low, a very large range of nitrate removal efficiencies was found both in the forested and in the nonforested sites. However, sites receiving nitrate inputs above 5 mg N L-1 showed an exponential negative decay of nitrate removal efficiency (nitrate removal efficiency = 33.6 e(-0.11) (NO3,) (input), r(2) = 0.33, P < 0.001). Hydraulic gradient was also negatively related to nitrate removal (r = -0.27, P < 0.05) at these sites. On the basis of this intersite comparison, we conclude that the removal of nitrate by biological mechanisms (for example, denitrification, plant uptake) in the riparian areas is related more closely to nitrate load and hydraulic gradient than to climatic parameters.","2003","2020-10-29 20:14:55","2021-10-19 13:14:30","","20-30","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Water samples for the NO3-N and NH3-N measurements were collected between June 2012 and August 2014 in observation wells located at the inlet (input) and outlet (output) of each treatment. The analyses showed that vegetated BS had NO3-N removal efficiency ranging from 33 to 67 % (mean 52 %), with the G treatment showing the best performance in reducing NO3-N concentrations in subsurface lateral flow. The BS treatments were not effective in reducing NH3-N concentrations. The results suggested that N uptake by grass is the main process associated with the NO3-N retention capacity of vegetated BS.","2015","2020-10-29 20:14:56","2021-10-19 13:14:17","","359-370","","","102","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Loss of hedgerows can produce changes in environmental conditions that can be especially critical in summer, corresponding with the dry period in Mediterranean ecosystems. In order to show the effects of hedgerow removal on summer Mediterranean environmental conditions in rural landscapes, this paper describes a comparison of some key environmental conditions between areas where hedgerows are still present, compared to areas where they have been removed. Through a two-way ANOVA, it was found that temperatures in the hedgerows were significantly different from those in the fields, whilst air temperatures beneath the hedgerows were lower, and steadier, than those of surrounding areas. When temperatures of the fields were compared to those sites where hedgerows had been removed, significant differences in temperatures were detected below-ground and sometimes at soil surface level but not at higher levels. The levels of soil water content and organic carbon were higher where hedgerows were still in place. These differences indicate potentially negative environmental impacts due to hedgerow removal. The implications of hedgerow conservation for environmental protection and for cropland productivity are discussed.","2010","2020-10-29 20:14:57","2020-10-29 20:14:57","","13-25","","","78","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We measured changes in extractable P in the soil, NO(3)-N in soil water, and changes in total reactive P and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of runoff water before and after a switchgrass filter strip. Five rates of dairy manure (target rates of 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg N ha(-1) from solid manure in 1995; 0, 75, 150, 300, and 600 Lg N ha(-1) from lagoon effluent in 1996 and 1997) were surface-applied to field plots of switchgrass (5.2 by 16.4 m) with a 5.2- by 16.4-m switchgrass filter strip below the manured area. Yield of switchgrass from the manured area increased linearly with increasing manure rate in each year. Soil water samples collected at 46 or 91 cm below the soil surface on 30 dates indicated <3 mg L(-1) of NO(3)-N in all plots.

Positive relationship between landscape complexity and biological pest control is now well known and is assumed to mainly come from the fact that natural enemies use semi-natural habitats for overwintering. However, the respective role of each type of semi-natural habitats in the landscape in shaping natural enemy communities and pest control remains poorly studied. Moreover, the relative importance of environmental variables in structuring these communities remains largely unexplored. The main purpose of this study was to provide an insight into the types of SNH natural enemies use for overwintering as well as the effects of local and landscape characteristics in structuring their overwintering communities. Overwintering natural enemy communities were sampled in 7 types of SNH (i.e., forest interior (FI), South-facing forest edge (FES), North-facing forest edge (FEN), dry unmanaged grassland (UGD), wet unmanaged grassland (UGW), managed grass strip (CAP grass strip) either dominated by monocotyledonous plants (MGM) or by dicotyledonous plants (MGD)). Abundance, species richness as well as community composition of each group of enemies were then explained by local and landscape parameters to assess their relative importance. In our study, overwintering natural enemy communities differed markedly among types of SNH. Explanatory variables proved to have a decreasing influence in shaping natural enemy community compositions from the local (i.e. in the emergence trap perimeter, in 3 m- and 15 m-radius circular zones around it) to the immediat landscape (within 30 m- and 60 m-radius circular zones) and then the mid-distant one (within 120 m-, 250 m- and 500 m-radius circular zones). We particularly found that management intensity and vegetation height were very strong drivers of natural enemy diversity at the local scale. Managed CAP grass strips turned out as the main source habitat of beneficials in the spring while forests acted quite negatively on local abundances of most of the beneficials studied. On the opposite, medium arable land and grassland surface areas proved to be favourable for them as a whole in the immediat landscape, while in the mid-distant landscape, fallows favoured aphidophagous hoverflies and arable lands did so for spiders. Our results highlight the need for a more precise description of SNH in the landscape if we are to mechanistically understand the role of compositional landscape heterogeneity on zoophagous arthropod populations and to give relevant guidelines to design landscapes favouring natural biological pest control.

The assemblage of carabid beetles was highly diverse, consisting of 75 species. Carabid activity-density was low in the boundary compared to the field. Within the field, it was highest at the edge and decreased towards the field centre. Species richness, standardized to the number of individuals, did not differ between sampling locations. Based on the within-field distribution three ecological groups of carabids were distinguished: (i) boundary species; (ii) field-interior species and (iii) field-edge species.

The objective of this study was to quantify C stored in surface soil layers and tree litter within and adjacent to a 35-year-old shelterbelt in eastern Nebraska, USA. The 2-row shelterbelt was composed of eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) and scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris). A sampling grid was established across a section of the shelterbelt on Tomek silt loam (fine, smectitic, mesic Pachic Argiudolls). Four soil cores were collected at each grid point, divided into 0-7.5 and 7.5-15 cm depth increments, and composited by depth. Soil samples were analyzed for total, organic, and inorganic C, total N, texture, pH, and nutrient content. Under the shelterbelt, all surface litter in a 0.5 × 0.5 m2 area at each grid point was collected prior to soil sampling, dried, weighed, sorted, and analyzed for total C and N. Average soil organic carbon (SOC) in the 0-15 cm layer within the shelterbelt (3,994 g m-2) was significantly greater than in the cultivated fields (3,623 g m-2). The tree litter contained an additional ∼1,300 g C m-2. Patterns of litter mass and soil pH and texture suggested increased organic inputs by tree litter and deposition of wind-blown sediment may be responsible for greater SOC beneath the shelterbelt. Further research is needed to identify the mechanism(s) responsible for the observed patterns of SOC within and adjacent to the shelterbelt and to quantify the C in biomass and deeper soil layers. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","2007","2020-10-29 20:15:00","2021-10-19 13:14:42","","163-174","","","71","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this investigation, we tested the effect of agricultural practices and local landscape on wireworm damage in maize crops. We surveyed wireworm damage in 341 fields under various conditions in western France in 2011 and 2012. We used in particular a random forest algorithm to impute missing values and an automated model selection routine to select the best beta regression model. Our results show that the occurrence of grassland in the rotation increases wireworm damage. Tillage also shows a high influence, though varying with season and year. Wireworm damage is decreased by the presence of hedges or cultivated crops at the field border, whereas it is increased by the presence of grassland at the field border. Overall, our findings provide some insights to develop preventive solutions for the sustainable control of wireworms, as well as a framework for data processing to analyze a wide range of similar situations involving other crops and pests.","2015","2020-10-29 20:15:00","2021-10-19 13:14:21","","793-802","","","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Enhancing floral resources is a widely accepted measure for promoting bees in agricultural landscapes, but effectiveness varies considerably between landscapes and regions. We hypothesize that this variation is mainly driven by a combination of the direct effects of measures on local floral resources and the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape. To test this, we established wildflower strips in four European countries, using the same seed mixture of forage plants specifically targeted at bees. We used a before-after control-impact approach to analyse the impacts of wildflower strips on bumblebees, solitary bees and Red List species and examined to what extent effects were affected by local and landscape-wide floral resource availability, land-use intensity and landscape complexity. Wildflower strips generally enhanced local bee abundance and richness, including Red-listed species. Effectiveness of the wildflower strips increased with the local contrast in flower richness created by the strips and furthermore depended on the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape, with different patterns for solitary bees and bumblebees. Effects on solitary bees appeared to decrease with increasing amount of late-season alternative floralresources in the landscape, whereas effects on bumblebees increased with increasing early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability.Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the effects of wildflower strips on bees are largely driven by the extent to which local flower richness is increased. The effectiveness of this measure could therefore be enhanced by maximizing the number of bee forage species in seed mixtures, and by management regimes that effectively maintain flower richness in the strips through the years. In addition, for bumblebees specifically, our study highlights the importance of a continuous supply of food resources throughout the season. Measures that enhance early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability, such as the cultivation of oilseed rape, can benefit bumblebees by providing the essential resources for colony establishment and growth in spring. Further research is required to determine whether, and under what conditions, wildflower strips result in actual population-level effects.

Here, the impact of SWA on spider density, diversity and species richness in winter wheat fields was studied. Edge effects and field scale effects of SWA were compared with landscape effects of perennial habitats in general. Adjoining SWA enhanced the densities of crab spiders (Thomisidae), ground spiders (Gnaphosidae), wolf spiders (Lycosidae) and young orb weavers (Araneidae) in wheat fields. In addition, numbers of wolf spiders and ground spiders increased towards field edges. Surprisingly, species richness was unaffected by SWA. Species richness, Simpson diversity, and densities of all spiders, and densities of sheetweb spiders (Linyphiidae) increased with the percentage of perennial habitats in 1.5km radius. In conclusion, high spider diversity in wheat fields depends on perennial habitats at the landscape scale. To enhance cursorial spider families and orb weavers, SWA should be interspersed between crop fields.

Filter strips 7.5 and 15 m,vide downslope greatly reduced concentrations of sediment in runoff (76-93%) and contaminants strongly associated,with sediment (total P, 55-79%; permethrin, 27-83% [(3-phenoxyphenyl) methyl (+/-)-cis, trans-3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate]).

Adjacent land use potentially has an important influence on the species composition of hedgerows. In the Mediterranean region, hedgerows are considered as remnants of past practices and their function may be linked with the prevailing agrarian systems, in turn related to societal change. In this paper, the characteristics of hedgerows in Central Spain, and their interactions with adjacent fields were studied in order to understand their contribution to maintaining woody plant species richness in the cultural landscape. The hedgerow typology of the region were found to respond jointly both to environmental and livestock farming-related variations in adjacent land uses. The variation in the management intensity of the landscape is reflected in the composition of the woody plant species of hedgerows, varying from species of open landscape to woodland species. Moderate degrees of grazing allow for higher values of woody plant richness in hedgerows compared with those hedgerows separating systems subjected to a higher livestock loads or to abandonment processes. Thus, hedgerows potentially contribute to the functionality of these cultural landscapes and provide a basis of important ecological and historical value in landscape conservation planning. These conclusions have important implications in the development of landscape conservation and protection policies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on this tool, 19.3% of 176 collected soil samples were tested positive for Metarhizium clade 1. The densities of Metarhizium clade 1 were heterogeneously distributed among the soil samples and differed significantly among sampled areas as well as sites. Despite this heterogeneity significant habitat-specific associations were observed. High Metarhizium clade 1 densities were found in soil samples collected from low-input permanent grassland and improved field margins indicating that both semi-natural habitat types may provide potential refuges for Metarhizium clade 1 species. Based on these results, more detailed analyses can be performed in permanent grassland and improved field margins to identify factors, which may promote the natural occurrence of Metarhizium clade 1 species and improve their function as natural regulator of pest insect populations.

Ground water was sampled at varying distances from the field edge to determine an effective width for maximum nitrate attenuation. Ground water samples were analyzed for nitrate concentrations as well as chloride concentrations, which were used as a conservative ion to assess dilution or concentration effects within the riparian zone. Significant nitrate reductions occurred in both the cane and the forest riparian buffer zones within the first 3.3 m, a relatively narrow width. In this first 3.3 m, the cane and forest buffer reduced ground water nitrate levels by 90 percent and 61 percent, respectively. Approximately 40 percent of the observed 99 percent nitrate reduction over the 10 m cane buffer could be attributed to dilution by upwelling ground water. Neither ground water dilution nor concentration was observed in the forest buffer. The ground water nitrate attenuation capabilities of the cane and-forest riparian zones were not statistically different. During the-spring, both plant assimilation and denitrification were. probably important nitrate loss mechanisms, while in the summer nitrate was more likely lost via table dropped below the rooting denitrification since the water zone.","2003","2020-10-29 20:15:05","2021-10-19 13:14:05","","347-354","","","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A field scale study was conducted to assess the ability of remnant giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea (Walt.)

Two adjacent, 10.0 m wide riparian buffers were instrumented with 16 overland flow collectors to monitor surface runoff for nitrate, ammonium, and orthophosphate.

The forest buffer significantly reduced incoming dissolved nitrate-N, dissolved ammonium-N, total ammonium-N, and total orthophosphate masses in surface runoff by 97, 74, 68, and 78 , respectively within the 10.0 m riparian buffer. Nutrient reductions within the cane buffer were 100 for all three nutrients due to relatively high infiltration rates. Significant reductions of total ammonium- N and total orthophosphate were detected by 3.3 m in the cane buffer and at 6.6 m in the forest buffer.

No detectable reductions occurred during the spring in the forested buffer. Reductions in sediment concentrations were less evident compared to mass basis, indicating that infiltration may be a more important sediment reduction mechanism than particle settling.

The objectives of this study were to determine the phosphorus (P)-sorption characteristics of the surface soil in a 13-year-old CRP buffer and an adjacent continuously cropped production area from which the buffer was created and to assess differences in P-sorption maxima and P-buffering capacity between the sites. Phosphorus sorption was modeled with both the simple Langmuir and the two-surface Langmuir equations. There were significant differences in all P-sorption parameters between the cropped area and the buffer over most of the depth increments studied. The cropped area soil had higher sorption max (Smax), binding energy (k), and P equilibrium buffering capacity (PEBC) than the buffer soil. However, the buffer had higher equilibrium P concentration (EPC). These findings imply that it may not be appropriate to assume that a buffer will act as a P sink simply because it is not receiving P fertilization. Any assessment of buffer or filter strip effectiveness for P retention should include an examination of the P-sorption properties of the soils present.","2008","2020-10-29 20:15:07","2020-10-29 20:15:07","","2961-2970","","","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bear Creek, is typical of many streams in Central Iowa where the primary land use along the stream's length is row crop (corn and soybeans) production agriculture or intensive riparian zone grazing. The Bear Creek watershed is long (-35 km), narrow (3-6 km), and drains 7,661 ha of farmland. The MSRBS system is a 20 m wide filter strip consisting of four or five rows of fast-growing trees planted closest to the stream, then two shrub rows, and finally a 7 m wide strip of switchgrass established next to the agricultural fields. The 1.0 km long system is located on an operational farm and is laid out in a split block design on both sides of Bear Creek. An integral part of this system is a streambank stabilization soil bioengineering component and a constructed wetland to intercept NPS pollutants in field drainage tile water flow. It is hypothesized that this system will function effectively as a nutrient, pesticide, and sediment sink for NPS pollutants coming from the upslope agricultural fields. Prior to establishment of the MSRBS system, the riparian zone along Bear Creek was grazed and row cropped to the stream edge. Since 1990 there has been dramatic alteration in the appearance and functioning of this riparian zone. After four growing seasons, the fast-growing tree species (cottonwood, silver maple, willow, and green ash) range in height from 2.4 m to over 5.5 m. Mean (four-year) biomass production of silver maple was 8.4 dry Mg ha-1, more than twice to seven times the yield from other silver maple research plots in Central Iowa. The shrub species, selected because of desired wildlife benefits, have done well in terms of survival and growth with ninebark, Nannyberry vibumum and Nanking cherry doing the best. The switchgrass has developed into a dense stand that effectively stops concentrated flow from the agriculture fields and allows for infiltration rates well above the field rate. Early root biomass data indicate significantly more roots below the MSRBS than agricultural fields. This suggests better soil stabilization, absorption of infiltrated water, and soil-root-microbe-NPS pollutant interaction characteristics within the MSRBS system than the cropped fields. Nitrate-nitrogen concentrations in the MSRBS never exceed 2 mg l-1 whereas the levels in the adjacent agricultural fields exceed 12 mg l-1. The water quality data collected suggest that the MSRBS is effective in reducing NPS pollutants in the vadose and saturated zone below the system. The soil bioengineering revetments have stabilized the streambank and minimized bank collapse. Initial results (from 4 months of operation) from the constructed wetland (built in summer 1994) indicate nitrate-nitrogen concentrations of the tile inflow water gt 15 mg l-1 whereas the outflow water had a nitrate-nitrogen concentration of lt 3 mg l-1. Over time this wetland should become more effective in removing excess nitrogen moving with the tile flow from the agricultural fields because of the accumulation of organic matter from the cattails. Overall the MSRBS system seems to be functioning as expected. This MSRBS system offers farmers a way to intercept eroding soil, trap and transform NPS pollution, stabilize streambanks, provide wildlife habitat, produce biomass for on-farm use, produce high-quality hardwood in the future, and enhance the aesthetics of the agroecosystem. As a streamside best management practice (BMP), the MSRBS system complements upland BMPs and provides many valuable private and public market and non-market benefits.","1995","2020-10-29 20:15:08","2020-10-29 20:15:08","","201-226","","","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eight habitats were studied in the farm: ponds, ditches, a riparian corridor, hedgerows, and four agricultural fields (mustard, oats, fallow, and legumes). The undisturbed riparian corridor had higher soil $${\text{NO}}_{\text{3}}^ - - {\text{N}}$$ and $${\text{NH}}_4^ + - {\text{N}}$$ concentrations, and potentially mineralizable N and higher abundances of bacterivore nematodes and longer food webs. Canonical correlation analysis showed associations between habitats and nematode trophic groups: predatory and bacterial-feeding nematodes in the riparian corridor and hedgerows, omnivore nematodes in the ponds and ditches, and fungal-feeding nematodes in the legume field. Soil chemical and physical properties mirrored the aboveground farm patterns and were more similar among habitats that were or had been cultivated, compared to the riparian corridor. Soil food web indices, based on functional analysis of nematode faunal composition, reflected the aboveground landscape heterogeneity. Discriminant analysis indicated that soil food web indices separated the two most disturbed habitats (ponds and tailwater ditches) from the two least disturbed habitats (the riparian corridor and hedgerows). The indices correlated with soil functioning as inferred by soil properties. Abundance of nematode taxa was not associated with aboveground landscape patterns. The complexity of the soil food web may have been influenced by (1) environmental factors that differed between years, (2) different time periods since disturbance in the various habitats, and (3) movement of nutrients and organisms by water flow between habitats in the farmscale.

The need for agri-environmental indicators arises, at least partially, because the desired state of the environment sought by policy makers may not be directly observable. To develop agri-environmental measures favourable to landscape quality, it is necessary to know more about the relationship between landscape structure and composition and the number of different species. This study tested the relationship between the data sets of landscape elements and bumblebee communities from 11 agricultural areas in Estonia. The localities were divided into two groups: intensively used agricultural areas (IA) (the percentage of arable land was >65%) and less intensively used agricultural areas (LIA) (the percentage of arable land was <45%). The following elements of landscape structure were analysed: buffer zones narrower than 5 m and wider than 5 m, ecotones between cultivated land and broad-leaved forests, ecotones between cultivated land and mixed or coniferous forests, ditches and brooks, fallow land, mixed forests, coniferous forests, broad-leaved forests, bushes, wetlands, cultivated grasslands, pastures, legumes, arable land, semi-natural grasslands. Fifteen bumblebee species were recorded in LIA and 13 in IA. The most widely distributed and abundant species were Bombus lucorum, Bombus pascuorum and Bombus lapidarius. These species dominated in both types of agricultural area. Two species, Bombus jonellus and Bombus hypnorum were found only in LIA. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the landscape elements and the bumblebee species found. Results showed that there was a significant co-structure between the data sets of landscape elements and bumblebee communities. The most important landscape features that correlated with the distribution of the bumblebee species were the ecotone length between cultivated land and forests, and the size of the area covered with mixed forests and wetlands.

They are potentially important for wetland biodiversity but, despite their ubiquity, information on their biodiversity and management in the wider countryside is scarce. We surveyed 175 ditches for their physical and chemical characteristics, spatial connectivity, plant communities and aquatic invertebrates in an area of intensively managed farmland in Oxfordshire, UK and collected information on ditch management from farmer interviews. Water depth and shade had a small impact on the diversity of plant and invertebrate communities in ditches. Increased shade over the ditch channel resulted in reduced taxonomic richness of both channel vegetation and aquatic invertebrates and channel vegetation cover was lower at shaded sites. Invertebrate taxonomic richness was higher when water was deeper. Spatial connectivity had no detectable impact on the aquatic invertebrate or plant communities found in ditches. The number of families within the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT), which contain many pollution-sensitive species, declined with decreasing pH of ditch water. As time since dredging increased, the number of EPT families increased in permanent ditches but decreased in temporary ditches. Whether or not a ditch was in an agri-environment scheme had little impact on the reported management regime or biodiversity value of the ditch. Measures for increasing the amount of water in ditches, by increasing the water depth or promoting retention of water in ditches, could increase the biodiversity value of ditches in agricultural land. Some temporary ditches for specialised species should be retained. Reducing the amount of shade over narrow ditches by managing adjacent hedgerows is also likely to increase the species diversity of plant and invertebrate communities within the ditch. We recommend that to preserve or enhance the biodiversity value of ditches, and improve their ecosystem service delivery, management prescriptions for hedgerows adjacent to ditches should differ from those aimed at hedgerows only.","2015","2020-10-29 20:15:11","2021-10-19 13:13:54","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research has shown that VBS can be effective at trapping phosphorus (P) and other farm-sourced environmental contaminants. This project measured the effectiveness of established vegetated strips at decreasing P in runoff from agricultural fields in Manitoba. Paired samples of runoff, taken at the field edge and in the vegetated strip, indicated that in I I of the 22 cases sampled (50%), P concentrations in the runoff decreased (on average 30%) as the flow passed through the vegetated strip. In 7 of the 22 case (32%) there was no difference; however, in four of the 22 cases (18%), runoff P concentrations increased, indicating the vegetated strip had become a source of runoff P. Soil samples from the VBS showed high available P concentrations at positions within the vegetated strip along the runoff flow path, and in 7 of 10 cases these concentrations were higher (33% on average) than in the field soil. Although the observations and numerical results suggest that VBS can be effective at removing P in runoff, perhaps the major limitation in this flat-land region is that runoff tends to flow through rather small portions of the VBS, and these may not have sufficient capacity to retain the runoff P in the longer term.","2006","2020-10-29 20:15:12","2021-10-19 13:14:42","","871-884","","","86","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its most common parasitoid is Copidosoma aretas (Walker) (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea: Encyrtidae). To identify selective flowering plants that could be used to increase functional biodiversity, the longevity of C. aretas and its host A. comariana was assessed on 5 flowering species: buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum Moench (Caryophyllales: Polygonaceae); borage, Borago officinalis L. (Boraginaceae); strawberry, Fragaria x ananassa Duchesne (Rosales: Rosaceae); phacelia, Phacelia tanacetifolia Bentham (Boraginaceae); and dill, Anethum graveolens L. (Apiales: Apiaceae). Dill was only tested with C. aretas. Sucrose and pollen served as positive controls, and pure water as a negative control. In a subsequent field experiment, A. comariana larval density was assessed at 1, 6, and 11 m distances from buckwheat flower strips in 3 fields. The proportion of field- collected larvae that were parasitized by C. aretas or fungi was assessed. Among the tested floral diets, buckwheat was superior for C. aretas, increasing its longevity by 1.4 times compared to water. Although buckwheat also increased longevity of A. comariana, its longevity and survival on buckwheat, borage, and strawberry was not significantly different, so buckwheat was chosen for field experiments. A. comariana densities in the 3 fields with sown buckwheat flower strips were 0.5, 4.0, and 8.3 larvae per m per row of strawberry respectively. Of the collected larvae, a total of 1%, 39%, and 65% were parasitized by C. aretas, respectively. The density of A. comariana and the proportion parasitized by C. aretas were highly significantly correlated. Distance from floral strips had no significant effect on either A. comariana larval density or on the proportion of individuals parasitized by C. aretas. Few other parasitoids emerged from collected larvae, and no larvae were infected by entomopathogenic fungi. Still, total A. comariana mortality was significantly affected by distance to flower strips, with the highest mortality near the flower strips. As no effect of buckwheat flower strips on C. aretas parasitism was found, the positive effect they had on A. comariana control stems from unknown mortality factors. As literature indicates that buckwheat for flower strips can augment a more complex suite of natural enemies, one such mortality factor could be a non-consumptive predator and/or parasitoid effect, but this requires further study. If confirmed, buckwheat may be utilized together with a selective food plant, once identified.","2013","2020-10-29 20:15:13","2020-10-29 20:15:13","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Island has one of the highest percentages of land (about 48%) devoted to crop production and pasture in all of Canada. Therefore, identifying the landscape elements that can mitigate the effects of habitat fragmentation resulting from agricultural practices is essential to preserve the biodiversity of Prince Edward Island. We quantified species richness, abundance and diversity of small mammals in 13 hedgerows and 13 attached forest patches. Although all the species detected in forest patches were also found in hedgerows, significant differences in species diversity and abundance suggest that not all species benefit equally from hedgerows. The abundance of small mammals other than the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) increased in hedgerows longer than about 225-250 m, but was independent of hedgerow's length in hedgerows smaller than 225-250 m. Predators (Mustela erminea) were captured in hedgerows, but not in forest patches. Relationships between small mammal variables and hedgerow features (microhabitat, macrohabitat and landscape) suggested that most small mammal species would benefit from hedgerows having high shrub diversity, ground cover with vines and leaf litter, and few non-vegetated gaps. Removal of hedgerows, especially large ones, may affect long-term survival of some small mammal species inhabiting agricultural landscapes of Prince Edward Island.","2008","2020-10-29 20:15:14","2020-10-29 20:15:14","","110-124","","","159","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such predictions require an understanding of the habitat factors that determine species abundances. We relate British farmland bird abundance at the 1 km square scale to three variable sets: landscape composition (for example, areas of woodland, urban and arable), field boundary characteristics and cropping. We then use multi-model inference to summarize model fits for each variable set and compare their explanatory power to identify the relative importance of the three forms of description of the farm landscape. The important variables across species within each set show the habitat features that are most significant for the farmland bird community. Models comprising landscape variables provided the best fits for 21 of 31 bird species, while field boundary variables were most important for seven species and cropping variables for one. After controlling for landscape influences, we then found that field boundary variation was slightly more influential than cropping. These patterns remained when farmland-specialist species were considered alone. This shows that landscapes are the most important determinant of bird abundance and that cropping patterns and field boundary characteristics are influential only within the constraints of landscape structure. However, boundaries and, especially, crops remain important from a management perspective because they are more volatile, and can still drive population change. Important single variables that affected multiple species included woodland (predominantly negative even within farmland-dominated landscapes), hedges with trees (providing nesting habitat and song-posts) and heterogeneity both of landscapes and of cropping (predominantly positive effects). The results indicate which habitat features off er the most scope for induced population changes via management action and potentially provide relationships for input into predictive models with respect to land-use change.","2012","2020-10-29 20:15:15","2021-10-19 13:14:20","","162-173","","","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given these premises, a study was done on the eastern Po Plain, in a transition area between the Temperate (Eurosiberian) and Mediterranean climatic zones, adopting the same sample shape and dimensions as a North-American study [Corbit et al. (1999) J Ecol 87:220-232]. The following research questions were posed: (1) how common are forest species in hedgerows? (2) do origin, isolation, distance from source, width and adjacent land-use factors correlate with the frequency of forest species? (3) are hedgerows corridors for forest species? To address these, three functional types of hedgerows, identified by comparing old aerial-photos, were sampled: remnant attached (n = 12) and remnant isolated (n = 6) with respect to the nearest woodland and regenerated attached (n = 4). If wooded patches were a source for hedgerows, then regenerated hedgerows should be more similar to an adjacent woodland than an isolated remnant. A 900 m 2 circular plot in woodlands and an adjacent 90-m transect along hedgerows were sampled for the presence and cover of all plant species, then 39 woodland taxa were selected. Significant differences between the three hedgerow types emerged in forest species richness, but not in cover. The forest species composition in both remnant and regenerated attached hedgerows showed a strong affinity with the adjacent stand, implying a dispersal process from woodland (source) to regenerated hedgerows (sink). A distance effect on forest species distribution clearly linked to a corridor function was found only in regenerated hedgerows, while in the remnant attached ones, even with a composition similar to that of the nearest woodland source, other additional factors cannot be ignored to explain the fine scale distribution of forest species. The cover of the most common ant-dispersed species showed a similar distance effect while vertebrate-dispersed ones did not show any significant trend with distance from woodlands. Habitat suitability for forest species was affected by width, especially in hedges wider than 12 m, but not by adjacent land use. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","2007","2020-10-29 20:15:15","2021-10-19 13:14:12","","235-252","","","188","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fine—(at <250 m) and broad—(>550 m) spatial patterns of the key environmental predictors and the pure spatial effects on species richness were measured using a computation of the principal coordinates of a matrix of geographical neighbours integrated into a variation partitioning. The total explained variation of species richness among hedgerows was highest for wetland herbs (62 %), with increasing rates for rare plants (33 %), forest herbs (43 %) and arable weeds (47 %). 43–11 % of that variation was spatially structured and mostly explained by some of the key environmental predictors, such as proportion of a given landuse, presence of woody species and dead trees. This indicates that complex relationships between herbaceous species distribution and spatial processes exist in woody field margins and much of that is related to key factors which are spatially structured, both at fine or broad-scales, with implications for management and landuse planning. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","2014","2020-10-29 20:15:16","2021-10-19 13:13:53","","1323-1335","","","215","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ecological impacts of herbaceous riparian buffers on the channelized agricultural headwater streams that are common throughout the midwestern United States have not been evaluated. We sampled riparian habitat, geomorphology, instream habitat, water chemistry, fishes, and amphibians for 4 years from three channelized agricultural headwater streams without herbaceous riparian buffers and three channelized streams with herbaceous riparian buffers in central Ohio. Only seven of 55 response variables exhibited differences between buffer types. Riparian widths were greater in channelized headwater streams with herbaceous riparian buffers than streams without herbaceous riparian buffers. Percent insectivores and minnows were greater in channelized streams without herbaceous riparian buffers than streams with herbaceous riparian buffers. Percent clay, turbidity, specific conductance, and pH differed between buffer types only during one sampling period. No differences in geomorphology and amphibian communities occurred between buffer types. Our results suggest channelized agricultural headwater streams with and without herbaceous riparian buffers are similar physically, chemically, and biologically. Installation of herbaceous riparian buffers alone adjacent to channelized agricultural headwater streams in central Ohio and other parts of the midwestern United States may only provide limited environmental benefits for these stream ecosystems in the first 4-6 years after establishment.

Impact assessments documenting how habitat and aquatic biota within streams respond to these practices are needed for evaluating the effects of conservation practices. Numerous sampling protocols have been developed for monitoring streams. However, protocols designed for monitoring studies are not appropriate for impact assessments. We developed guiding principles for designing impact assessments of ecological responses to conservation practices. The guiding principles are as follows: (1) develop the hypothesis first, (2) use replicated experimental designs having controls and treatments, (3) assess the habitat and biological characteristics with quantitative and repeatable sampling methods, (4) use multiple sampling techniques for collecting aquatic organisms, and (5) standardize sampling efforts for aquatic organisms. The guiding principles were applied in designing a study intended to evaluate the influence of herbaceous riparian buffers on channelized headwater streams in central Ohio. Our example highlights that the application of our recommendations will result in impact assessments that are hypothesis-driven and incorporate quantitative methods for the measurement of abiotic and biotic attributes.

Currently, installation of erosion control structures (drop pipes) at the riparian zone—agricultural field interface halts gully erosion and simultaneously establishes one of four riparian habitat types. Avian communities were compared among four types of restored habitats and among four seasonal periods in northwestern Mississippi from June 1994 to May 1996. Fifty-seven species were observed among riparian habitats, of which 49% were neotropical migrants. Habitat type and season significantly affected species richness, abundance, and diversity. Species richness, abundance, and diversity increased as habitat area, pool volume, and vertical structure of woody vegetation increased among riparian habitat types. Additionally, species richness, abundance, and diversity increased during spring and fall. The influence of habitat type on avian species richness, abundance, and diversity did not differ among seasons. Present drop pipe installation practices focus on erosion control without consideration of habitat creation. Installation practices can be altered to more effectively incorporate habitat creation to provide the greatest ecological benefits for avian communities within impacted riparian zones.

However, information on the long-term development of field margin plant communities remains limited. We describe a long-term experiment on the effects of field margin management on biodiversity and weed species. Swards were established by natural regeneration or sowing a grass and wildflower seed mixture, and treatments manipulated the frequency and timing of mowing, application of herbicide and leaving of hay. Vegetation was monitored to evaluate the extent to which early conclusions remained valid after 13 years. Although early successional trends suggested that naturally regenerated swards would rapidly become dominated by pernicious perennial weeds, and that sown swards would exclude such species, neither was true in the longer term. Sown swards were eventually invaded by unsown perennials, but they remained distinct from naturally regenerated swards. Plant species richness declined throughout the experiment. Annuals were lost most rapidly from sown swards but, under natural regeneration, loss could be modified by mowing. Perennial species initially increased during natural regeneration before stabilising. In sown swards they declined under all treatments. Species richness in naturally regenerating swards was promoted initially by mowing twice annually. After 13 years, timing and frequency of mowing had no significant effect on species richness although it still influenced sward composition. Leaving cut hay lying produced species-poor swards. We conclude that the choice of establishment and management methods for arable field margins significantly affects the long-term conservation value of the swards. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Sixty sites were sampled five times at monthly intervals using yellow sticky traps. The abundance of coccinellids in shelterbelts was influenced to a greater extent by adjacent crop type and aphid abundance rather than vegetation characteristics like canopy flowers. Abundance of some species was 2–5 times higher in riparian shelterbelts while increased litter depth decreased abundance. When the leaf litter depth of shelterbelts was experimentally increased, the abundance of coccinellids decreased, whereas an experimental decrease in porosity tended to have the opposite effect. These findings suggest that coccinellid abundance can be influenced to some extent by characteristics of shelterbelts, but crop type and prey availability is likely to have a relatively larger impact, perhaps reflecting the high movement rates of this group of natural enemies.

The availability of floral resources influenced a single family; the abundance of the Trichogrammatidae was doubled by the presence of canopy floral resources. By contrast, an increased abundance of some large Hymenoptera families was associated with a decreasing leaf litter depth and the proportion of introduced ground cover, an increased grass height and the amount of ground with vegetated cover., These findings suggest that specific manipulations of shelterbelts could increase populations of beneficials to some degree, with potential effects on pests.

The establishment of grassy strips at the margins of arable fields is an agri-environment scheme that aims to provide resources for native flora and fauna and thus increase farmland biodiversity. These margins can be managed to target certain groups, such as farmland birds and pollinators, but the impact of such management on the soil fauna has been poorly studied. This study assessed the effect of seed mix and management on the biodiversity, conservation and functional value of field margins for soil macrofauna. 2. Experimental margin plots were established in 2001 in a winter wheat field in Cambridgeshire, UK, using a factorial design of three seed mixes and three management practices [spring cut, herbicide application and soil disturbance (scarification)]. In spring and autumn 2005, soil cores taken from the margin plots and the crop were hand-sorted for soil macrofauna. The Lumbricidae, Isopoda, Chilopoda, Diplopoda, Carabidae and Staphylinidae were identified to species and classified according to feeding type. 3. Diversity in the field margins was generally higher than in the crop, with the Lumbricidae, Isopoda and Coleoptera having significantly more species and/or higher abundances in the margins. Within the margins, management had a significant effect on the soil macrofauna, with scarified plots containing lower abundances and fewer species of Isopods. The species composition of the scarified plots was similar to that of the crop. 4. Scarification also reduced soil- and litter-feeder abundances and predator species densities, although populations appeared to recover by the autumn, probably as a result of dispersal from neighbouring plots and boundary features. The implications of the responses of these feeding groups for ecosystem services are discussed. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that the management of agri-environment schemes can significantly influence their value for soil macrofauna. In order to encourage the litter-dwelling invertebrates that tend to be missing from arable systems, agri-environment schemes should aim to minimize soil cultivation and develop a substantial surface litter layer. However, this may conflict with other aims of these schemes, such as enhancing floristic and pollinator diversity.

The management of scheme options can influence their value for delivering ecosystem services by modifying the composition of floral and faunal communities. This study examines the impact of an agri-environment scheme prescription on ecosystem functioning by testing the hypothesis that vegetation management influences decomposition rates in grassy arable field margins. The effects of two vegetation management practices in arable field margins - cutting and soil disturbance (scarification) - on litter decomposition were compared using a litterbag experimental approach in early April 2006. Bags had either small mesh designed to restrict access to soil macrofauna, or large mesh that would allow macrofauna to enter. Bags were positioned on the soil surface or inserted into the soil in cut and scarified margins, retrieved after 44, 103 and 250 days and the amount of litter mass remaining was calculated. Litter loss from the litterbags with large mesh was greater than from the small mesh bags, providing evidence that soil macrofauna accelerate rates of litter decomposition. In the large mesh bags, the proportion of litter remaining in bags above and belowground in the cut plots was similar, while in the scarified plots, there was significantly more litter left in the aboveground bags than in the belowground bags. This loss of balance between decomposition rates above and belowground in scarified margins may have implications for the development and maintenance of grassy arable field margins by influencing nutrient availability for plant communities.

We investigated the soil properties, nutrient dynamics and vegetation composition at the riparian agriculture interface. Soil physicochemical and vegetation properties were spatially heterogeneous along the transition from the grazed paddock into the un-grazed and revegetated riparian zone. Soil C stocks varied considerably across the site, with values ranging from 2% in the paddock to 5% in the riparian zone. Using Bayesian model selection, a predictive model for total soil carbon was developed. By including soil moisture content and canopy cover in the model, it was possible to predict total soil carbon with 80% accuracy at the site level and 87% at the transect level. This opens up the potential for total soil carbon levels to be estimated by the quantification of easily measured ecosystem properties. Analysis of the chemical nature of the carbon in theses soils by solid state C-13 NMR spectroscopy, showed the presence of more recalcitrant forms of carbon in the revegetated riparian zone compared to the grazed paddock. Spatial patterns of soil mineral N pools were highly variable (NO4+ - N ranged from 1 to 5 mu g/g dry soil; NO3- - N ranged from 0.4 to 2.2 mu g/g dry soil); however, clear patterns in potentially mineralizable N (PMN) were observed, with rates of PMN in the paddock being less than half of those adjacent to the stream in the riparian zone. Results are discussed in the context of the dynamic nature of soil processes at the agriculture - riparian interface, and the potential to develop models to predict soil carbon using easily measurable vegetation and soil properties.

Changes in agricultural practices during the past 50 years have been suggested as one of the major causes of this decline. Field-border conservation practices encouraged by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Conservation Buffer Initiative meet many of the needs of sustainable agriculture and offer excellent opportunities to enhance local grassland bird populations within intensive agricultural production systems. Despite the abundant information on avian use of, and reproductive success in, strip habitats during the breeding season, few studies have examined the potential value of field borders for wintering birds. We planted 89.0 km of field borders (6.1 m wide) along agricultural field edges on one-half of each of three row crop and forage production farms in northeastern Mississippi. We sampled bird communities along these field edges during February-March 2002 and 2003 using line-transect distance sampling and strip transects to estimate density and community structure, respectively. We used Program DISTANCE to estimate densities of Song (Melospiza melodia), Savannah (Passerculus sandwichensis), and other sparrows along bordered and non-bordered transects while controlling for adjacent plant community. Greater densities of several sparrow species were observed along most bordered transects. However, effects of field borders differed by species and adjacent plant community types. Diversity, species richness, and relative conservation value (a weighted index derived by multiplying species-specific abundances by their respective Partners in Flight conservation priority scores) were similar between bordered and non-bordered edges. Field borders are practical conservation tools that can be used to accrue multiple environmental benefits and enhance wintering farmland bird populations. Provision of wintering habitat at southern latitudes may influence population trajectories of short-distance migrants of regional conservation concern.

Recently, CP33 (Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds) was added as a new continuous Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) practice designed to address habitat goals for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) under the Northern Bobwhite Conservation Initiative. However, it is presumed that this practice will also benefit other birds. To evaluate potential benefits of CP33 field borders for farmland birds, we established a total of 89.0 km of experimental field borders (6.1-m wide) along agriculture field edges on three 405-ha farms in Clay and Lowndes counties, Mississippi. We used 200-m x 20-m strip transects to measure abundance and diversity of birds inhabiting bordered and non-bordered field edges. Indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea) and dickcissel (Spiza americana) abundances were nearly twofold greater along bordered field edges. However, mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), and common grackle (Quiscalus quiscula) abundances did not differ between bordered and non-bordered field edges. Field borders adjacent to strip habitats (i.e., fencerows, drainage ditches) had greater total bird and red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) abundance than non-bordered edges adjacent to strip habitats. Species richness was greater along bordered than non-bordered edges. Within intensive agricultural landscapes where large-scale grassland restoration is impractical, USDA conservation buffer practices such as field borders (CP33) may be useful for enhancing local breeding bird richness and abundance.","2005","2020-10-29 20:15:24","2021-10-19 13:13:38","","43-56","","","59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Government sponsored programs like the Cropland Reserve Program generally require the planting of specific vegetative species during buffer restoration, although the effectiveness of such an approach when compared to restoration by volunteer species is unknown. We studied the effect of differences in vegetation structure on avian habitat in riparian buffer zones. A 25 m (82 ft) wide planted woodland buffer, 30 m (98 ft) wide grass, shrub, and woodland three-zone buffer, and a 9 m (30 ft) wide shrub buffer were evaluated for habitat potential using breeding-bird counts and vegetation surveys. Bird density and species richness varied with the structure of the vegetative communities present at the three sites. Avian species richness and total detections were higher in the three-zone buffer than in both the shrub and planted buffer, likely a result of the diversity of vegetation at the site. These data suggest that restoration of riparian areas by allowing fallow vegetation to recolonize is at the very least equally beneficial to avian wildlife as is restoration by planting specific grass, shrub, and tree species. Buffer restoration by natural revegetation using this method could be recommended as an alternative to implementation by planting riparian species due to its simplicity and cost effectiveness.","2008","2020-10-29 20:15:25","2021-10-19 13:13:46","","277-288","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Agricultural conservation practices such as native perennial vegetation (NPV) strips will influence carbon cycling of an upland agroecosystem, and could affect how much DOC enters streams in runoff, potentially affecting aquatic ecosystems. In a study conducted in Iowa (USA), four treatments with strips of NPV varying in slope position and proportion of area were randomly assigned among 12 small agricultural watersheds in a balanced incomplete block design. Runoff samples from 2008 to 2010 were analyzed for DOC and correlated with flow data to determine flow weighted DOC concentrations and loads. Data were analyzed for the entire 3 years, annually, seasonally, monthly, by flow event size and for one extreme storm event. Overall we found few differences in DOC concentration with the exception that concentrations were greater in the 10 % NPV at the footslope watersheds than the 20 % NPV in contours watersheds over the 3 years, and the 100 % agricultural treatment had higher DOC concentrations than all NPV treatments during the one extreme event. Because the NPV treatments reduced runoff, DOC export tended to be highest in the 100 % agricultural watersheds over the 3 years and during high flows. We also compared two watersheds that were restored to 100 % NPV and found decreases in DOC concentrations and loads indicating that complete conversion to prairie leads to less watershed DOC export. Regression results also support the contention that increases in the percentage of NPV in the watershed decreases watershed export of DOC. Further analysis indicated that DOC concentrations were diluted as flow event size increased, independent of any treatment effects. It appears groundwater sources become an important component to flow as flow event size increases in these watersheds.","2014","2020-10-29 20:15:26","2021-10-19 13:13:51","","121-132","","","120","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty seven species of butterflies (imagines) were recorded during the study period. Pieris napi and P.rapae dominated in all shelterbelts. Their dominance in 6-7 years old shelterbelts amounted to 30 and 24%, respectively, while in younger one (1-2 years old) - 34 and 32%.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of narrow grass hedges (NGHs) on reducing the transport of antimicrobials and ARGs in runoff after land application of swine manure slurry. Plot-scale rainfall simulation tests were conducted on 0.75 m by 4.0 m plots designed to test three treatment factors: manure amendment (control plots receiving no manure vs. amended plots receiving manure based on 3 times N requirement), NGH (plots with a NGH vs. plots without a NGH), and rainfall events (days 1-3). Runoff generated during three 30-min simulated rainfall events was sampled and analyzed for antimicrobials and ARGs. Manure amendment was responsible for the presence of antimicrobial tylosin (p < 0.0001) and tylosin resistance gene erm(B) (p < 0.0001) in runoff. Narrow grass hedges proved to be effective in reducing tylosin (p < 0.0001) and erm(B) (p < 0.0347) in runoff. Manure amendment was responsible for the introduction of tylosin (p < 0.0482) and erm(B) (p = 0.0128) into the soil; however, it had no significant impact on the abundance of the 16S rRNA gene in soil.

Specifically, we examined the effect of rotationally and continuously grazed pastures and different types of riparian buffer strips on water chemistry, physical habitat, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish as indicators of stream quality. We collected data at 17 sites under different combinations of grazing and riparian management, using a longitudinal design on three streams and a paired watershed design on two others. Continuous and rotational grazing were compared along one longitudinal study stream and at the paired watershed. Riparian buffer management, fenced trees (wood buffer), fenced grass, and unfenced rotationally grazed areas were the focus along the two remaining longitudinal streams. Principal components analysis (PCA) of water chemistry, physical habitat, and biotic data indicated a local management effect. The ordinations separated continuous grazing from sites with rotational grazing and sites with wood buffers from those with grass buffers or rotationally grazed areas. Fecal coliform and turbidity were consistently higher at continuously grazed than rotationally grazed sites. Percent fines in the streambed were significantly higher at sites with wood buffers than grass and rotationally grazed areas, and canopy cover was similar at sites with wood and grass buffers. Benthic macroinvertebrate metrics were significant but were not consistent across grazing and riparian buffer management types. Fish density and abundance were related to riparian buffer type, rather than grazing practices. Our study has potentially important implications for stream restoration programs in the midwestern United Slates. Our comparisons suggest further consideration and study of a combination of grass and wood riparian buffer strips as midwestern stream management options, rather than universally installing wood buffers in every instance.","2000","2020-10-29 20:15:30","2021-10-19 13:14:07","","629-641","","","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There was always a trend of increasing yield from the edge of the field to the centre, with a marked reduction around the 'tramlines' and the area where machinery turns. In the studies on commercial farms, headland yield loss varied widely. In sugar beet the headlands yielded 19-41% less than the centre, with a mean reduction of 26%. In cereals the range was 3-19%, with a mean loss of 7%. Headland yield reductions were generally smaller in the field experiments than those found on commercial farms. These headland effects did not move towards the centre of the field when grass margins were planted at the edge of the field; there was no significant effect on the yield of the adjacent crop. The presence of boundary trees had the greatest effect on yield: in the outer 9 m of the field, the area shaded by trees produced 4.4 t ha(-1) of wheat, and the area that was not shaded 8.1 t ha(-1). Turning of machinery also significantly reduced yield, while grazing by rabbits and hares surprisingly had no effect. Following the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in 1992, the main effect of which was to change from a price support policy to direct payments to producers, farmers in the European Union who produce more than a specified tonnage of 'eligible crops' per year, are required to fallow a given percentage of their land (currently 5%), to qualify for Arable Area Payments. Growers can elect to fallow fields on a rotational basis, or permanently. Headland set-aside is a term used to describe strips of set-aside, a minimum of 20 m wide around the edges of fields. In these experiments, the headland effect did not extend beyond 20 m from the field edge. Therefore, particularly in fields with boundary hedges or trees, headland set-aside could effectively remove the poor-yielding area at the field margin.","1998","2020-10-29 20:15:31","2020-10-29 20:15:31","","129-142","","","132","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within this context, a study was conducted in Italy with the goals of: (a) designing three alternative chip harvesting methods for buffer strips, (b) field-testing the performance of each alternative, and (c) developing a model for estimating the cost of these methods under varying operational and economic conditions. The three harvesting methods reflected different mechanization levels, with escalating investment requirements. Overall, the study demonstrated that frequent maintenance of young, single row buffer strips generates profits only when thoroughly mechanized. Using a dedicated feller-buncher, a front-end loader for extraction and an industrial truck-mounted chipper brought the delivered cost below the 14 EURO/m(3) supercript stop loose chips (approximately 4 EURO/GJ) presently paid by the district heating stations.

Values for pH, specific conductance, alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), silica, ammonium, phosphorus, iron, and manganese at 28 sites in the Contentnea Creek Basin were significantly higher (p < 0.10) in old (>20 yr) discharging ground water draining areas with riparian buffers compared with areas without riparian buffers. No differences in chloride, nitrate nitrogen, calcium, sodium, and dissolved oxygen concentrations in old ground water between buffer and nonbuffer areas were detected. Comparison of samples of young (<20 yr) discharging ground water samples from buffer and nonbuffer areas indicated significantly higher specific conductance, calcium, chloride, and nitrate nitrogen in nonbuffer areas. Riparian buffers along streams can affect the composition of the hyporheic zone by providing a source of organic carbon to the streambed, which creates reducing geochemical conditions that consequently can affect the chemical quality of old ground water discharging through it. Buffer zones between agricultural fields and streams facilitate dilution of conservative chemical constituents in young ground water that originate from fertilizer applications and also allow denitrification in ground water by providing an adequate source of organic carbon generated by vegetation in the buffer zone. Based on the median chloride and nitrate values for young ground water in the Contentnea Creek Basin, nitrate was 95% lower in buffer areas compared with nonbuffer areas, with a 30 to 35% reduction estimated to be due to dilution and 65 to 70% due to reduction and/or denitrification.","2000","2020-10-29 20:15:33","2020-10-29 20:15:33","","1523-1538","","","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://www.crossref.org/openurl?pid=zoteroDOI@wiernik.org&url_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fzotero.org%3A2&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=Statistical%20evaluation%20of%20effects%20of%20riparian%20buffers%20on%20nitrate%20and%20ground%20water%20quality&rft.jtitle=Journal%20of%20Environmental%20Quality&rft.volume=29&rft.aufirst=T.%20B.&rft.aulast=Spruill&rft.au=T.%20B.%20Spruill&rft.date=2000&rft.pages=1523-1538&rft.spage=1523&rft.epage=1538&rft.issn=0047-2425","eppi-reviewer4","❓ Multiple DOI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the processes governing changes to the floral biodiversity of hedges are poorly understood. We analysed a unique, long-term data set of plant species richness over a 70. year period at 357 hedgerow sites in southern England to quantify changes in α, β and γ diversity, and identify the role of hedge management and other possible drivers of change. Alpha diversity increased in hedgerows, while a reduction in β diversity was indicated by taxonomic homogenisation, whereby previously distinct communities of species become more similar to one another over time. Changes in the regional species pool (. γ diversity) differed with plant life-history; it increased for woody species but decreased among herbaceous hedge species. Hedgerow communities shifted towards species associated with higher soil fertility, a more competitive ecological strategy and, in unmanaged hedgerows, greater shade tolerance. Probable drivers for these changes include the move from traditional forms of management such as coppicing and hedge-laying towards either no management or frequent cutting with a mechanical flail, and eutrophication. The extent of changes in plant diversity over time was determined by both historical and recent hedgerow management, but these management effects varied with plant life-history attributes. However, changes in hedge quality and floral diversity were not linked directly to a 60% increase in the proportion of land use categories classified as 'intensive' adjacent to the sites over the 70. years.

Currently, 41% of managed hedgerow length in England forms part of three Agri-Environment Scheme (AES) options, which specify a reduction in hedgerow cutting frequency from the most common practice of annual cutting. These AES options aim to increase the availability of flowers and berries for wildlife, but there has been little rigorous testing of their efficacy or estimates of the magnitude of their effects. We conducted a factorial experiment on hawthorn hedges to test the effects of (i) cutting frequency (every 1, 2 or 3. years) and (ii) timing of cutting (autumn vs. winter) on the abundance of flowers and berry resources. Results from 5. years show that hedgerow cutting reduced the number of flowers by up to 75% and the biomass of berries available over winter by up to 83% compared to monitored uncut hedges. Reducing cutting frequency from every year to every 3. years resulted in 2.1 times more flowers and a 3.4 times greater berry mass over 5. years. Cutting every 2. years had an intermediate effect on flower and berry abundance, but the increase in biomass of berries depended on cutting in winter rather than autumn. The most popular AES option is cutting every 2. years (32% of English managed hedgerow length). If these hedges were managed under a 3. year cutting regime instead, we estimate that biomass of berries would increase by about 40%, resulting in a substantial benefit for wildlife. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","2012","2020-10-29 20:15:35","2021-10-19 13:14:25","","24-29","","","145","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The USDA Continuous Conservation Reserve Program (CCRP) is one answer to this shift in philosophy. One program within CCRP, CP33, habitat buffers for upland birds, was designed to provide incentives for substituting herbaceous buffers for crop field margins to promote wildlife habitat. Farmers have been slow to sign up for CP33, possibly out of concern for the borders’ impact on insect pest abundance, crop yield and profitability. We examined the impact of three herbaceous border compositions on yield in soybean over 3 years. The border treatments were: (1) a cool-season grass/legume mixture, (2) a warm-season grass/legume mixture, and (3) tall fescue. In addition, the experimental control (soybean border) provided the opportunity to examine the effect of hedgerows on crop yield. We found only a few differences in soybean yield among border treatments and discerned no specific cause-and-effect relationship between buffers and soybean yield, or among distances into the soybean fields from the crop–border interface. We conclude that herbaceous conservation buffers would have little or no impact on soybean yield and should be promoted for their positive environmental benefits.

For field testing of transgenic constructs that have not been granted full environmental release, current Canadian Government regulations require either large isolation zones (200 m) or 10 m wide borders of synchronously flowering, non-transgenic B. Napus to contain transgenic pollen. To investigate the effectiveness of border areas in containing transgenic B. napus pollen, border areas 15 to 30 m wide were planted around 30 m x 60 m central plots of bromoxynil-herbicide-resistant transgenic B. napus strains. Four field trials were conducted at Carman and Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada in 1994 and 1995. Seed samples were harvested from the border area at 0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 m for the four cardinal directions and additionally at 20, 25, and 30 m for two cardinal directions. These seed samples were planted in the field in 1995 and 1996 and the seedlings screened for the presence of bromoxynil-resistant plants (i.e., from outcrossed seeds). Distance from the central plot significantly affected outcrossing rates while environment (site-year) and direction effects were non-significant. Outcrossing rates averaged 0.70% at 0 m and declined exponentially to 0.02% at 30 m. More than four-fifths of the total outcross events detected occurred in the first 10 m of border area indicating that border areas effectively reduce pollen-mediated gene flow in B. napus but cannot completely eliminate it.","2000","2020-10-29 20:15:36","2021-10-19 13:13:46","","","","","- 80","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4; - 57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To evaluate the spatial extent of the effects of forest cover on stream ecosystems, we measured algae, invertebrate, and fish biomass and invertebrate and fish community structure in 38 small first- to third-order streams in the National Capital Region of Canada along with forest cover at different spatial scales. 2. We considered 55 spatial scales of forest cover including several buffer widths (doubling 10–320 m) and lengths (doubling 10–1280 m, entire riparian distance upstream from sampling area) and entire catchments to determine which spatial scale maximized the correlation with biomass and metrics of community structure. 3. The proportion of variability in biomass and structural metrics explained by forest cover generally increased with increasing scale, suggesting that catchment-wide disturbances are the most influential determinants of benthic and fish communities. 4. Catchment forest cover explained more variation in algal (adjusted r 2 = 0.54), invertebrate (adjusted r 2 = 0.51) and fish (adjusted r 2 = 0.33) biomass than structural metrics of invertebrates and fish (adjusted r 2 = 0.08–0.27). 5. Analyses of the partial effects of forest cover at three scales (reach, riparian and the entire catchment) on biomass and community structure metrics identified catchment and reach scales as being most influential and never detected a significant partial effect of forest cover at the riparian scale. 6. These results suggest that maintenance or protection of reach and riparian buffers alone will not sufficiently protect stream function and structure from catchment-wide impacts.

Half of the field was cultivated with minimum tillage (shallow tillage with a tine cultivator) and half was conventionally ploughed. Within each cultivation treatment there were different treatment areas (TAs). In the first year of the experiment, one TA was cultivated up and down the slope, one TA was cultivated on the contour, with a beetle bank acting as a vegetative barrier partway up the slope, and one had a mixed direction cultivation treatment, with cultivation and drilling conducted up and down the slope and all subsequent operations conducted on the contour. In the second year, this mixed treatment was replaced with contour cultivation. Results showed no significant reduction in runoff, sediment losses or total phosphorus losses from minimum tillage when compared to the conventional plough treatment, but there were increased losses of total dissolved phosphorus with minimum tillage. The mixed direction cultivation treatment increased surface runoff and losses of sediment and phosphorus. Increasing surface roughness with contour cultivation reduced surface runoff compared to up and down slope cultivation in both the plough and minimum tillage treatment areas, but this trend was not significant. Sediment and phosphorus losses in the contour cultivation treatment followed a very similar pattern to runoff. Combining contour cultivation with a vegetative barrier in the form of a beetle bank to reduce slope length resulted in a non-significant reduction in surface runoff, sediment and total phosphorus when compared to up and down slope cultivation, but there was a clear trend towards reduced losses. However, the addition of a beetle bank did not provide a significant reduction in runoff, sediment losses or total phosphorus losses when compared to contour cultivation, suggesting only a marginal additional benefit. The economic implications for farmers of the different treatment options are investigated in order to assess their suitability for implementation at a field scale. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, despite this constituting a major land-use change, surprisingly little is known about the effects of these strips on riparian organisms. We investigated the effect that widespread adoption of buffer strips may have on activity density, species diversity, and assemblage composition of ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae). Over 2years, we sampled carabids from 41 riparian margins within two river catchments in north-east Scotland. We compared three types of riparian margin: unbuffered (i.e. unimproved'), vegetated buffer strips, and wooded, the latter acting as reference sites. A range of site parameters including characteristics of soil, water, and vegetation were recorded and the extent to which they correlated with ground beetle assemblages was explored. Catchment and treatment effects were detected on ground beetle activity density and species diversity with unbuffered sites showing higher activity density and species richness. The assemblage structure differed according to catchment, treatment, and local characteristics. Multivariate analysis suggested that soil and vegetation parameters and stream width, together with buffer strip age and length were determinants of assemblage structure. Few riparian species were found in large numbers. This study shows that in intensively managed agricultural landscapes riparian buffer strips do not create the quality of habitat required by truly riparian species. They do, however, provide habitat for woodland and stenotopic species and with more careful planning could play a role in increasing habitat heterogeneity at a landscape scale.","2014","2020-10-29 20:15:41","2021-10-19 13:13:53","","172-184","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It would be possible to largely eliminate natural resource degeneration through judicious application of on-farm conservation practices. Farmers have little economic incentive to conserve because, according to previous research, most conservation techniques have been demonstrated to be unprofitable. The empirical research into three alternative types of conservation practices for this study confirms that two (conservation crops and riparian buffer strips) provide for net costs to farmers, and that the third (conservation soil tillage) is not profitable under all circumstances. At the same time, the research shows that two out of the three sets of practices, namely riparian buffer strips and conservation tillage, can be economically beneficial to society as a whole, This raises the question of whether and to what extent society, as economic gainers, should offer compensation to farmers as economic losers. This study furthermore establishes that not all conservation practices that result in reduced soil erosion will lead to decreased sediment and phosphorus loadings into watercourses; that not all reduced sediment and phosphorus loadings lead to improved water quality; and that, even where an improvement to water quality in chemical, physical, biological and aesthetic terms can be obtained, the costs to society of achieving improvement may exceed the economic benefits. Such outcomes can readily promote disagreements between environmentalists and ecologists on the one hand and socio-economists on the other.

The density of field boundaries on the farms studied was high and could have positive implications for delivery of environmental public goods and sustainable farming metrics. In more intensively farmed areas, field boundaries were the only remaining semi-natural habitat on some farms highlighting the need to retain, and improve the ecological quality, of these features. The condition of one field boundary type (hedgerows) was also investigated in further detail.

To date, variable responses of abundance, species richness, and species diversity of small mammals have been recorded in riparian and upland habitats. To address this variability, we provide a detailed analysis of seasonal changes in abundance and diversity of terrestrial small-mammal communities over a 7-year period within an agricultural landscape in south-central British Columbia, Canada. We tested the hypotheses (H) that abundance, species richness, and species diversity of communities of small mammals (H-1), and demographic parameters of reproduction, recruitment, and survival of the major species: deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and montane vole (Microtus montanus) (H-2), would be higher in riparian than upland habitats. Mean total abundance of small mammals was higher in summer and winter, and species richness higher in summer, in riparian than hedgerow habitats. Winter population data supported the total and species abundance patterns for small mammals, but species richness was similar, and diversity lower, in riparian than hedgerow sites during winter periods. Deer mice were the dominant species in terms of abundance and reproductive output for pregnancies and recruitment, but not survival, in riparian sites. Montane voles were similar in abundance and demographic parameters in the two habitats. House mice (Mus musculus) preferred hedgerows and wandering shrews (Sorex vagrans) riparian sites. Demographic parameters for deer mice and montane voles indicated that both riparian and hedgerow sites were ""source"" rather than ""sink"" habitats, and likely contribute to maintenance of mammal diversity in agricultural landscapes.","2014","2020-10-29 20:15:46","2021-10-19 13:14:25","","325-336","","","59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Installation of vegetated buffers on loamy soils dramatically reduced the bacterial contamination of runoff water from manure-treated pasturelands, but the size of the vegetated buffer was not an important determinant of bacterial removal efficiency. Only 10% of the runoff samples collected from treatment cells having vegetated buffers exhibited FCB concentrations > 200 colony forming units (cfu)/100 mL (a common water quality standard value), and the median concentration for all cells containing vegetated buffers was only 6 cfu/100 mL. The presence of a vegetated buffer of any size, from 1 to 25 m, generally reduced the median FCB concentration in runoff by more than 99%. Results for FCB load calculations were similar. Our results suggest that where substantial FCB contamination of runoff occurs from manure-treated pasturelands, it might be disproportionately associated with specific field or management conditions, such as the presence of soils that exhibit low water infiltration and generate larger volumes of runoff or the absence of a vegetated buffer. Buffer size regulations that do not consider such differences might not be efficient or effective in reducing bacterial contamination of runoff.","2007","2020-10-29 20:15:46","2021-10-19 13:13:50","","958-965","","","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined whether abundance, species richness, and species diversity of small mammals in tree fruit orchards differed from linear, edge habitats along orchard margins. Our five edges spanned grassy to wooded habitats. Linear habitats were intensively sampled for vascular plants in 2003 and small mammal communities from 2003 to 2007. Vegetation and total abundance of small mammal species among three types of hedgerows were similar and population changes followed those within nearby apple orchards. Species richness and diversity of small mammals, however, were significantly higher in hedgerows than orchards. Fewer mammals occupied hedgerows with high volumes of herb and shrub biomass, but richness and diversity of mammals did increase with shrub volume. All seven species of small mammals were represented in the hedgerow communities, including two species at risk: the Great Basin pocket mouse Perognathus parvus and the western harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys megalotis). Two types of field margins (orchard-sagebrush and orchard-old field) along fencerows provided habitat for P. parvus. Field margins managed for herbaceous plant species along fencerows and other such linear configurations provided habitat for R. megalotis. Linear non-crop habitats should maintain the overall small mammal community, as well as the two species at risk, within this semi-arid agricultural landscape.

Standard census techniques and sticky board trapping were used to assess numbers of syrphids, whilst weekly flower head counts were used to quantify the flora resources available in each of the patches. 2 The field margin supported a greater diversity and density of syrphids than the within-crop wildflower patches, despite having a relatively lower flower head density. Presumably this was in response to other resources that field margins offer, namely additional aphid resources, shelter from predation, lekking sites and suitable flight-paths. 3 The commonest species of syrphid, Episyrphus balteatus, demonstrated a very positive habitat association with the field margin and was rarely reported in the field patches. Therefore, it may be an unsuitable candidate for the biological control of aphids via augmentation of numbers using non-host resources. 4 Patch size and shape had little effect on the spatial distributions of syrphids, probably because of the adult syrphids' high mobility. 5 Of greater influence was the number of flowers contained in each habitat patch. Typically, patches with higher numbers of flowers had significantly greater aggregations of hoverflies. Habitat manipulation by the provision of flowers in patches seems to increase the local density of hoverflies. Further work is necessary to establish the importance of flower density in enhancing the control of pest populations.","2001","2020-10-29 20:15:48","2020-10-29 20:15:48","","57-64","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vegetated buffer zones adjacent to a stream can effectively remove and retain nutrients and sediments. It is, therefore, important to study design criteria which optimise the effect of buffer zones (BZ). This paper describes the influence of four criteria: (i) buffer zone width, (ii) amount of surface runoff water entering the BZ, (iii) seasonal variation and (iv) vegetation type. These parameters were studied after simulated and natural runoff at four different sites in Southern Norway with cold temperate climate. Surface runoff was collected before entering and after passing the BZs. The simulation experiments were short-term experiments carried out over a few days in 1992 and 1993. In the natural runoff experiments, volume proportional mixed samples were collected after each runoff period during 1992-1999. The results show significantly higher removal efficiency (in %) from 10 m wide BZs compared to 5 m widths, however, the specific retention (per m(2)) is higher in 5 m BZ. Buffer zones can receive particle runoff over several days without a significant decrease in their removal level. Retention efficiency between summer and autumn varied depending on the measured parameter (phosphorus, particles and nitrogen), and there were no significant differences in removal efficiency between summer and winter.-The results show no significant differences between forest buffer zones (FBZ) and grass buffer zones (GBZ) regarding their retention efficiency for nitrogen and phosphorus. There was significantly higher retention efficiency in FBZ for particles.

Several investigations, even during snowmelt season, have shown that retention of sediments and sediment-bound nutrients in runoff water has been high through buffer zones (BZ). It is likely that BZ also can be effective filters for sediment-bound pesticides. The retention of glyphosate, propiconazole, fenpropimorph and soil particles was studied in surface runoff experiments with 5 m wide buffer zones. Volume proportional samples were collected after each runoff episode (1999-2002). The distribution W coefficient (K(d)) shows moderate to high adsorption of the pesticides to the experimental soil. Results show average retention efficiency of about 51%, 48%, 85% and 34% for particles, glyphosate, propiconazole and a, fenpropimorph, respectively. The amount of AMPA (which is a degradation product of glyphosate), entering the BZ was high; approximately the same amount as for glyphosate. The retention efficiency through the BZ for AMPA was about 67%. There were no significant differences in removal efficiency (in %) between winter with snowmelt and summer. This is possibly due to detachment of coarser aggregates during winter, which trap more easily in the BZ. The conclusion based on this study suggests BZ to be contributors to reduced pesticide input to surface waters.","2005","2020-10-29 20:15:54","2021-10-19 13:13:43","","63-71","","","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A 2-year field study was conducted that combined PAM with (1) check dams, (2) surge irrigation, (3) surface drains, and (4) grass filter strips. The study was conducted at three sites: two vineyards (A and B) with silt loam soils at 1.2% slope and a cornfield with sandy loam soils at 0.2% slope. During irrigation events, water samples and flow records were taken at periodic intervals from each treatment to determine nutrient concentrations and loads (total nitrogen (TN), total Kjeldahl N (TKN), nitrate-N (NO3-N), total phosphorus (TP), particulate P (PP), soluble phosphorus (SP), and sediment load (SL)). For all treatments and sites, TN and TP concentrations were compared to USEPA value concentrations in streams of the Xeric West for full support of aquatic life and drinking water standards. Results showed that TN exceeded the USEPA-reference condition of 0.36 mg TN/L in all samples, while 96% of the samples exceeded the USEPA-recommended TP concentration value of 0.1 mg/L. All samples showed NO3-N concentrations below the USEPA drinking-water standard of 10 mg/L. The only nutrient component in irrigation runoff that was strongly related to SL was PP concentration (r = 0.87). For TKN, significant concentration and load reduction between control and the other four erosion control practices (P < 0.05) occurred only in vineyard A. As for PP, the four PAM integrated control practices showed statistically significant effects with respect to the PAM control in vineyard B only. Although PAM is an excellent practice to control soil erosion with widespread adoption, additional off-site treatment may be needed for nutrient concentrations in irrigation return flows to meet reference conditions that would fully support aquatic life.

Redundancy detrended analysis was used to assess the relationship between bird abundance and seven linear habitat variables in ninety-four 150m sections.ResultsSylvia warblers differed in habitat requirements, however heterogeneity affected their distribution to the greatest extent. In addition, Barred Warbler preferred high shrub volume and wider sections, whereas Common Whitethroat was attracted by brambles and nettles and Lesser Whitethroat favoured shrubs. All species avoided a high proportion of low vegetation.Conclusion Structural heterogeneity resulted in highly preferred linear habitats for Sylvia warblers. Thus, maintaining or increasing structural heterogeneity of linear habitats may be a very effective tool for the conservation of farmland bird populations.","2013","2020-10-29 20:16:02","2020-10-29 20:16:02","","484-490","","","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aims of this study were to evaluate visual impacts of the General Agri-Environmental Protection Scheme (GAEPS) and Supplementary Protection Scheme (SPS) and general, attitudes towards some activities in those policies and furthermore to examine the suitability of the method of Alho et al. (2001) for the scenic beauty assessment. The study areas consisted of three original, untreated, and 15 modified rural landscapes representing a variety of different activities. The scenic beauty of the landscapes was evaluated through pairwise comparisons of the responses of 68 people. Furthermore, attitudes towards environmental values, water protection, buffer strips and subsidies to agriculture were obtained. The respondents found the maintained buffer strips more pleasing than unmaintained strips and considered that the quality of watercourses was increased by buffer strips along them. A suitable width for the buffer strip along main ditches, brooks and waterways was regarded, on average, to be wider than the current recommendations. Although the opinions of farmers were basically in line with the existing recommendations, farmers' opininons on the second and third most important effects of buffer strips, an increase in weeds and a decrease in cultivated land, clearly differed from those of the other respondents. Afforestation, lack of building maintenance and abandoned fields were considered to be the most important factors impacting rural landscapes. This study indicates that the Finnish Agri-Environmental Protection Schemes have had positive impacts on the visual quality of landscapes. Attitudes towards other impacts are contradictory. This study also showed the improvement of the Alho et al. (2001) method in these kinds of studies relative to other methods of pairwise comparisons.

Farmland is readily divisible into linear habitats such as hedges, and non-linear habitats such as fields and woodlots. In agricultural landscapes, conservationists have generally focused on enhancing linear habitats, but there are few data from which to judge whether or not this is a good strategy for biodiversity. 2. We investigated whether the linear or non-linear character of habitat patches, mediated by edge effects, has an impact on the abundance, diversity and richness of the small mammal communities that live within and between them. 3. In particular, we hypothesized, first, that edge effects cause narrow linear habitats to be avoided by specialists such as the bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus, but not by generalists such as the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus; secondly, that edge effects lead to specialists being present in atypical habitat, through excursions at the interface between two habitats. 4. We tested these hypotheses by live-trapping small mammals in grids in the centres of three non-linear farmland habitats (woodlots, set-aside and crop fields) and in field boundaries consisting of a series of adjoining linear habitats. We compared mammal communities in the non-linear habitats with the field boundary as a whole, and with the individual linear habitat elements within the boundary. 5. There was no evidence that specialists avoided linear habitats. Indeed, the field boundary was the most species-rich habitat surveyed, and bank voles were more abundant in linear hedgerow than in non-linear woodland. Bank voles were present in linear set-aside and in the crop edge, but never in non-linear blocks of set-aside or crop, implying that they diffused out of the hedgerow into the adjacent habitats. There was no evidence of an effect of habitat linearity on field voles Microtus agrestis, wood mice or common shrews Sorex araneus. 6. Our results suggest that on uncropped land such as set-aside, the linear or non-linear character of habitats will make little difference to small mammal abundance and diversity. We advocate similar assessments for other taxa so that the effects of farm management and habitat configuration on biodiversity can be understood more fully.","2002","2020-10-29 20:16:09","2021-10-19 13:14:20","","643-652","","","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we focus on changes resulting from removal of land from arable production under the set-aside scheme. Wood mice were radio-tracked to compare: (a) their use of set-aside, crop and hedgerow before and after harvest; (b) set-aside configured as margins and as a 3 ha block; (c) cut and uncut 20-m wide set-aside margins. Males had larger home ranges, and were more mobile than females. Ranges were larger, and animals more mobile, before harvest than afterwards. There were no differences in range sizes of breeding and non-breeding animals after harvest, suggesting that changes in habitat use were not a function of cessation of breeding. Before harvest, wood mice used habitats within their ranges at random, and their ranges contained a high proportion of cropped area. After harvest they preferred hedgerow and avoided margin set-aside within their ranges, but did not similarly avoid the set-aside block. The proportion of cropped area within their ranges decreased after harvest, and the proportion of margin increased. Our evidence suggests wood mice avoided using the area adjacent to the hedgerow, perhaps to avoid predators. Uncut set-aside patches were favoured and cut patches avoided, possibly in response to differences in food availability and levels of protection from predators. These results confirm that wood mice are useful indicators of change in arable landscapes.","2001","2020-10-29 20:16:11","2021-10-19 13:14:14","","487-494","","","255","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2000 the Commonwealth of Virginia, USA, began an extensive cooperative venture under the Chesapeake Bay Initiative to establish riparian buffers on agricultural lands, primarily through United States Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CPEP). Prior to CREP implementation, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) developed a regionally tailored fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for use as a watershed assessment technique in Northern Virginia. Using this regional IBI framework, we evaluated the effects of recently established riparian buffers on aquatic condition. Within the geographic scope of the regional 01, we evaluated all buffer segments planned between 2000 and 2003. Cumulatively during this period, we assessed stream physical condition on 36 buffer sites and 12 reference sites using the NRCS Stream Visual Assessment Protocol (SVAP); we also assessed the aquatic community at these sites using the IBI. Improvements in stream condition were clearly demonstrated at certain sites within one year of buffer establishment. Although not all buffer projects responded with positive trends, mean SVAP and IBI scores for buffered sites increased over the course of the study, whereas the trend on reference sites was level or slightly downward. We observed positive 01 response at sites with highly disturbed local conditions prior to buffer establishment combined with small, relatively undisturbed watersheds above. Simple solutions such as buffer establishment alone cannot be expected to protect streams from adverse human impacts that occur at a broader scale. Therefore, riparian restoration should be planned and carried out in concert with other conservation practices at a watershed scale in a way that maximizes buffer effectiveness.","2006","2020-10-29 20:16:12","2020-10-29 20:16:12","","927-935","","","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pitfall traps were used to assess the carabid beetle fauna in mid-summer between 1993 and 1996. Suction sampling was used to assess a wider range of arthropod taxa in June 1994. Pitfall data showed no significant overall effects from plot-type although significant differences in carabid activity-density were found between fields and years. In contrast, suction sampling showed marked differences between the crop, the hedge and the plots with different vegetation structures. There was a significant positive correlation between faunal and floral diversity, with arthropod diversity lowest in the crop, low in the crop edge, higher in the more diverse sown plots and highest in the hedge. Studies of over-wintering arthropods from soil samples revealed similar trends, confirming that arthropods colonised sown margin strips within 11-15 months of establishment. The results indicate that the appropriate scale for using pitfall traps is at the field rather than the plot scale. The introduction of botanically diverse field margin strips is shown to be an important method of increasing the arthropod diversity of semi-natural habitat in farmland.","1999","2020-10-29 20:16:16","2020-10-29 20:16:16","","131-144","","","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","United Kingdom; eppi-reviewer4; Amble field margin; Carabid; Insect; Over-wintering; Pitfall trap; Suction sampler","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the spatial dynamics of insect distributions in farmland can provide insights into their ecological requirements and potential for management. Identifying the scale, location and persistence of species' aggregations is an important step towards understanding the factors driving population distributions. This study examined how different carabid species were distributed in field and field margin habitats, and analysed their spatiotemporal dynamics. 2. We sampled 156 locations in a grid of pitfall traps over approximately 1 ha, comprising a hedgerow and adjacent parts of two arable fields. Traps were monitored between June and November 1994 to provide data with high spatial and temporal resolution of the two-dimensional distributions of six carabid beetle taxa. 3. The pattern of carabid activity-density over the experimental site was displayed in a series of contour plots. Spatial analyses by distance indices (SADIE) were used to provide aggregation indices (I a) for the distributions of carabid species at different times. 4. A second SADIE index (I m) of spatial association between two sets of counts was used to measure the spatial stability of species' aggregation patterns through time. I m was also used to measure association or dissociation between the distributions of different species, and the spatial association between a species' distribution and an environmental variable. 5. Each taxon was aggregated most of the time, but different taxa aggregated in patches within the field and/or hedgerow to different and varying extents. The field boundaries were important for some species, either as the only habitat in which they occurred (Amara spp.), as the major focus of more widespread distribution (Harpalus rufipes), or as a seasonal refuge (Nebria brevicollis). Within the crop habitat, different species also occupied different areas, providing some evidence to suggest species packing in space. 6. Spatial distributions between consecutive samples were strongly and positively associated, indicating stability of patch location over short time-scales. The strength of the association in turn was correlated with activity-density. When time lags were introduced between sample distributions, some negative association indices indicated displacement of patches. In most cases, however, positive association was maintained over long periods, demonstrating patch stability. 7. The spatial stability of patches suggests that future studies should focus on the detailed measurement of biotic and abiotic factors associated with patch location. Identifying the underlying causes of population distributions in farmland has important implications for managing habitat to enhance populations of beneficial predators, and targeting insecticide applications in precision agriculture to minimize their adverse side-effects.","2001","2020-10-29 20:16:17","2020-10-29 20:16:17","","100-116","","","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4; Carabidae; Field margin; Coleoptera; Farmland insect distributions; Patch; SADIE; Spatial dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this manuscript, we aimed to evaluate which hedger- ow attribute was best at predicting avian densi- ties in a conventional and organic farming landscape. Furthermore, we wished to investi- gate if these same hedgerow attributes could explain arthropod family density, richness and diversity, and how these were correlated to avian densities. An information theory-based multimodel inference method was used to iden- tify which factors influenced variability in avian densities. Although not always significant, avian densities increased with arthropod rich- ness at our study sites. Ecotone width is the best predictor of avian densities and arthropod richness while percent gap is the most impor- tant factor if a manager wishes to increase avian diversity (H') in hedgerow habitats. Increasing ecotone width benefits both avian densities and arthropod richness that in turn further increases bird numbers in our farming landscape.","2011","2020-10-29 20:16:20","2021-10-19 13:13:41","","9-23","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, research has mainly focussed on such predators. Establishment guidelines for these features, which are considered as inexpensive substitutes for the considerable amount of hedgerows that have been lost in the UK, are available, as is some funding, but long-term management guidance is lacking. The botanical composition and diversity of a range of beetle banks was examined in southern UK over two summers and a winter, and compared with that of typical, adjacent field margins including grassy strips and hedgebanks, with a view to indicating potential management requirements.Beetle banks had lower species richness and H′ diversity than field margins, but these characteristics increased with age of the bank until those over a decade old had approximately equal diversity. Few individual plant species were found exclusively in either habitat. Beetle banks provided more grass cover, especially tussock, but less herbaceous cover and fewer nectar-providing plants compared with field margins. Weed cover was not significantly different between habitat types, and varied considerably. This may concern some farmers, particularly when economically threatening species are present, although crop encroachment may be minimal and control is relatively straightforward. Overall, beetle banks appear to retain a dense vegetational structure, despite increasing botanical diversity, and are of value as refuge habitat for predatory invertebrates for over a decade. Increasing floral diversity may benefit beneficial invertebrates. As simple, inexpensive features, beetle banks provide a means of dividing fields and enhancing farmland biodiversity, while requiring minimal management.

This can encourage individual landholders to maintain vegetation even when there are costs in terms of a reduction in crop area as well as maintenance of the vegetation. Here we investigated abundance of natural enemies in 61 vineyards from south eastern Australia, with either adjacent woody vegetation consisting of remnant native forests or wooded margins planted after establishment of the crop, or lacking in adjacent vegetation. Invertebrates were sampled five times at monthly intervals using canopy sticky traps. There was an increase in abundance of different groups of natural enemies when woody vegetation was present although these increases depended on size. Small natural enemies tended to be influenced by local features, whereas larger potentially more mobile groups were not affected. Predation of eggs of a vineyard insect pest, Epiphyas postvittana, was relatively higher in vineyards with either adjacent remnant forest or planted woody vegetation. Various types of local vegetation may therefore encourage a range of predators and parasitoids, increasing predation and control of a common vineyard pest.

Field results showed the buffer reduced groundwater NO3-N concentration moving to the stream over a five-year period. REMM was calibrated hydrologically using daily field-measured water table depths (WTDs), and with monthly NO3-N concentrations in groundwater wells.

This study's objectives were to determine accumulation of sediment and phosphorus in a multi-species riparian buffer and characterize spatial-temporal patterns of phosphorus in soil water and groundwater. The buffer was planted in 2000, below a steep-sloping field in row-crop production under no-tillage management in a Iowa's Loess Hills. Topographic surveys were conducted in 2002, after the buffer was fully established, and again in 2005. Mapped differences in elevation showed sediment accretion was associated with concentrated flow pathways and lateral flow along the buffer-crop margin. About 32% of the buffer's outer switchgrass (Panicum Virgatum L.) zone had sediment accumulations exceeding 4 cm (1.6 in), which totaled 14.5 Mg ha-1 (over three years) contributing area, or 4.8 Mg ha-1 yr-1 (2.1 t ac-1 yr-1). Among five soil plots, total phosphorus in accreted sediment varied from 7 to 55 g m-2 (0.02 to 0.18 oz ft--2) totaling 9.6 kg P ha--1 (8.5 lb P ac-1) contributing area. Phosphorus concentrations in soil water were greatest beneath the switchgrass, compared to the crop and .the buffer's inner vegetation zones (p < 0.05). Concentrations in soil water and groundwater were also greater where sediment accumulated, presumably due to increased infiltration of runoff. Sediment and phosphorus trapping occurred despite no-tillage management on the contributing hillslope and relatively dry conditions during the study. This emphasizes the importance of installing multiple, complementary conservation practices in sensitive environments. Considering seasonal risks of runoff when selecting buffer species and anticipated runoff patterns when designing buffer areas could reduce subsurface phosphorus losses through riparian areas.

In this study, the rice pollen donor of non-glutinous Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. 'Tainung 67' [TNG 67] had a greater potential of pollen flow, which was shown by the greater quantity, germination rate, and viability of pollen, than the other rice pollen donor of transgenic AAN. The pollen-mediated gene flow was detected by the frequency of outcrossed seeds in a ""checker-board pattern"" and alternating row arrangement of rice pollen donor (TNG 67 or AAN) and pollen recipient (glutinous rice 'TNG 73') in the fields. We conducted field experiments to assess rice pollen dispersal with or without a ""green"" fence of Chinese hibiscus, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L., of approximately 2 m in height and 0.6 m in thickness. Without a green fence, the outcrossing rate of TNG 73 seeds decreased with increasing distance from the pollen donor, from 1.68% at 1 m to 0.01% at 35 m, with no outcrossing beyond 40 m. The outcrossing rate varied with the direction of pollen donor, from 0.05% in the northeastern direction to 0.78% in the southern direction, which was caused by prevailing wind direction. With the green fence, no seeds of TNG 73 were outcrossed. Since a buffer zone of at least 40 m is needed to prevent outcrossing of nice by pollen dispersal in an open field, planting of Chinese hibiscus around the rice field as a green fence would be an effective measure for preventing transgene escape mediated by pollen flow.","2012","2020-10-29 20:16:24","2020-10-29 20:16:24","","100-108","","","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Australia, shelterbelts are widely planted to provide protection for livestock and to counter salinity problems associated with rising water tables. Shelterbelts may also play a role in acting as reservoirs for organisms that are beneficial to pastures, although this has rarely been directly evaluated. We sampled invertebrates along transects running from replicated shelterbelts into pastures, and in glasshouse trials we tested the impact of the beneficial organisms from the shelterbelts on the collected pests. Contrary to popular views, numbers of pest mites and lucerne fleas were low within shelterbelts. Moreover, numbers were typically lower adjacent to shelterbelts compared with >30 m into the pasture, an effect that was much more apparent when shelterbelts carried a groundcover of high (>30 cm) grass. Numbers of predatory mites and spiders were higher in shelterbelts and in adjacent pasture when there was taller grass and higher grass cover in the shelterbelts.

This study was conducted in multi-species riparian buffers, cool-season grass buffers and adjacent crop fields to determine biomass, carbon, nitrogen and soil respiration dynamics. The multispecies buffers were composed of poplar ( Populus × euroamericana' Eugenei ) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.). Crop fields were under annual corn-soybean rotation. Aboveground biomass was determined by clipping grasses in 25 x 25 cm quadrats. The dynamics of fine (0-2 mm) and small roots (2-5 mm) were assessed by sequentially collecting 5.4 cm diameter, 35 cm deep cores for the first year and 125 cm deep cores for the second year from April through November. Coarse roots were described by excavating 1 x 1 x 2 in pits and collecting all roots in 20 cm depth increments. Root distributions within the soil profile were determined by counting roots that intersected the walls of the excavated pits. Soil respiration was measured monthly from July 1996 to July 1998 using the soda-lime technique. Over the sampling period, live fine-root biomass and root C and N in the riparian buffers were significantly higher than in the crop fields. Poplar had the greatest aboveground live biomass and N and C, while switchgrass had highest aboveground dead biomass, C and N. Roots of trees, cool-season grasses, and switchgrass extended to more than 1.5 m in depth, with switchgrass roots being more widely distributed in deeper horizons. Root density was significantly greater under switchgrass and cool-season grasses than under corn or soybean. Soil respiration was significantly greater in both buffer systems than in the cropped fields. Annual soil respiration rates correlated strongly with soil organic carbon (R = 0.75, P < 0.001) and fine root (<2 min) biomass (R = 0.85, P < 0.001). Abundant fine roots, deep rooting depths, and high soil respiration rates in the multispecies riparian buffer zones suggest that these buffer systems added more organic matter to the soil profile, and therefore provided better conditions for nutrient sequestration within the riparian buffers.","2000","2020-10-29 20:16:25","2020-10-29 20:16:25","","","104-104 p.","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","ISBN: 9780599973039; 059997303X","","","","Biomass; Ecology; Botany; Biological sciences; 0329:Ecology; Forestry; Nitrogen; Carbon; eppi-reviewer4; 0478:Forestry; Riparian buffers; 0817:Botany; Crop fields; Soil respiration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study was conducted in riparian cool-season grass buffers, in re-established multispecies (switchgrass + poplar) riparian buffers and in adjacent crop (maize and soybean) fields. The objectives were to determine the variability in soil respiration among buffer types and crop fields within a riparian landscape, and to identify those factors correlating with the observed differences. Soil respiration was measured approximately monthly over a two-year period using the soda-lime technique. Mean daily soil respiration across all treatments ranged from 0.14 to 8.3 g C m(-2) d(-1). There were no significant differences between cool-season grass buffers and re-established forest buffers, but respiration rates beneath switchgrass were significantly lower than those beneath cool-season grass. Soil respiration was significantly greater in both buffer systems than in the cropped fields. Seasonal changes in soil respiration were strongly related to temperature changes. Over all sites, soil temperature and soil moisture together accounted for 69% of the seasonal variability in soil respiration. Annual soil respiration rates correlated strongly with soil organic carbon (R = 0.75, P < 0.001) and fine root (<2 mm) biomass (R = 0.85, P < 0.001).

Growing-season mean biomass, C and N pools were greater in the multispecies buffer than in either of the crop fields or cool-season grass buffers. Rates of C accumulation in plant and litter biomass in the planted poplar and switchgrass stands averaged 2960 and 820 kg C ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. Nitrogen immobilization rates in the poplar stands and switchgrass sites averaged 37 and 16 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), respectively.

We also examined time series of velocity from sonic anemometers placed against the upstream and downstream faces of the hedge, forming statistics over averaging intervals selected by the criterion that lowpass filtered wind direction should never reverse to exchange the 'upwind' and 'downwind' sides.

The objective of this study was to compare the effects of agroforestry and grass buffers on computed tomography (CT)-measured macropore (diam. > 1000 mu m) and coarse mesopore (diam. 200-1000 mu m) parameters within 0.50 m soil profiles and to examine relationships between CT-measured pore parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat). Undisturbed soil cores (76 mm diam. by 76 mm long) from a no-till corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.; RC) rotation, grass buffer (GB), and agroforestry buffer (AB) treatments were collected with six replicates from the 0- to 0.50-m depth in 0.10-m increments on a Putnam silt loam (fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Albaqualf). Five CT images were acquired throughout each soil core using a medical CT scanner with 0.2 by 0.2 mm pixel resolution and 0.5 mm slice thickness. Soil pore parameters including number of pores, number of macropores, number of coarse mesopores, porosity, macroporosity, coarse mesoporosity, and fractal dimension were analyzed using ImageJ software. Treatment and depth effects were significant for all seven parameters. These seven pore parameters were different between row crop and buffer treatments as well as grass and agroforestry buffer treatments. The GB and AB treatments had 26 and 36 macropores per 2500-mm(2) area, respectively. These numbers were 2 and 2.6 times greater than 14 macropores in the RC treatment. No macropores were detected in the 40 to 50 cm, depth of the RC treatment. The fractal dimension of macroporosity for the agroforestry treatment was 1.2 and 1.1 times greater than row crop and grass buffer treatments, respectively. Soil bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity were significantly different among the treatments. The fractal dimension accounted for 76% of the variability in K-sat. This study concludes that establishment of permanent vegetative buffers improves CT-measured soil parameters and these CT-measured parameters may be used to quantify the effects of management relative to environmental benefits and improved water transport and retention models.

Agroforestry, a land management practice that intersperses agricultural crops with trees, has recently received increased attention in the temperate zone due to its environmental and economic benefits. However, studies are limited that have examined buffer effects on the quality of water from grazed pastures. Six treatment areas, two with agroforestry buffers, two with grass buffers, and two control treatments were used to test the hypothesis that agroforestry and grass buffers can be used to effectively reduce NPSP from pastured watersheds. Vegetation in grass buffer and pasture areas includes red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) and lespedeza (Kummerowia stipulacea Maxim.) planted into fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.). Eastern cottonwood trees (Populus deltoides Bortr. ex Marsh.) were planted into fescue in agroforestry buffers. Soils at the site are mostly Menfro silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludalfs). Treatments were instrumented with two-foot H flumes, water samplers, and flow measuring devices in 2001. Composite water samples were analyzed for sediment and total nitrogen after each runoff event to compare treatment differences. Treatments with agroforestry and grass buffers had significantly lower runoff volumes as compared to the control. The loss of sediment and total nitrogen were smaller for the buffered treatments. The results of this study suggest that establishment of agroforestry and grass buffers help reduce NPSP pollution from pastured watersheds. It is anticipated as trees grow and roots occupy more soil volume, the reduction in N in runoff will increase on the agroforestry watershed.","2010","2020-10-29 20:16:30","2020-10-29 20:16:30","","81-87","","","79","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Effects of precipitation, landuse and buffer condition on runoff and sediment loss were examined from 1997 to 1999 in eight watersheds with varying proportions of row-crop, pasture, riparian buffers and grass filter strips. Runoff volume and sediment mass from row-crop watersheds were inversely related to the percentage of forest and pasture cover. Forest (n = 2), pasture (n = 3), row-crop (n = 2) and a row-crop watershed with grass filter strips (RC-GFS) had 3-yr mean runoff of 939, 1,560, 3,434 and 1,175 m3 ha-1 yr1, respectively. Runoff was greater from all landuses in a year when precipitation was 36% above normal (1998). The largest single runoff event from each watershed accounted for 11 to 25% of its total runoff. Forest, pasture, row-crop and RC-GFS watersheds lost 1,017, 1,241, 3,679 and 2,129 kg ha-1 yr-1 of sediment, respectively. In 1998, the RC-GFS watershed lost more sediment than row-crop watersheds and had less runoff and sediment loss in years with normal or below normal precipitation. Row-crop watersheds with 55% pasture reduced runoff and sediment loss by 55 and 66%, respectively, compared to row-crop watersheds. During 90% of the runoff events, more soil was lost from row-crop watersheds than pasture or forest watersheds.

Mean shoot growth rate of pin oak was the highest during the whole study period, while swamp white and bur oak grew at the same rate until the fourth growing season. During the fifth growing season, growth rate of bur oak was the lowest. The root system of pin oak appears to be concentrated close to the tree, thus strengthening the buffer strips and competing least with the crop. The shallow root system of swamp white oak may best scavenge leaching nutrients from subsurface flow, thus reducing nonpoint source pollution. Sapling survival, growth rate, and rooting pattern suggest that pin oak and swamp white oak have a better potential for agroforestry practices in the Midwest than bur oak.","2005","2020-10-29 20:16:31","2021-10-19 13:14:02","","602-609","","","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most previous studies have focused primarily on the role of vegetation and/or soil physical properties in these ecosystem services. Few studies have investigated the soil microbial community of VFS. Therefore, we examined potential differences in soil microbial community characteristics of claypan soil planted to VFS with differing vegetation and a traditional row-crop system in a maize-soybean rotation. Samples were tested for soil microbial function and community structure using dehydrogenase and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis enzyme assays and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, respectively. The grass VFS soil exhibited the greatest dehydrogenase activity levels and FDA activity was greater in the grass and agroforestry (i.e., tree-grass) VFS soils relative to the cropland soil. The PLFA analysis revealed community structural differences underlying these functional differences. The agroforestry VFS soil was characterized by a greater proportion of total bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, anaerobic bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi than the cropland soil. The grass VFS soil shared some characteristics with the cropland soils; but the grass VFS supported greater mycorrhizal fungi and protozoa populations. This work highlights differences in soil microbial function and community structure in VFS relative to cropland soil 12 years post VFS establishment. It also enhances our fundamental knowledge regarding soil microorganisms in VFS, which may aid in explaining some ecosystem services provided by VFS (e.g., decomposition of organic agrichemicals).","2013","2020-10-29 20:16:32","2021-10-19 13:14:24","","395-402","","","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A 6-plot experimental field was established in clay soil (Vertic Cambisol) in SW Finland in 1991 to study long-term changes in functioning of BZs and their retention capacity for total solids (TS), total P (TP), dissolved reactive P (DRP) and particulate P (PP) in different seasons. The steep slope in lower sections of four plots (18m wide×70m long) was planted with 10-m-wide mowed grass buffer zones (GBZ) or unmowed vegetated buffer zones (VBZ) growing natural herbage and shrubs. Surface runoff water samples from the GBZ and VBZ plots were compared to samples from plots cultivated without a buffer (NBZ). The source field area in all plots and the steep slope (12–18%) on the NBZ were ploughed in autumn, and sown with barley (Hordeum vulgare) or oats (Avena sativa) in spring (conventional tillage, 1991–2001), sown with grass and grazed (72–234 cow grazing days ha−1 yr−1; 2003–2005) and direct drilled without tillage (2006–2008). Surface soil samples (0–2cm) were taken from the BZs in autumn and spring to evaluate the level of plant-available P (P Ac) extracted with 0.5M NH4–acetate–0.5M acetic acid at pH 4.65. The BZs were most effective at decreasing TS, TP and PP with conventional tillage, less so with direct drilling and least effective with grazing. In a conventionally tilled field, the TS and TP removal efficiencies were over 50% and 27–36%, respectively, for the BZs as compared to the NBZ. In the VBZ plots, the DRP load was, however, 60% greater than in the NBZ or GBZ plots. In direct drilling, the surface runoff losses were smaller than in conventionally tilled NBZ plots. The lowest losses of TS, TP and PP were found during grazing for all plots, but with grazing the DRP load, 0.3–0.4kgha−1 yr−1, was higher than during grain growing in all treatments. The GBZ and VBZ were effective in retaining P in summer and autumn, whereas in spring their retention capacity was decreased. The reason for high DRP losses in spring was the high P Ac in surface soil and frozen broken plant tissues in the VBZ and the grazed source field. Mowing and removing of swathe from the GBZ decreased the DRP losses.

Ecological theory predicts that complex plant communities should support a richer community of natural enemies of pest insects than a simple plant community. A study was conducted in Iowa, USA to investigate the influence of the vegetative diversity of field boarders on the activity, species richness, and community similarities of predatory beetles occurring in corn fields. Ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) populations were compared among corn fields bounded by either complex hedges or simple grass edges. Directional pitfall traps were used to investigate activity patterns of beetles between border types and their adjacent corn fields. Beetles were trapped during four seasonal periods, based on the growth stage of corn. During corn emergence (May-June) when fields are barren, carabids were more active and species richness was higher in the corn fields bordered by woody hedges. The carabid species Scarites quadriceps, Scarites subterraneus, and Harpalus pensylvanicus, were more dominant in hedge sites as compared to grass sites at this time. Following corn-canopy closure, carabids were now more active in fields bordered by grassy edges, but beetle activity also remained high in the fields adjacent to woody hedges. Further analysis of the carabid communities by Bray-Curtis Similarity Index showed no difference among field edge types at any time of the season. Results indicate that both complex and simple field border habitats support abundant and diverse populations of carabids during most of the growing season. However, during the early growing season hedges appear to be more important than grass edges in supplying carabid beetles to corn fields. Woody hedges may serve as very important overwintering sites and as an early season refuge for predatory beetles in corn. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.","2001","2020-10-29 20:16:39","2021-10-19 13:14:10","","153-163","","","83","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One response to this has been the use of vegetative filter zones (VFZ) at the point of origin of the pollution (i.e. where water leaves agricultural fields, feedlots and barnyards) or, more commonly, at the point of entry of NPSP into surface waters (i.e. wetlands and riparian areas). The studies presented in this dissertation examined surface and subsurface processes that accounted for nitrogen pollutant removal in forested filter zones (FFZ) where runoff was artificially dispersed on two agricultural watersheds in Oxford, N.C. Surface processes were studied by constructing nitrogen budgets for the surface 30 cm of each FFZ. Subsurface processes were studied by measuring changes in groundwater chemistry along transects from the field edges to the forest edge and below the FFZ1. Two additional experiments were conducted whereby nitrate and a conservative tracer, bromide, were introduced into the soil profile at different depths and attenuation was measured by intercepting the solute plume at different distances form the point of introduction. A laboratory incubation was conducted to determine the effect of short-term (1 to 2 years) exposure of FFZ soils to nutrient laden runoff on denitrification potential and denitrification rates at different depths in the soil profile. Results indicated that infiltration was essential for removal of nitrogen pollutants from surface runoff. The major N influxes through surface runoff from the agricultural fields occurred during the spring. During this period, leaching losses were low due to the presence of a high water table. Nitrogen retained by the FFZ during this period was taken up by the vegetation. Denitrification was the primary process that accounted for nitrate removal from subsurface water. The efficiency of nitrate removal via denitrification was closely associated with dissolved organic carbon. Dispersal of agricultural runoff enhanced denitrification potential within the FFZ, suggesting that this practice had a favorable effect on the soil microbial population. This did not translate to enhanced denitrification under ambient carbon conditions where nitrate reduction in subsoils was higher in soil samples from areas that did not receive agricultural effluent, suggesting that changes in the nature of the organic carbon may also have occurred. FFZ that are designed for the removal of N species from surface runoff should not be located on sites where seepage is present during the winter and spring because this prohibits infiltration and removal of dissolved N species, particularly nitrate, from runoff. In addition, these sites may become net contributors to nitrate in runoff. In subsurface drainage, carbon is the essential determining element for the effectiveness of VFZ in nitrate removal. Forest lands, particularly forested riparian areas, by nature of their deeper root systems than herbaceous vegetation, will have greater available carbon deeper in the soil profile and will be more effective at nitrate removal.","1994","2020-10-29 20:16:40","2020-10-29 20:16:40","","","183-183 p.","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A modified two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) with subsamples was used to compare SOC and TN on a concentration, soil volume and soil mass basis in claypan soils planted to different conservation management practices and as a function of landscape position. The three conservation management practices (no-till cultivation, grass VFS and agroforestry VFS) and four landscape positions (summit, shoulder, backslope and footslope) investigated were compared 10years after VFS establishment in a no-till system planted to maize (Zea mays. L.)–soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) rotation. Two soil depth increments (0–5cm and 5–13cm) were modeled separately to test for treatment effects. In the surface layer, mean SOC concentration was significantly greater in the VFS soils compared to no-till. On a soil volume or mass basis, no significant differences in SOC stocks were found among treatment means. Concentration and mass based TN values were significantly greater in the grass VFS relative to no-till in the surface layer. A rapid slaking stability test, developed to separate particulate, adsorbed and occluded organic carbon (PAO-C) and nitrogen (PAO-N), showed that VFS soils had significantly greater mean PAO-C and PAO-N concentrations, soil volume and soil mass based stocks than no-till. In addition, comparison of SOC:TN and PAO-C:PAO-N ratios suggest reduced decomposition and mineralization of SOC in the PAO fraction. No significant treatment effects were detected in total or PAO soil fractions in the subsurface layer or among landscape position in either depth increment. Study results emphasize the need to compare soil carbon and nitrogen stocks on a soil volume and/or soil mass basis using bulk density measurements. Additionally, the rapid PAO separation technique was found to be a good indicator of early changes in SOC and TN in the systems studied. Overall, this research indicates that grass VFS may sequester TN more rapidly than agroforestry VFS and that a greater proportion of SOC and TN may be stabilized in VFS soils compared to no-till.

Yet, the short-term spatial and temporal variability in GHG emission in these systems is poorly understood. Using two transects of three static chambers at two North Carolina agricultural riparian zones (one restored, one unrestored), we show that estimates of the average GHG flux at the site scale can vary by one order of magnitude depending on whether the mean or the median is used as a measure of central tendency. Because the median tends to mute the effect of outlier points (hot spots and hot moments), we propose that both must be reported or that other more advanced spatial averaging techniques (e. g., kriging, areaweighted average) should be used to estimate GHG fluxes at the site scale. Results also indicate that shortterm temporal variability in GHG fluxes (a few days) under seemingly constant temperature and hydrological conditions can be as large as spatial variability at the site scale, suggesting that the scientific community should rethink sampling protocols for GHG at the soilatmosphere interface to include repeated measures over short periods of time at select chambers to estimate GHG emissions in the field. Although recent advances in technology provide tools to address these challenges, their cost is often too high for widespread implementation. Until technology improves, sampling design strategies will need to be carefully considered to balance cost, time, and spatial and temporal representativeness of measurements.","2015","2020-10-29 20:16:41","2021-10-19 13:14:44","","","","","187","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Steady state conditions at constant rainfall intensity were used to compare the effect of the different land uses on soil herbicide transport and dissipation parameters. For each herbicide, mobility was similar between grassed strip and cultivated soils while it was reduced in the forest soils. The descriptive and moment analyses of the experimental breakthrough curves of bromide and herbicides demonstrated a similar degree of physical non-equilibrium transport for the cropped and grassland soil columns, with transport ranging from a less intense physical non-equilibrium status to the complete physical equilibrium state for the forest soil columns. Chemical non-equilibrium transport was shown for the three situations. Degradation occurred in some columns as demonstrated by the elution of a metabolite of isoproturon. Previous data on sorption and degradation of isoproturon on the same soils were used to explain the differences observed in the analysis of the elution curves between grassed strip, forest and cultivated soil. Averaging K(d) values from individual soil layers of each profile gave a satisfying understanding of isoproturon retardation factors. Sorption on soil organic matter was the main factor in herbicide mobility. However, other phenomena such as degradation and formation of non-extractable residues were involved in the differences observed in leached masses of isoproturon between the three situations.","2007","2020-10-29 20:16:42","2021-10-19 13:14:13","","320-328","","","58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With buffer strips top-dressed with WTR (20 Mg ha(-1)), runoff total P (TP = 2.5 mg L-1) and total DP (TDP = 1.9 mg L-1) were not statistically lower (a = 0.05) compared to plots with unamended grass buffers (TP = 2.7 mg L-1; TDP = 2.6 mg L-1). Although the applied WTR had excess capacity (Langmuir P maxima of 25 g P kg(-1)) to sorb all runoff P, kinetic experiments suggest that sheet flow travel time across the buffers (similar to 30 s) was insufficient for significant P reduction. Effective interception of dissolved P in runoff water by WTR-enhanced buffer strips requires rapid P sorption kinetics and hydrologic flow behavior ensuring sufficient runoff residence time and WTR contact in the buffer. Substantial phosphate-adsorbent contact opportunity may be more easily achieved by incorporating WrRs into P-enfiched soils or blending WTRs with applied P sources.","2008","2020-10-29 20:16:43","2021-10-19 13:14:22","","1567-1574","","","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated the effectiveness of uncropped cultivated margins (UCM), spring fallow (SF) and cropped conservation headlands with (CH) or without fertiliser inputs (CH(NF)) in sustaining plant species diversity and rare species, in England, UK. Sampling was stratified at 1 m, 3 m and 5 m from the edge of the margin and in eight regions to assess environmental influences on species composition. Species diversity, including rare species, was highest on UCM, followed by SF and CH(NF) margins. Diversity was generally lower on cropped margins due to competition from the crop. Fertilised CH margins were the least diverse option and were similar to cereal crop controls. Species diversity was greatest at the edge of all except UCM margins and there was a strong latitudinal decline in overall diversity and rare species. AE management accounted for more variation in species composition than habitat context, physic al/climatic variables, soil properties or region. At cropped sites, there was overlap between margin type and other variables but soil properties explained less variation. At uncropped sites, management and physical/climate variables explained most variation but soil properties were more important than at cropped sites. These findings confirm that AE schemes are effective in conserving arable plants, including rare species, across a variety of landscape types. More precise geographical targeting, improved control of competitive species and research on the habitat requirements of rare species will improve the overall efficacy of schemes in the future.

Seven sites were analysed, which represented a large, but not complete, set of situations. We investigated the influence of hedges parallel to contour lines on soil characteristics, soil profile morphology and carbon storage at the hillslope scale. The analysis is based on a morphological description of the soil catena from the top of the hill to downslope of the hedge, and on measurements of bulk density and organic carbon in different soil profiles on the slopes. The results show that thickness of the organic horizon increases slowly from the top of the hill as far as the hedge, whereas under the hedge the bulk density is low and the soil organic carbon (SOC) storage large. Two effects of the hedges on SOC storage are apparent, namely, a local effect under the hedge, due to tree activity, and an anti-erosive effect at the hillslope scale. A rough approximation based on these data assessed the fraction of SOC storage attributed to the hedge network of between 13 and 38% of the total carbon stock.","2003","2020-10-29 20:16:45","2020-10-29 20:16:45","","201-207","","","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Land use; eppi-reviewer4; Hedge; Bocage; Bulk density; Organic carbon; A horizon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different management methods were applied for the buffers where grass and weeds were mowed 2-3 times during the second and third years and were not managed during the rest experimental years for the tree buffer, while grass was harvested 1-3 times per year for the pasture buffer. The differences between tree species and planting density significantly affected tree growth, but the growth difference did not significantly affect their capacities to reduce NO3-N in soil surface runoff and groundwater. On average for all the tree and pasture treatments, the buffer strips reduced NO3-N concentration by 8.5%, 14.7% and 14.4% for the surface runoff, shallow and deep groundwater respectively. The tree and pasture buffer strips were not significantly different in NO3-N reduction for both shallow and deep groundwater while the pasture buffer strips reduced significantly more NO3-N concentration in surface runoff than the tree buffer strips. Both buffer strips reduced more than 50% of surface runoff volume indicating that both the tree and pasture buffer strips were efficient at removing water and nutrients, mostly through a significant reduction in soil surface runoff volume.

Oystershell scale has a wide host range which includes trees frequently used as orchard shelter. The distribution of oystershell scale in apples adjacent to an infested shelter belt was investigated in Otago in 1995-96.Apple infestation was >90% next to the shelter and declined linearly to <1% 64 m away.The slope of this linear regression was similar on four cultivars of apple but infestation increased substantially from early- to late-harvested cultivars.The phenology of oystershell scale on apples in 1998-2000 was found to precede that on a range of other hosts, which extended the period of risk of fruit infestation by crawlers from December to April each year.Experiments were conducted in 1999-2000 on control of oystershell scale on a range of infested shelter trees using a vertical boom sprayer.Sprays timed for control of adult males and females in spring provided only a short-term reduction of winged males in sticky traps and failed to reduce crawler production and dispersal as measured by sticky bands and traps on tree branches.On the other hand, sprays timed for control of crawlers in mid-summer were effective in greatly reducing catches of crawlers.The options for management of oystershell scale on alternative hosts, particularly shelter, are discussed in relation to phenology, crop invasion by crawlers, host resistance and spraying. © 2011 The Royal Society of New Zealand.","2011","2020-10-29 20:16:47","2021-10-19 13:14:07","","35-49","","","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some of these contaminants can increase stream eutrophication and are suspected of contributing to hypoxic conditions in the Gulf of Mexico. This research quantified effects of livestock grazing management practices and vegetative filter strip buffers on runoff depth and mass losses of total solids, nitrate-nitrogen (NO(3)-N), and ortho-phosphorus (PO(4)-P) under natural hydrologic conditions. Runoff data were collected from 12 rainfall events during 2001 to 2003 at an Iowa State University research farm in central Iowa, United States. Three vegetative buffers (paddock area: vegetative buffer area ratios of 1:0.2, 1:0.1, and 1:0 no buffer [control]) and three grazing management practices (continuous, rotational, and no grazing [control]) comprised nine treatment combinations (vegetative buffer ratio/grazing management practice) replicated in three 1.35 ha (3.34 ac) plot areas. The total 4.05 ha (10.02 ac) study area also included nine 0.4 ha (1.0 ac) paddocks and 27 vegetative buffer runoff collection units distributed in a randomized complete block design. The study site was established on uneven terrain with a maximum of 15% slopes and consisted of approximately 100% cool-season smooth bromegrass. Average paddock and vegetative buffer plant tiller densities estimated during the 2003 project season were approximately 62 million and 93 million tillers ha(-1) (153 million and 230 million tillers ac(-1)), respectively. Runoff sample collection pipe leakage discovered and corrected during 2001 possibly reduced runoff depth and affected runoff contaminant mass losses data values. Consequently, 2001 runoff analysis results were limited to treatment comparisons, within the 2061 season and were not compared with 2002 and 2003 data. Analysis results from 2001 showed no significant differences in average losses of runoff, total solids, NO(3)-N, and PO(4)-P among the nine vegetative buffer/grazing practice treatment combinations. Results from 2002 indicated significantly higher losses of runoff and total solids from 1:0 no buffer/rotational grazing and 1:0 no buffer/continuous grazing treatment combination plots, respectively, compared among other 2002 season treatment combinations. The 2003 results showed significantly higher runoff and total solids losses from 1:0 no buffer/no grazing treatment combination plots compared among all 2003 treatment combinations and from 1:0.1 vegetative buffer/no grazing treatment combination plots compared among all 2003 treatment combinations and with respective 2002 treatment combinations. However, the 2003 results indicated effective vegetative buffer performance with significantly lower runoff, total solids, and NO(3)-N losses from the larger 1:0.2 buffer area compared among the smaller 1:0.1 buffer area and 1:0 no buffer treatment combinations. The 2003 results also indicated a highly significant increase in losses of NO(3)-N from 1:0.1 buffer/no grazing treatment combination plots compared among other 2003 season treatment combinations and with respective 2002 treatment combinations. Overall results from this study suggest a shift from significantly higher 2002 season plot losses Of Continuous and rotational grazing treatment combinations to significantly higher 2003 season losses of no grazing treatment combinations. We speculate this shift to significantly higher runoff and contaminantlosses from no grazing treatment combination plots during 2003 reflects the variability inherent to a complex and dynamic soil-water environmental of livestock grazing areas. however, we also hypothesize the environmental conditions that largely consisted of a dense perennial cool-season grass type, high-relief landscape, and relatively high total rainfall depth may not necessarily include livestock grazing activities.","2010","2020-10-29 20:16:49","2021-10-19 13:14:25","","34-41","","","65","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of our study was to examine the frequency of occurrence of forest species and total forest species richness in different parts of the hedgerows, and to relate these patterns of occurrence to the species' habitat requirements and life history traits. We surveyed in total 130 forest-hedgerow transects in North-western Germany, including three age classes. About 77% of all forest plant species (including some endangered taxa) occurring in the neighbouring forests were also found in the adjacent hedgerows. In all age classes, there was a negative relationship between distance from the forest-hedgerow ecotone and the number of species. Ancient hedgerows were not significantly more species-rich than more recent ones. Within 100 m distance from the forest edge, forest species richness increased with an increasing number of species in the nearby forest and with an increasing cover of the tree canopy as well as a decreasing cover of the shrub layer. Species with high frequency had comparatively high Ellenberg indicator values for light, and were mostly associated with anemochorous and epizoochorous seed dispersal. The frequency of occurrence in hedgerows of species with common attributes was partly in agreement, partly in disagreement with the results obtained in previous studies. We conclude that patterns are difficult to generalize, probably due to a strong regional variation in the pool of forest species and in the specific environments of both forests and hedgerows. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The modern intensive land use is responsible for this development. A new Swiss agropolicy aims to sustain biodiversity on farmland by introducing ecological compensation sites, e.g. wild flower strips. 2 This study investigates the hypothesis that wild flower strips are a habitat with high relative use by skylarks for foraging. Additionally, the factors which influence feeding frequency and differences between both sexes were investigated. During the breeding season, the habitat use of foraging skylarks was observed. The relative habitat use was calculated by compositional analysis. 3 Skylark females and males did not differ in their feeding rate. The age of the nestlings and the time of day influenced the feeding rate per hour and nestling, but there was no effect of the number of nestlings. 4 The habitats were ranked by the relative use for foraging: wild flower strips > stubble > tracks > grassland > root vegetables > maize > oil rape > spring cereals > winter cereals. Crop categories with low and sparse vegetation had a high relative use. Wild flower strips had the highest relative use in spite of their high and dense vegetation structure. 5 Wild flower strips are particularly attractive for foraging skylarks due to their heterogeneous vegetation structure and a high abundance of invertebrate food.","1998","2020-10-29 20:16:51","2021-10-19 13:14:15","","37-45","","","64","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, most headwater streams show structurally degraded channels, lacking riparian buff er zones, which are heavily loaded with nutrients from the surrounding crop fields. The present study examines whether longitudinally restricted riparian forest buffers can enhance the in-stream nutrient retention in nutrient-enriched headwater streams. We estimated nutrient uptake from pairwise, short-term addition experiments with (NH4)-N-15, NH4, PO4, and NaCl within reaches with riparian forest buffers (RFB) and degraded reaches (DEG) of the same streams. Riparian forest buffers originated from the conservation of the pristine vegetation or from restoration measures. Hydrologic retention was calculated with the model OTIS-P on the basis of conductivity breakthrough curves from the salt injections. A significant increase in surface transient storage was revealed in pristine and restored RFB reaches compared with DEG reaches due to the longitudinal step-pool pattern and the frequent occurrence of woody debris on the channel bed. Ammonium uptake lengths were significantly shorter in RFB reaches than in DEG reaches, resulting from the higher hydrologic retention. Uptake velocities did not differ significantly between RFB and DEG reaches, indicating that riparian forest buffers did not affect the biochemical nutrient demand. Uptake of (NH4)-N-15 was mainly driven by autotrophs. Net PO4 uptake was not affected by riparian forest buffers. The study shows that the physical and biogeochemical effects of riparian forest buffers on the in-stream nutrient retention are limited in the case of highly eutrophic streams.","2012","2020-10-29 20:16:52","2021-10-19 13:13:51","","373-379","","","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To accomplish this, ground beetle communities were sampled in potatoes and grassy field-margin habitats set in landscapes composed of varying amounts of natural area. At a local scale, field-margin habitats supported more, and different, carabid species than potatoes. Large carabids, brachypterous species, species typical of dry habitats and species that feed on seeds were all underrepresented in potatoes compared to field margins. However, the amount of field-margin habitat surrounding potatoes did not affect carabid community structure in the crop. At a larger scale, beetle diversity in potatoes increased and community composition changed with increases in the amount of natural area within 1.5km of the crop. However, this effect was not evident in adjacent field-margin habitats. These results suggest that the amount of natural area surrounding potatoes affects the composition of potential crop colonizers at a large spatial scale but that disturbances currently limit the types of species that colonize potatoes.

These organisms can disperse between non-crop habitats and crops and can benefit from resources in non-crop areas. Thus, it may be important to conserve non-crop habitats to maintain ecosystem services within crops. However, even single ecosystem services, such as pollination or predation of pests, may be provided by a complex of species. Different species may respond to landscape structure at differing spatial scales. This raises the question: What scales should conservation take place at to sustain an ecosystem service? Here, we examine variation in predation of two potato pests in response to landscape structure. Specifically, predation of Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, and green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, were quantified in potato and field-margin habitats set in landscapes that varied at different scales. At a local scale (meters), potato fields of different sizes were bordered by different areas of grassy field margin. At a broad scale (kilometers), these habitats were set in landscapes composed of varying percentages of non-crop habitat. Predation of both pests was associated with landscape structure, but this relationship occurred at different scales for each pest and interacted differently with habitat type. Predation of L. decemlineata eggs was greater in field margins than in the potato crop and increased in both habitats when field margins were large relative to potatoes. In contrast, aphid predation in field margins increased with the area of non-crop habitat within 1.5 km, but did not change in adjacent potato. These data emphasize that, even a single ecosystem service, such as predation of pests, can be influenced by landscape structure at multiple scales. More generally, it may be necessary to conserve heterogeneity both at local scales (individual farm fields) and broad scales (entire mosaic landscapes) to maintain ecosystem services. This may be especially true for ecosystem services that are the aggregate result of the actions of many species or ecological processes.","2010","2020-10-29 20:16:53","2021-10-19 13:14:25","","1114-1125","","","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Margins can also harbour plant species that are potentially injurious to the adjacent arable crop (undesirable species). Sowing perennial species in non-cropped buffer strips can reduce weed incidence, but limits the abundance of annuals with the potential to support wider biodiversity (desirable species). We investigated the responses of unsown plant species present in buffer strips established with three different seed mixes managed annually with three contrasting management regimes (cutting, sward scarification and selective graminicide). Sward scarification had the strongest influence on the unsown desirable (e.g. Sonchus spp.) and unsown pernicious (e.g. Elytrigia repens) species, and was generally associated with higher cover values of these species. However, abundances of several desirable weed species, in particular Poa annua, were not promoted by scarification. The treatments of cutting and graminicide tended to have negative impacts on the unsown species, except for Cirsium vulgare, which increased with graminicide application. Differences in unsown species cover between seed mixes were minimal, although the grass-only mix was more susceptible to establishment by C. vulgare and Galium aparine than the two grass and forb mixes. Annual scarification can enable desirable annuals and sown perennials to co-exist, however, this practice can also promote pernicious species, and so is unlikely to be widely adopted as a management tool in its current form.","2008","2020-10-29 20:16:54","2020-10-29 20:16:54","","113-123","","","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

YellowhammerEmberiza citrinellapopulations have declined rapidly in the UK over recent decades, and a clear understanding of their habitat requirements is important to help inform conservation schemes. We aimed to disentangle and rank the effects of winter versus breeding season habitat characteristics.2. We used information theoretic methods to analyse the factors determining yellowhammer distribution across 26 sites in England and Wales. We did this at two spatial levels: individual field boundaries and individual territories, the latter consisting of spatial clusters of boundaries.3. We considered the role of nine predictor variables, all of which have been suggested in the literature as potentially important. These comprised boundary height and width, and the presence of hedges, trees, ditches, boundary strips, tillage crops, winter set-aside and winter stubbles.4. The results of the statistical modelling showed that winter habitats play an important role in determining where birds locate territories in summer. In particular, the presence of rotational set-aside fields in winter showed the strongest association with summer territories.5. There were minor differences between the territory- and boundary-based models. Most notably, the territory data demonstrated a strong preference for territories containing trees, but this was not observed in the boundary data set. We suggest that the differences between the models may reflect different scales of habitat selection. Boundary occupancy reflects broad distributions of habitat suitability; territory occupancy patterns better reveal detailed habitat requirements.6. Regional densities were more closely correlated with the predictions of the boundary-based model than those of the territory-based model, and we discuss the implications of this for interpreting habitat association models.7. Synthesis and applications.Provision of winter set-aside fields for summer territory selection by yellowhammers is an important consideration for farm management where conservation is a priority. We show that models based on occupancy of individual boundary units (e.g. hedgerows) correlate with the density of territories at the farm scale; thus farm management practices link directly to population sizes through effects on the quality of breeding habitat.Journal of Applied Ecology(2005)doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01007.x [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Applied Ecology is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

The use of flowering vegetation has been widely advocated as a strategy for providing parasitoids and predators with nectar and pollen. However, their herbivorous hosts and prey may exploit floral food sources as well.2. Previous laboratory studies have shown that not all flower species are equally suitable in providing accessible nectar. Relatively little is known about actual nectar exploitation under field conditions.3. The present study investigates nectar exploitation by the pest, Plutella xylostella, and its parasitoid, Diadegma semiclausum, under field conditions and examines whether floral nectar exploitation in the field can be predicted based on controlled laboratory studies.4. Insects were collected from fields bordered by flowering margins containing Fagopyrum esculentum, Lobularia maritima, Anethum graveolens, Centaurea jacea or the grass Lolium perenne (control). Whole insect bodies were individually assayed by HPLC to establish their sugar profile as a measure of the level of energy reserves and the degree of food source use.5. The average overall sugar content of P. xylostella and D. semiclausum collected in fields bordered by flowering margins was significantly higher than those of individuals collected from grass-bordered control plots. To the authors' knowledge, this represents the first demonstration that nectar-providing plants enhance the energetic state of herbivores under field conditions.6. In contrast to earlier laboratory studies, the present study did not find elevated sugar contents in P. xylostella and D. semiclausum individuals collected from fields bordered by buckwheat (F. esculentum).7. The present study shows widespread sugar feeding by both the herbivore and its parasitoid. It also shows that laboratory studies establishing nectar exploitation under controlled conditions can not always be extrapolated to actual exploitation under field conditions. This emphasises the importance of studying field-collected insects with regard to food source use and nutritional status.","2009","2020-10-29 20:16:57","2021-10-19 13:14:28","","221-227","","","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to beneficial insects, many herbivores depend on floral food as well. The indiscriminate use of flowering species in field margins can therefore lead to higher pest numbers. Based on results from field observations and laboratory experiments we assessed risks as well as benefits associated with the provision of nectar plants in field margins, using Brussels sprouts as a model system. Results show that Brussels sprouts bordered by nectar plants suitable for the cabbage white Pieris rapae L., suffered higher infestation levels by this herbivore. In contrast, nectar plants providing accessible nectar for the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella L., did not raise densities of P. xylostella larvae in the Brassica crop. Margins with Anethum graveolens L., selected on the basis of its suitability as nectar plant for parasitoids, significantly increased the number of adult Diadegma semiclausum Hellen in the crop. This didn't translate into enhanced parasitism rates, as parasitism of P. xylostella by D. semiclausum exceeded 65 % in all treatments, irrespective of the plants in the field margin.

Three monitoring blocks that included groundwater quality wells, water table wells, and soil redox probes, were established in the buffer. NO3--N concentrations decreased significantly across the buffer in all of the monitoring blocks with mean reductions of 76-92%. Many biological processes, including denitrification and plant uptake, may have been responsible for the observed NO3-N reductions but could not be differentiated in this study.

A total of 73 nests were found in the autumn by careful searching of hedgerows, all of which were species-rich. In hedgerows that had not been cut for 6 years or more, most nests were in bramble Rubus fruticosus agg. and field rose Rosa arvensis margins, with a few in holly Ilex aquifolium bushes. In contrast, in hedgerows that had been cut within 6 years, the majority of nests were in shrubs, the dense protective growth at the cut line being strongly favoured.

Additionally, local-scale manipulations such as planting floral strips are used at the field-level to provide resources for beneficial insects to increase their services. It has been proposed that the benefits of local manipulations will depend on the landscape context, with greater benefits in simplified landscapes and smaller benefits in landscapes with an abundance of non-crop resources. To test this, we used soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, and its coccinellid predators as a model system to elucidate the effects of habitat management and landscape on biocontrol services in soybean. We selected pairs of soybean fields in landscapes of varying composition and planted buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum, strips adjacent to one field in each pair. We measured coccinellid abundance and biocontrol in each field. Coccinellid abundance was higher in buckwheat than in control field margins in all landscapes, and coccinellid abundance in soybean was positively related to amount of semi-natural vegetation in the landscape. We found no evidence of an interaction between landscape and local variables, and biocontrol services were high in all contexts. For soybean aphid suppression, landscape factors are the key drivers of predator abundance.

Although the importance of plant community assemblages in structuring invertebrate assemblages is well known, the role that architectural complexity plays is less well understood. In particular, direct empirical data for a range of invertebrate taxa showing how functional groups respond to plant architecture is largely absent from the literature. 2. The significance of sward architectural complexity in determining the species richness of predatory and phytophagous functional groups of spiders, beetles, and true bugs, sampled from 135 field margin plots over 2 years was tested. The present study compares the relative importance of sward architectural complexity to that of plant community assemblage. 3. Sward architectural complexity was found to be a determinant of species richness for all phytophagous and predatory functional groups. When individual species responses were investigated, 62.5% of the spider and beetle species, and 50.0% of the true bugs responded to sward architectural complexity. 4. Interactions between sward architectural complexity and plant community assemblage indicate that the number of invertebrate species supported by the plant community alone could be increased by modification of sward architecture. Management practices could therefore play a key role in diversifying the architectural structure of existing floral assemblages for the benefit of invertebrate assemblages. 5. The contrasting effects of sward architecture on invertebrate functional groups characterised by either direct (phytophagous species) or indirect (predatory species) dependence on plant communities is discussed. It is suggested that for phytophagous taxa, plant community assemblage alone is likely to be insufficient to ensure successful species colonisation or persistence without appropriate development of sward architecture.","2007","2020-10-29 20:17:01","2020-10-29 20:17:01","","302-311","","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ground beetles were divided into predatory and phytophagous trophic levels. Local habitat type only affected phytophagous ground beetle biomass, which was lowest within crops. Total biomass of predatory beetles was negatively correlated, and species richness positively correlated, with landscape habitat diversity. Only the functional diversity of predatory ground beetles responded to landscape structure, showing positive correlations with the proportion of Tussock Grass field margins. Predatory ground beetles show a greater dependence on landscape structure than phytophagous species, a response that is attributed to their high mobility needed for movement between dynamically variable food resources.

Three different sown seed mixtures were used to establish field margins, a Countryside Stewardship mix, a fine grass and forbs mix and a tussock grass and forbs mix. The structure of beetle communities in the first full year of establishment was found to show no difference between the tussock grass and Countryside Stewardship margins. However, both differed from the fine grass margins, which supported lower overall abundance and species richness of beetles. This was attributed to small-scale architectural differences between species of fine and tussock grasses, rather than differences in plant composition. Body size distributions of beetles showed distinct similarities between the Countryside Stewardship and tussock margins. A greater abundance of large beetles was found in fine grass margins, although in all cases these body size distributions were attributed to a small number of species or a taxonomically distinct group. All three margin types included beetle species of conservation value. The importance of these results was discussed in the context of the value of these seed mixtures for invertebrate conversation.

Field margins were sown with either tussock grass and forbs, fine grass and forbs or grass only seed mixtures. After an establishment year, field margins were managed using standard sward cuts, scarification, or graminicide application. For predatory beetles, overall density was greatest where tussock grasses were included within the seed mixtures, while the densities of phytophagous beetles were greatest where forbs were present. Unexpectedly, species rarefaction curves suggested that phytophagous beetle species richness was greatest where field margins were established using a grass only seed mixture. The structure of the beetle assemblages, i.e., the relative abundances of individual species, was largely dependent on seed mixture, although margin management also played an important role. The results suggest that field margins established using seed mixtures containing tussock grasses and forbs would be expected to provide the greatest resources for beetles, at least at local scales. However, the use of a single standardised seed mixture for margin establishment would result in a homogenisation of beetle assemblages at a regional scale. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Management of lowland mesotrophic grasslands in north-west Europe often makes use of inorganic fertilizers, high stocking densities and silage-based forage systems to maximize productivity. The impact of these practices has resulted in a simplification of the plant community combined with wide-scale declines in the species richness of grassland invertebrates. We aim to identify how field margin management can be used to promote invertebrate diversity across a suite of functionally diverse taxa (beetles, planthoppers, true bugs, butterflies, bumblebees and spiders). 2. Using an information theoretic approach we identify the impacts of management (cattle grazing, cutting and inorganic fertilizer) and plant community composition (forb species richness, grass species richness and sward architecture) on invertebrate species richness and body size. As many of these management practices are common to grassland systems throughout the world, understanding invertebrate responses to them is important for the maintenance of biodiversity. 3. Sward architecture was identified as the primary factor promoting increased species richness of both predatory and phytophagous trophic levels, as well as being positively correlated with mean body size. In all cases phytophagous invertebrate species richness was positively correlated with measures of plant species richness. 4. The direct effects of management practices appear to be comparatively weak, suggesting that their impacts are indirect and mediated though the continuous measures of plant community structure, such as sward architecture or plant species richness. 5. Synthesis and applications. By partitioning field margins fromthe remainder of the field, economically viable intensive grassland management can be combined with extensive management aimed at promoting native biodiversity. The absence of inorganic fertilizer, combined with a reduction in the intensity of both cutting and grazing regimes, promotes floral species richness and sward architectural complexity. By increasing sward architecture the total biomass of invertebrates also increased (by c. 60%across the range of sward architectural measures seen in this study), increasing food available for higher trophic levels, such as birds and mammals.","2009","2020-10-29 20:17:03","2021-10-19 13:14:36","","920-929","","4","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, hedgerows and other structures can also impede dispersal by flying insects. The current work uses the pollen of Phacelia tanacetifolia in hover fly guts as a marker to assess hover fly movement in farm landscapes. In the United Kingdom and New Zealand, Phacelia pollen was found in the guts of Ephisyrphus balteatus and Metasyrphus corollae (United Kingdom) and Melanostoma fasciatum (New Zealand) at distances up to 200 m from the source, when there were no barriers between the flowers and the traps used to catch the flies. The rate of decline over distance in the proportion of flies containing pollen was similar for the two countries. The extent to which four replicated field boundary types impeded hover fly movement was tested using post-and-wire fences, lines of poplars (Populus spp.) with gaps, dense poplars and controls (no potential barriers). Phacelia was planted on one side of each boundary, and along the centre of the control plots. The relative presence of the pollen in flies on both sides of the barriers showed that both types of poplar boundary restricted the movement of the flies, but the fence had no effect. In a separate experiment, gravid females of M. fasciatum were captured at a greater height on a shade-cloth fence than were non-gravid females and males. The implications of this work include the functioning and persistence of metapopulations and the influence of field boundaries on population recovery of beneficial invertebrates following pesticide-induced mortality. If field boundaries contribute to a temporal asynchrony between pest and natural enemy populations, this needs to be considered along with the well-established roles of boundaries as refugia for, and sources of, beneficial arthropods.","2003","2020-10-29 20:17:04","2021-10-19 13:13:59","","605-611","","","134","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We located 16 plots at intervals of 500 m along the shelterbelt and characterized both horizontal and vertical structure of each plot. Wind speed was measured within each plot and at different distances windward and leeward. We found that wind shelter effects were closely related to stand structure of the studied M. glyptostroboides shelterbelt. Stands with high basal area but intermediate crown index and intermediate proportion of large trees (LT) produced the best shelter effects, with significantly longer shelter distance (d70, shelter distance which the wind speed U does not exceed 70 % of U (0)) and slightly lower minimum relative wind speed (U (m) /U (0)). Simple structural indices that can be easily measured in the field were good predictors of the shelter effect. LT was the best predictor of d70, while basal area at ground level was the best predictor of U (m)/U (0). The relationships between stand structure and shelter effect provides a practical guideline to the design, construction and management of forest shelterbelts. In order to provide the best shelter effects, high basal area of > 50 m(2) ha(-1) at ground level or > 33 m(2) ha(-1) at breast height coupled with an intermediate LT value of about 60 % should be maintained for the studied M. glyptostroboides shelterbelt.","2013","2020-10-29 20:17:04","2021-10-19 13:13:49","","251-257","","","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To augment the density of the predators of aphids weed strips were sown in tramlines and along the border parallel to the first and the last row of trees in one half of the orchard (the other half served as control) in April 1992. Weekly visual observations, monthly beating-tray samples, branch samples in winter, and assessment of the density of spider webs and their trapping efficiency on randomly chosen trees were carried out in 1993. During 1993, significant differences in the number of aphids, aphidophagous insects, and spiders were observed on the apple trees within both the strip-managed area and the control area. The impact on aphids by the aphidophagous insects was important during the flowering time of weeds in spring and summer. In autumn, however, spiders (i.e. Araniella spp.) were the dominant predators of aphids on the trees; during this time of the year they were more abundant within the strip-managed area of the orchard. With a higher density of webs, spiders significantly reduced the number of aphids able to return from their summer host plants. Consequently, less hatching aphids were found on branch samples of the strip-managed area compared to the control area.

The aims of the study were to establish relative roles of food and cover for the vole habitat selection and to determine whether habitat use differed between filter strips (5m) and buffer zones (>15m). Also, seasonal differences in habitat use in these ecosystems were studied. Habitat use was measured in terms of home range size and habitat selection functions based on compositional analysis. Home range sizes tended to be larger and distances moved were longer in narrow than in wide buffer zones during manipulations. Field margin width had a significant impact on the use of available habitats. Habitats with vegetative cover were preferred to other available habitat types, particularly in wide buffer zones. Voles in the filter strips used crop fields and mowed areas significantly more than voles in buffer zones. Home ranges were smallest in winter and largest in autumn.

Large amounts of fines cover the other bed substrate that are essential habitat for invertebrates and fish. In Iowa and other agricultural Midwestern states, riparian conservation land-uses are being established to minimize sediment inputs to streams. This study compared stream bed substrate composition in reaches adjacent to: riparian forest buffers, grass filters, row-cropped fields, pastures with cattle fenced out of the stream and continuous, rotational and intensively grazed rotational pastures, in three regions of Iowa. The objective was to examine the impacts of the adjacent riparian land-uses on stream bed substrate composition. The percentages of fines in this study ranged from: 36 to 63% in the central region; 10 to 31% in the northeast region; and 22 to 85% in the southeast region. The high percentage of fines in most stream bed reaches indicates high embeddedness. The high embeddedness resulted in the few significant differences in substrate percentages among riparian land-uses. Decades of agricultural land-uses have heavily impacted stream beds and only significant reductions in surface and bank erosion at the watershed scale can begin to reverse this trend. There were indications that riparian forest buffers and to a lesser degree, pastures with cattle fenced out of the stream, could decrease fines resulting in a more diverse substrate composition. Overall, more targeted approaches for the establishment of conservation land-uses in combination with other restoration practices (e.g. in-stream enhancements) are required to successfully decrease fines on stream beds.

Streambank erosion can contribute a significant percentage of the phosphorus and sediment load in streams. Riparian land-uses can heavily influence streambank erosion. The objective of this study was to compare streambank erosion along reaches of row-cropped fields, continuous, rotational and intensive rotational grazed pastures, pastures where cattle were fenced out of the stream, grass filters and riparian forest buffers, in three physiographic regions of Iowa. Streambank erosion was measured by surveying the extent of severely eroding banks within each riparian land-use reach and randomly establishing pin plots on subsets of those eroding banks. Based on these measurements, streambank erosion rate, erosion activity, maximum pin plot erosion rate, percentage of streambank length with severely eroding banks, and soil and phosphorus losses per unit length of stream reach were compared among the riparian land-uses. Riparian forest buffers had the lowest streambank erosion rate (15-46 mm/year) and contributed the least soil (5-18 tonne/km/year) and phosphorus (2-6 kg/km/year) to stream channels. Riparian forest buffers were followed by grass filters (erosion rates 41-106 mm/year, soil losses 22-47 tonne/km/year, phosphorus losses 9-14 kg/km/year) and pastures where cattle were fenced out of the stream (erosion rates 22-58 mm/year, soil losses 6-61 tonne/km/year, phosphorus losses 3-34 kg/km/year). The streambank erosion rates for the continuous, rotational, and intensive rotational pastures were 101-171, 104-122, and 94-170 mm/year, respectively. The soil losses for the continuous, rotational, and intensive rotational pastures were 197-264, 94-266, and 124-153 tonne/km/year, respectively, while the phosphorus losses were 71-123, 37-122, and 66 kg/km/year, respectively. The only significant differences for these pasture practices were found among the percentage of severely eroding bank lengths with intensive rotational grazed pastures having the least compared to the continuous and rotational grazed pastures. Row-cropped fields had the highest streambank erosion rates (239 mm/year) and soil losses (304 tonne/km/year) and very high phosphorus losses (108 kg/km/year).

The objective of this study was to investigate the impacts of riparian land management on gully erosion. A field survey documented the number of gullies and cattle access points in riparian forest buffers, grass filters, annual row-cropped fields, pastures in which the cattle were fenced out of the stream, and continuously, rotationally and intensive rotationally grazed pastures in three regions of Iowa. Gully lengths, depths and severely eroding bank areas were measured. Gullies exhibited few significant differences among riparian management practices. The most significant differences were exhibited between conservation and agricultural management practices, an indication that conservation practices could reduce gully erosion. Changes in pasture management from continuous to rotational or intensive rotational grazing showed no reductions in gully erosion. It is important to recognize that more significant differences among riparian management practices were not exhibited because the conservation and alternative grazing practices had recently been established. As gully formation is more impacted by upland than riparian management, gully stabilization might require additional upland conservation practices. The existence of numerous cattle access points in pastures where cattle have full access to the stream also indicates that these could be substantial sources of sediment for streams. Finally, the gully banks were less important sediment contributors to streams than the streambanks. The severely eroding bank areas in streams were six times greater than those in the gullies in the monitored reaches.","2012","2020-10-29 20:17:14","2020-10-29 20:17:14","","1009-1021","","","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exposed erosion pins were measured to estimate stream bank erosion rates, approximately every month from June 1998 to June 1999, except during the winter months. Total stream bank soil losses for each treatment were estimated from the mean bank erosion rate, mean bulk density, and the total stream bank eroding area.

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of prairie filter strips (PFS) in removing nutrients from cropland runoff in 12 small watersheds in central Iowa. Four treatments with PFS of different spatial coverage and distribution (No-PFS, 10% PFS, 10% PFS with strips, and 20% PFS with strips) were arranged in a balanced incomplete block design across four blocks in 2007. A no-tillage two-year corn (Zea mays L.) -soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) rotation was grown in row-cropped areas beginning in 2007. Runoff was monitored by H flumes, and runoff water samples were collected during the growing seasons to determine concentrations of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) through 2011. Overall, the presence of PFS reduced mean annual NO3-N, TN, and TP concentrations by 35%, 73%, and 82%, respectively, and reduced annual NO3-N, TN, and TP losses by 67%, 84%, and 90%, respectively. However, the amount and distribution of PFS had no significant impact on runoff and nutrient yields. The findings suggest that utilization of PFS at the footslope position of annual row crop systems provides an effective approach to reducing nutrient loss in runoff from small agricultural watersheds.","2014","2020-10-29 20:17:17","2021-10-19 13:14:32","","54-64","","","69","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main reason for the lack of success of AES is considered to be their low ecological quality and insufficient area. Understanding the effects of different management strategies on the ecological quality of AES is therefore important. Here, we investigate the relationship between breeding bird density and species richness and the age of sown field margins, a widely used type of AES, in southwestern Switzerland. Territories of breeding birds were mapped on 67 field margins between 2004 and 2011. Territory densities (for eight species) and species richness were analysed in relation to age of the field margin. A general negative correlation between size of the field margin and territory density indicated that territory density was higher when the birds could forage in adjacent cultivated land. Territory densities and species richness increased up to an age of 4-6years after sowing, depending on the species, and declined thereafter. The results suggest that the co-occurrence of newly sown margins and margins over 3years old will have a positive effect on breeding bird densities and species diversity.","2013","2020-10-29 20:17:17","2020-10-29 20:17:17","","779-791","","","155","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Semi-natural vegetation and diverse cropping systems have been converted into monocultures with low tree densities, leaving the soil unprotected. We evaluated the association in soil-and water-conservation systems with production in traditional almond orchards and the beneficial impact of plant strips in mountainous agriculture. Soil loss, runoff and nutrient loss over a four-year period (2002-2005) were monitored in hillside erosion plots with almond trees under different soil-management systems: (1) non-tillage with sage (Salvia lavandulifolia L. subspecies Oxyodon) strips 3 m wide; (2) non-tillage with rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) strips, (3) non-tillage with thyme (Thymus baeticus L. Boiss. exlacaita) strips, and (4) conventional tillage on the south flank of the Sierra Nevada (Lanjaron) in south-eastern Spain. Also, the nut yield from almond trees, and the biomass from aromatic-shrub strips were measured. The erosion plots, located on a 35% slope, were 144 m(2) in area. The plant-cover strips, 3 m wide, ran across the slope. Our results show that the most effective treatment proved to be non-tillage with thyme strips, reducing the annual soil loss by 93% and runoff by 80%, with respect to conventional tillage. Non-tillage with rosemary strips reduced soil loss by 91% and runo. by 82%, with respect to conventional tillage, while these percentages were 69% and 51%, respectively, for non-tillage with sage strips. In addition, all the treatments as a whole, in comparison with conventional tillage, revealed that the plant strips were the decisive factor in the reduction of NPK losses by surface runoff. The average nut yield from non-tillage with sage strips, non-tillage with rosemary strips, non-tillage with thyme strips and conventional tillage during the study period was 2.4, 3.2, 3.8 and 4.5 kg tree(-1), respectively, and the essential oil yield from sage, rosemary and thyme strips was 5.0, 8.7 and 10.8 L ha(-1), respectively. The non-tillage with thyme strips decreased nutrient loading in surface waters and thus had a positive impact on the environment while simultaneously maintaining reasonable almond-production levels. Thus, the combination of orchard trees with shrubs provided a viable option to conserve soil and water in hilly areas with opportunities to increase overall land productivity as well as sustainable agro-environmental measures.","2008","2020-10-29 20:17:18","2020-10-29 20:17:18","","497-505","","","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vegetation is believed to increase water infiltration and decrease water turbulence thus enhancing sediment deposition within filter media. In the study reported here, field experiments have been conducted to examine the efficiency of vegetated filter strips for sediment removal from cropland runoff. Twenty filters with varying length, slope and vegetated cover were used under simulated runoff conditions with an average sediment concentration of 2700 mg/L. The filters were 2, 5, 10 and 15 m long with a slope of 2.3 and 5% and three types of vegetation. Three other strips with bare soil were used as a control. The experimental results showed that the average sediment trapping efficiency of all filters was 84% and ranging from 68% in a 2-m filter to as high as 98% in a 15-m long filter compared with only 25% for the control. The length of filter has been found to be the predominant factor affecting sediment deposition in VFS up to 10 m. Increasing filter length to 15 m did not improve sediment trapping efficiency under the present experimental conditions. The rate of incoming flow and vegetation cover percentage has a secondary effect on sediment deposition in VFS.
