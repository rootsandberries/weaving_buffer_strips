THE OBJECTIVE OF OUR STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE OF FOREST SPECIES AND TOTAL FOREST SPECIES RICHNESS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE HEDGEROWS, AND TO RELATE THESE PATTERNS OF OCCURRENCE TO THE SPECIES’ HABITAT REQUIREMENTS AND LIFE HISTORY TRAITS. WE SURVEYED IN TOTAL 130 FOREST-HEDGEROW TRANSECTS IN NORTH-WESTERN GERMANY, INCLUDING THREE AGE CLASSES. ABOUT 77% OF ALL FOREST PLANT SPECIES (INCLUDING SOME ENDANGERED TAXA) OCCURRING IN THE NEIGHBOURING FORESTS WERE ALSO FOUND IN THE ADJACENT HEDGEROWS. IN ALL AGE CLASSES, THERE WAS A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DISTANCE FROM THE FOREST-HEDGEROW ECOTONE AND THE NUMBER OF SPECIES. ANCIENT HEDGEROWS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SPECIES-RICH THAN MORE RECENT ONES. WITHIN 100 M DISTANCE FROM THE FOREST EDGE, FOREST SPECIES RICHNESS INCREASED WITH AN INCREASING NUMBER OF SPECIES IN THE NEARBY FOREST AND WITH AN INCREASING COVER OF THE TREE CANOPY AS WELL AS A DECREASING COVER OF THE SHRUB LAYER. SPECIES WITH HIGH FREQUENCY HAD COMPARATIVELY HIGH ELLENBERG INDICATOR VALUES FOR LIGHT, AND WERE MOSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH ANEMOCHOROUS AND EPIZOOCHOROUS SEED DISPERSAL. THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE IN HEDGEROWS OF SPECIES WITH COMMON ATTRIBUTES WAS PARTLY IN AGREEMENT, PARTLY IN DISAGREEMENT WITH THE RESULTS OBTAINED IN PREVIOUS STUDIES. WE CONCLUDE THAT PATTERNS ARE DIFFICULT TO GENERALIZE, PROBABLY DUE TO A STRONG REGIONAL VARIATION IN THE POOL OF FOREST SPECIES AND IN THE SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTS OF BOTH FORESTS AND HEDGEROWS.","142","11","2522","2530","OLD-GROWTH FOREST; ENDANGERED SPECIES; SEED DISPERSAL; HABITAT; GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY; ECOLOGY; ECOTONE; GEOGRAPHY; WILDLIFE CORRIDOR; SPECIES RICHNESS; AGROFORESTRY","","","","","https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/766751 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320709002456 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320709002456 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103079005","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.BIOCON.2009.05.023","","10.1016/j.biocon.2009.05.023","2043999265","","0","001-555-373-960-238; 002-874-438-870-319; 007-221-361-423-978; 007-513-938-529-086; 011-749-588-004-356; 011-817-622-257-771; 015-976-025-076-335; 016-933-839-104-514; 018-300-493-662-705; 019-678-192-960-072; 021-907-377-633-412; 022-609-146-511-814; 024-608-779-166-000; 025-489-289-663-693; 026-524-247-263-808; 026-926-325-058-247; 028-714-759-335-852; 030-388-440-825-295; 030-977-663-351-619; 031-712-522-366-166; 035-857-688-042-308; 038-361-105-216-688; 039-524-631-746-697; 042-092-928-204-292; 042-530-992-835-782; 043-455-371-359-823; 046-559-721-405-224; 047-949-455-932-004; 051-197-969-663-775; 055-312-937-071-683; 056-853-001-254-085; 058-767-657-165-968; 058-965-130-329-871; 062-830-758-105-650; 063-207-503-700-767; 068-061-324-831-836; 068-143-605-669-192; 069-222-611-667-46X; 071-601-864-758-089; 075-235-467-560-472; 083-176-278-282-728; 084-101-049-675-878; 084-744-111-694-770; 086-838-473-034-93X; 087-489-927-388-278; 091-812-760-612-259; 096-835-160-953-686; 098-520-454-909-513; 117-998-580-560-965; 149-673-684-724-149; 154-750-119-428-838; 162-928-341-514-548; 165-123-901-414-731; 168-592-107-353-063; 174-706-848-200-347","66","STEPHAN WEHLING; MARTIN DIEKMANN","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","","LENS",0,"WEHLING S, 2009, BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","WEHLING S, 2009, BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION"

AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION HAS LED TO REDUCED HABITAT QUALITY FOR MEADOW BIRDS. AS A CONSEQUENCE, REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS HAS DECLINED. ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVERS OF THIS DECLINE IN REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IS REDUCED FOOD AVAILABILITY FOR MEADOW BIRD CHICKS. AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES (AES), DESIGNED TO HALT THIS DECLINE, HAVE SO FAR BEEN INSUFFICIENT. MOST OF THESE AES FOCUS ON ENTIRE FIELDS, BUT RECENT RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT DIFFERENCES IN SUITABILITY EXIST WITHIN FIELDS. GRASS FIELD MARGINS MAY BE MORE SUITABLE FOR MEADOW BIRD CHICKS THAN THE CENTER OF INTENSIVELY MANAGED GRASS LANDS. TO IMPROVE EXISTING MEADOW BIRD AES IT COULD BE BENEFICIAL TO IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL MANAGEMENT IN FIELD MARGINS OF INTENSIVELY MANAGED GRASS FIELDS. AN ALREADY EXISTING TYPE OF FIELD MARGIN AES WITH ADDITIONAL MANAGEMENT IS THE BOTANICAL FIELD MARGIN. HERE, WE EVALUATE FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF FIELD MARGIN MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING BOTANICAL FIELD MARGINS, FOCUSING ON AERIAL INSECTS (AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE DIET OF BLACK-TAILED GODWIT CHICKS AND REDSHANK CHICKS) IN FIELD CENTERS AND MARGINS. GRASS FIELD MARGINS CONTAINED MORE LARGE AERIAL INSECTS THAN FIELD CENTERS AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, ADDITIONAL MANAGEMENT OF THE GRASS FIELD MARGIN INCREASED THE NUMBER OF AERIAL INSECTS IN THE MARGIN. WE CONCLUDE THAT COMBINING MEADOW BIRD AES AND BOTANICAL FIELD MARGIN MANAGEMENT MAY ENHANCE MEADOW BIRD FOOD AVAILABILITY AND IMPROVE THE EFFICACY OF AES.","29","","45","50","REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; HABITAT; GEOGRAPHY; WADER; GODWIT; BIRD FOOD; LIMOSA LIMOSA; FOOD AVAILABILITY; AGROFORESTRY; MARGIN (MACHINE LEARNING)","","","","FOUNDATION CHAIR IN NATURE CONSERVATION","https://research.wur.nl/en/publications/effects-of-grass-field-margin-management-on-food-availability-for https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/497287 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1617138115300297 http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/497287","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.JNC.2015.11.001","","10.1016/j.jnc.2015.11.001","2101971495","","0","003-251-732-418-644; 018-028-975-115-624; 020-024-935-817-641; 021-442-834-836-016; 027-333-326-912-540; 028-569-103-182-314; 031-592-787-048-258; 031-679-436-165-884; 042-034-608-348-187; 044-307-871-990-779; 044-351-103-625-865; 046-513-869-126-279; 052-650-761-479-783; 057-565-952-334-216; 073-540-748-355-529; 081-198-292-463-95X; 084-849-435-270-203; 095-014-169-963-827; 105-356-143-975-089; 107-878-351-423-917; 124-193-767-897-678; 169-564-291-066-782; 183-583-843-591-800","3","J.M.R.

WE MANIPULATED PLANT DIVERSITY (2, 6, 12 OR 20 SOWN SPECIES) IN 9 WILDFLOWER STRIPS IN A REGION OF INTENSIVE FARMLAND. TO IDENTIFY THE MAJOR FACTORS REGULATING THE DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF A. BRUENNICHI, WE QUANTIFIED THREE CHARACTERISTICS OF VEGETATION (SPECIES DIVERSITY, COMPOSITION AND VEGETATION STRUCTURE) AS WELL AS THE SPIDER'S PREY COMMUNITY AND NATURAL ENEMIES. THE DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF A. BRUENNICHI WAS REGULATED BY COMBINED BOTTOM-UP AND TOP-DOWN PROCESSES AS WELL AS BY DIRECT AND INDIRECT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TROPHIC LEVELS. FOUR MAIN FACTORS WERE IDENTIFIED: (1) THE STRONG DIRECT EFFECT OF VEGETATION STRUCTURE, (2) THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF PLANT SPECIES DIVERSITY, WHICH AFFECTED SPIDER ABUNDANCE DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY THROUGH INCREASED DENSITIES AND SIZE OF FLOWER-VISITING PREY SPECIES, (3) THE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE DIRECT EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PLANT SPECIES, AND (4) THE STRONGLY NEGATIVE DIRECT EFFECT OF PREDACIOUS HORNETS. THE ADVANTAGE OF TAKING A GLOBAL APPROACH TO UNDERSTAND THE REGULATION OF SPECIES ABUNDANCE IS HIGHLIGHTED FIRST BY THE QUANTIFICATION OF THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF FACTORS, WITH A SURPRISINGLY STRONG EFFECT OF HORNET PREDATORS, AND SECOND BY THE DISCOVERY OF A DIRECT EFFECT OF PLANT DIVERSITY, WHICH RAISES INTRIGUING QUESTIONS ABOUT HABITAT SELECTION BY THIS SPIDER.","13","8","706","714","RELATIVE SPECIES ABUNDANCE; HABITAT; PREDATION; ECOLOGY; ARGIOPE BRUENNICHI; SPIDER; SPECIES DIVERSITY; TROPHIC LEVEL; ABUNDANCE (ECOLOGY); BIOLOGY","","","","","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179112001296 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179112001296 http://doc.rero.ch/record/211444 https://www.unifr.ch/biology/assets/files/bersier/basic_and_applied_ecology_bruggisser_2012.pdf https://doc.rero.ch/record/211444/files/Bruggisser_O._-_Direct_and_indirect_bottom-up.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.BAAE.2012.10.001","","10.1016/j.baae.2012.10.001","2012774580","","0","007-395-328-016-385; 008-436-951-507-439; 010-225-312-935-498; 011-839-569-702-22X; 013-994-533-427-425; 015-322-386-681-933; 015-790-636-586-427; 017-402-843-993-223; 018-645-414-730-196; 019-140-602-318-134; 021-854-472-647-242; 022-321-534-473-933; 023-888-326-247-353; 027-483-858-126-86X; 029-264-077-202-287; 029-324-991-196-140; 039-112-596-230-618; 040-524-368-527-862; 043-065-405-983-357; 061-779-015-538-909; 063-141-893-182-571; 063-593-316-301-291; 067-655-240-305-558; 069-559-278-898-558; 071-350-691-756-400; 074-657-096-997-491; 077-841-358-017-983; 078-139-286-626-064; 080-946-104-061-684; 081-930-520-530-902; 084-893-330-370-820; 088-710-088-449-565; 090-637-596-119-953; 092-914-880-817-287; 093-389-302-172-409; 093-525-655-948-608; 096-717-963-459-246; 098-939-648-476-800; 108-401-586-520-488; 108-710-073-825-242; 111-148-023-468-083; 119-930-944-113-608; 121-366-382-050-525; 121-954-134-376-260; 133-014-970-838-788; 133-068-333-483-834; 134-625-227-874-781; 136-375-850-103-819; 139-731-348-028-080; 145-523-815-049-35X; 163-360-463-534-464; 163-548-412-049-287; 167-939-813-452-150; 176-487-968-801-222; 180-906-692-394-694; 181-030-964-660-195; 192-154-598-835-242; 195-723-801-643-50X","14","ODILE T.

INVERTEBRATES WERE MOST ABUNDANT IN HEDGEROWS AND ADJACENT VEGETATION DURING THE SUMMER WHEN THE DIET OF THE DUNNOCK WAS LARGELY INSECTIVOROUS. BEETLES (COLEOPTERA) WERE THE MAIN TAXA IN THE DIET, WITH WEEVILS (CURCULIONIDAE) AND ROVE BEETLES (STAPHYLINIDAE) PREDOMINATING. ARACHNIDS WERE IMPORTANT, AND SNAILS (GASTROPODA), EARTHWORMS (OLIGOCHAETA), SPRINGTAILS (COLLEMBOLA) AND FLIES (DIPTERA) WERE TAKEN. SEEDS WERE AVAILABLE IN THE STUDY AREA FROM JULY AND FEATURED IN THE DIET FROM AUGUST TO APRIL. NETTLE URTICA DIOICA COMPRISED THE MAIN SEED IN THE DIET. OTHER IMPORTANT SEEDS INCLUDED YORKSHIRE FOG HOLCUS LANATUS, ELDER SAMBUCUS NIGRA AND DOCK RUMEX OBTUSIFOLIUS. STOMACH STONES WERE MOST COMMON IN THE FAECES IN WINTER. THE DUNNOCKS WERE PREDOMINANTLY GROUND FEEDERS AND MAINLY USED A HOP-PICKING TECHNIQUE. SOME SEEDS AND INVERTEBRATES WERE PICKED DIRECTLY OFF PLANTS BY DUNNOCKS ABOVE THE GROUND. MOST FEEDING OCCURRED IN HEDGEROWS, WHICH FORMED A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE STUDY AREA. OVERGROWN HEDGEROWS WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE FIVE HEDGEROW TYPES. NETTLE PATCHES WERE AN IMPORTANT FEEDING HABITAT. DUNNOCKS USUALLY FORAGED ALONE OR IN PAIRS AND RARELY FED IN ASSOCIATION WITH OTHER BIRD SPECIES. THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF TIME SPENT FEEDING WAS IN JANUARY AND THE LOWEST IN MAY.","128","4","526","539","FORAGING; INSECTIVORE; ECOLOGY; HOLCUS LANATUS; CURCULIONIDAE; URTICA DIOICA; POPULATION; PRUNELLA MODULARIS; RUMEX OBTUSIFOLIUS; BIOLOGY; ZOOLOGY","","","","","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1986.tb02704.x","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1474-919X.1986.TB02704.X","","10.1111/j.1474-919x.1986.tb02704.x","2093088108","","0","000-074-703-336-072; 012-971-863-971-417; 035-550-025-968-242; 053-414-993-110-135; 055-382-436-734-462; 056-184-678-011-696; 066-686-020-101-006; 078-878-989-569-683; 090-614-628-535-723; 105-140-027-461-360; 116-353-622-420-49X; 116-943-410-906-340; 122-612-529-467-534; 123-101-393-754-826","11","GLENN BISHTON","IBIS","IBIS","","LENS",0,"BISHTON G, 2008, IBIS","BISHTON G, 2008, IBIS"

OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF THESE LAND USES ON THE ACTIVITIES OF SELECTED ENZYMES (Β-GLUCOSIDASE, Β-GLUCOSAMINIDASE, FLUORESCEIN DIACETATE (FDA) HYDROLASE, AND DEHYDROGENASE), PROPORTION OF WATER STABLE AGGREGATES (WSA), SOIL ORGANIC CARBON AND TOTAL NITROGEN CONTENT. FOUR MANAGEMENT TREATMENTS [GRAZED PASTURE (GP), AGROFORESTRY BUFFER (AGB), GRASS BUFFER (GB) AND ROW CROP (RC)] WERE SAMPLED IN 2009 AND 2010 AT TWO DEPTHS (0 TO 10- AND 10 TO 20-CM) AND ANALYZED. MOST OF THE SOIL QUALITY INDICATORS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER UNDER PERENNIAL VEGETATION WHEN COMPARED TO ROW CROP TREATMENTS. ALTHOUGH THERE WERE NUMERICAL VARIATIONS, SOIL QUALITY RESPONSE TRENDS WERE CONSISTENT BETWEEN YEARS. THE Β-GLUCOSAMINIDASE ACTIVITY INCREASED SLIGHTLY FROM 156 TO 177 ΜG PNP G−1 DRY SOIL WHILE Β-GLUCOSIDASE ACTIVITY SLIGHTLY DECREASED FROM 248 TO 237 ΜG PNP G−1 DRY SOIL IN GB TREATMENT DURING 2 YEARS. THE SURFACE (0–10 CM DEPTH) HAD GREATER ENZYME ACTIVITIES AND WSA THAN SUB-SURFACE (10–20 CM) SAMPLES. WSA INCREASED FROM 178 TO 314 G KG−1 IN ROW CROP AREAS WHILE ALL OTHER TREATMENTS HAD SIMILAR VALUES DURING THE 2 YEAR STUDY. THE TREATMENT BY DEPTH INTERACTION WAS SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05) FOR Β-GLUCOSIDASE AND Β-GLUCOSAMINIDASE ENZYMES IN 2009 AND FOR DEHYDROGENASE AND Β-GLUCOSAMINIDASE IN 2010. SOIL ENZYME ACTIVITIES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH SOIL ORGANIC CARBON CONTENT (R ≥ 0.94, P < 0.0001). THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE SOIL ENZYME ACTIVITIES AND MICROBIAL BIOMASS CAN BE ENHANCED BY PERENNIAL VEGETATION AND THUS IMPROVE SEVERAL OTHER SOIL QUALITY PARAMETERS. THESE RESULTS ALSO SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT POSITIVE INTERACTIONS AMONG MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, SOIL BIOTA AND SUBSEQUENT ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY EFFECTS ARE OF GREAT AGRICULTURAL AND ECOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE.","84","2","311","323","BIOMASS (ECOLOGY); VEGETATION; PERENNIAL PLANT; ROW CROP; SOIL QUALITY; SOIL FERTILITY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SOIL CARBON; SOIL BIOLOGY; AGROFORESTRY; AGRONOMY","","","","","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-011-9454-8/fulltext.html http://www.ars.usda.gov/sp2UserFiles/Place/36221500/cswq-0490-paudel.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10457-011-9454-8","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1007/S10457-011-9454-8","","10.1007/s10457-011-9454-8","1972987679","","0","002-275-102-975-34X; 002-548-607-793-892; 004-014-866-004-196; 004-771-960-697-150; 007-085-169-174-98X; 014-026-509-704-03X; 015-620-073-261-95X; 016-725-382-309-766; 019-536-329-533-095; 019-622-915-734-27X; 020-664-461-694-234; 025-336-740-381-256; 028-330-817-487-676; 033-344-612-422-797; 034-441-680-556-894; 035-554-523-628-345; 036-315-734-250-926; 044-214-456-182-827; 044-623-657-378-698; 046-463-182-290-90X; 046-681-813-973-463; 051-822-049-360-617; 054-245-802-372-063; 054-292-788-964-67X; 057-056-582-738-09X; 057-789-741-091-819; 057-798-446-166-229; 060-424-924-399-142; 064-872-788-307-008; 071-939-379-659-990; 072-126-095-270-201; 074-819-529-961-830; 074-864-653-310-392; 078-649-327-618-934; 079-196-971-304-319; 081-347-358-673-391; 083-172-644-867-956; 088-017-310-971-747; 088-271-447-101-666; 089-209-083-090-589; 089-267-416-283-668; 092-804-670-514-23X; 092-941-160-711-170; 094-479-438-844-724; 096-499-726-729-908; 099-009-068-726-661; 100-679-216-297-456; 107-996-158-592-679; 112-334-090-036-542; 113-314-420-599-603; 113-727-868-617-019; 116-759-930-330-613; 121-177-129-261-350; 121-412-431-776-82X; 124-188-654-521-336; 125-329-960-003-484; 129-995-958-647-803; 134-226-832-776-612; 149-633-039-918-024; 152-157-521-163-436; 157-870-228-101-338; 159-237-134-366-844; 161-671-403-526-169; 162-898-029-469-717; 175-268-583-761-593; 177-266-256-238-483; 180-216-355-380-330; 184-904-502-014-395; 185-116-269-568-509; 186-022-406-900-002; 191-359-559-824-869; 194-990-894-755-542; 195-126-483-768-634","37","BODH R.

ODONATES REQUIRE HEALTHY WATERBODIES FOR THEIR LARVAL STAGES AND RESOURCE-RICH TERRESTRIAL LANDSCAPES AS ADULTS. AS SUCH, FARMLAND MANAGEMENT AT BOTH LOCAL AND LARGER LANDSCAPE SCALES MAY BE NEEDED TO REVERSE POPULATION DECLINES. WE SAMPLED ODONATE ADULTS AND EXUVIAE FROM LOWLAND FARMLAND PONDS IN ENGLAND, TO INVESTIGATE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ODONATE SPECIES RICHNESS AND SURROUNDING LAND-USE. THE MORE MOBILE DRAGON- FLIES (ANISOPTERA) WERE INFLUENCED MOST STRONGLY BY LANDSCAPE VARIABLES AT THE LARGEST SCALE (I.E. 1600 M RADIUS), WHILE LESS MOBILE DAMSELFLIES (ZYGOPTERA) WERE AFFECTED BY VARIABLES AT MORE LOCAL SCALES (I.E. 100/400 M RADII). A GREATER NUMBER OF LANDSCAPE VARIABLES AFFECTED EXUVIAL SPECIES RICHNESS COMPARED TO ADULT SPECIES RICHNESS. EXUVIAL SPECIES RICHNESS WAS HIGHER WHEN 2 M WIDE CROSS-COMPLIANCE BUFFER STRIPS AROUND PONDS WERE PRESENT. HOWEVER, NO PONDS IN THE STUDY HAD BUFFER STRIPS THAT WERE ESTAB- LISHED THROUGH ENGLAND'S BASIC AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEME (ENTRY LEVEL SCHEME: ELS) AGREEMENTS, AND WE OBSERVED A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ELS AREA AND EXUVIAL SPECIES RICHNESS. EXUVIAL SPECIES RICHNESS INCREASED WITH THE AMOUNT OF WATER, BUT NOT THE NUMBER OF PONDS, IN THE LANDSCAPE SURROUND- ING A FOCAL POND. THE OBSERVED ODONATE RESPONSES TO LOCAL AND SURROUNDING LAND-USE LEND SUPPORT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEME POLICIES THAT ENCOURAGE LANDSCAPE-SCALE, AS WELL AS LOCAL, SCHEME IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT.

THE INCIDENCE OF EACH SPECIES WAS RECORDED IN 50-M LENGTHS OF HEDGEROW AND VARIOUS ATTRIBUTES OF THESE HEDGEROW SECTIONS WERE ALSO RECORDED. 2. LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS WERE FITTED TO THE DATA TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECTS ON THE INCIDENCE OF 18 BIRD SPECIES OF THE NUMBER OF TREES, HEDGE HEIGHT AND WIDTH, DOMINANT PLANT SPECIES IN THE WOODY HEDGE, UNDER THE HEDGE AND ADJACENT TO THE HEDGE IN THE UNCULTIVATED STRIP, THE NUMBER OF WOODY SPECIES IN A STANDARD LENGTH AND OTHER HEDGEROW CHARACTERISTICS. THE EFFECTS OF ADJACENT LAND USE AND CROPPING, REDUCED USE OF PESTICIDES ON CEREAL FIELD EDGES AND THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF THE STUDY FARMS WERE ALSO INCLUDED IN THE MODELS. 3. MOST BIRD SPECIES PREFERRED TALL HEDGES WITH MANY TREES, BUT THERE WERE SOME (DUNNOCK, WILLOW WARBLER AND LESSER WHITETHROAT) WHICH PREFERRED TALL HEDGES WITH FEW TREES AND OTHERS (WHITETHROAT, LINNET, YELLOWHAMMER) WHICH PREFERRED SHORT HEDGES WITH FEW TREES. 4. THE DIFFERENCES AMONG BIRD SPECIES IN RESPONSE TO A SEVENFOLD REDUCTION IN THE HEIGHT OF HEDGES ESTIMATED FROM THE MODELS SHOWED GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE VARIATION AMONG SPECIES IN THE EFFECTS OF SEVERE HEDGE CUTTING ON BIRD POPULATIONS AT ONE FARM OBSERVED IN AN INDEPENDENT STUDY. 5. THE INCIDENCE OF SIX BIRD SPECIES WAS POSITIVELY INFLUENCED BY THE NUMBER OF WOODY SPECIES IN A STANDARD LENGTH OF HEDGEROW. 6. THE INCIDENCE OF TWO BIRD SPECIES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE IDENTITY OF THE DOMINANT WOODY PLANT SPECIES IN THE HEDGE AND ONE SPECIES BY THE IDENTITY OF THE DOMINANT PLANT SPECIES AT THE BASE OF THE HEDGE. 7. LAND USE ADJACENT TO THE HEDGEROW, CATEGORIZED AS GRASS, TILLAGE AND ROADSIDE, HAD A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE INCIDENCE OF FIVE SPECIES. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF CONSISTENCY AMONG SPECIES IN THE DIRECTION OF EFFECTS. 8. THE CROPS GROWN ON TILLED LAND ADJACENT TO THE HEDGEROW HAD A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE INCIDENCE OF THE BLACKBIRD. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF CONSISTENCY AMONG BIRD SPECIES IN THE RANKING OF CROPS, WITH OIL-SEED RAPE THE MOST PREFERRED AND SPRING-SOWN CEREAL THE LEAST PREFERRED. 9.

THE UK GOVERNMENT'S PUBLIC SERVICE AGREEMENT TARGET SEEKS TO REVERSE THE DECLINE OF FARMLAND BIRDS IN ENGLAND BY 2020 THROUGH THE USE OF AES. THE ENTRY LEVEL STEWARDSHIP (ELS) SCHEME, INTRODUCED IN 2005, IS THE FIRST NON-COMPETITIVE, BROAD-UPTAKE STEWARDSHIP SCHEME DESIGNED TO DELIVER SIMPLE BUT EFFECTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT ON FARMS THROUGHOUT ENGLAND. APPROXIMATELY 5 MILLION HECTARES OF FARMLAND ARE CURRENTLY ENTERED INTO ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP (ES) AGREEMENTS, AND GIVEN THE SCALE OF THIS INVESTMENT IT IS IMPORTANT TO VERIFY THE EFFICACY OF ELS AS A MECHANISM FOR DELIVERING BIODIVERSITY BENEFITS. WE USED SPATIALLY REFERENCED ES AGREEMENT DATA TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT OPTIONS AND COMBINATIONS OF OPTIONS ON FARMLAND BIRD POPULATION CHANGES BETWEEN 2005 AND 2008 DERIVED FROM STANDARDIZED SURVEYS CARRIED OUT ON OVER 2000 LOWLAND FARMLAND 1-KM SQUARES IN ENGLAND. THE RESULTS SHOWED ONLY LIMITED EVIDENCE FOR SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF ES. ONLY CORN BUNTING EMBERIZA CALANDRA AND COMMON STARLING STURNUS VULGARIS SHOWED SOME LANDSCAPE-SPECIFIC POSITIVE ASSOCIATIONS WITH AREA UNDER ELS MANAGEMENT. THERE WAS ALSO LIMITED EVIDENCE FOR POSITIVE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT OPTIONS AND THE POPULATION CHANGES OF THE SPECIES AT WHICH THEY WERE AIMED. THE CURRENT PATTERN OF OPTION UPTAKE MAY BE LIMITING BENEFITS OF ELS, WITH BOUNDARY MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 50% OF SCHEME COMPENSATION VALUE. HOWEVER, THE TIME REQUIRED FOR OPTION MATURATION AND THE TIME LAGS IN BIRD POPULATION RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE MEAN THAT IT IS TOO EARLY TO REACH DEFINITIVE CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF THE SCHEME. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY WILL ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELS BY FEEDING INTO THE 5-YEAR REVIEW SCHEDULED FOR 2010 AND HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SIMILAR SCHEMES ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE.","152","3","459","474","ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; GEOGRAPHY; EMBERIZA; CORN BUNTING; STEWARDSHIP; STURNUS; ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP; POPULATION; AGRICULTURAL LAND; ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION; LAND MANAGEMENT","","","","","https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/2259885 https://iris.unito.it/handle/2318/133701 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Catherine_Tayleur_nee_Davey/publication/229934346_Assessing_the_impact_of_Entry_Level_Stewardship_on_lowland_farmland_birds_in_England/links/00b495284cdbbb3667000000.pdf https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2009.01001.x https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2009.01001.x http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2009.01001.x https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103218329 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2009.01001.x/full","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1474-919X.2009.01001.X","","10.1111/j.1474-919x.2009.01001.x","1585012093","","0","000-366-637-240-527; 000-578-113-641-64X; 002-989-142-190-816; 003-223-037-571-948; 003-460-280-575-85X; 007-194-033-627-161; 007-416-181-403-689; 008-225-619-668-580; 008-463-177-472-452; 010-193-015-913-598; 011-984-573-942-606; 013-709-724-948-295; 014-204-563-886-62X; 014-229-118-471-777; 016-421-756-148-512; 018-028-975-115-624; 021-419-559-384-303; 034-780-355-852-32X; 036-395-833-664-537; 041-704-628-510-931; 043-009-269-441-396; 044-616-246-113-964; 049-557-478-030-177; 049-771-162-087-705; 049-945-615-645-704; 050-261-844-716-21X; 051-685-596-945-405; 052-363-993-930-092; 054-715-078-148-813; 056-099-523-856-735; 058-162-964-253-229; 058-416-961-649-911; 059-502-071-789-055; 060-114-103-966-089; 070-807-130-928-517; 073-990-815-488-726; 074-225-773-604-407; 075-168-083-087-797; 076-278-055-254-459; 077-537-180-667-797; 101-600-744-145-933; 103-004-360-139-077; 103-964-543-837-837; 107-532-685-702-969; 108-367-697-659-208; 113-799-548-008-970; 120-993-169-075-447; 133-858-248-195-498; 150-260-537-510-335; 153-263-834-766-903; 153-520-297-719-363; 155-691-175-864-748; 156-542-248-199-177; 158-551-951-339-01X; 179-402-327-063-059","114","CATHERINE M.

BEAR CREEK, IS TYPICAL OF MANY STREAMS IN CENTRAL IOWA WHERE THE PRIMARY LAND USE ALONG THE STREAM'S LENGTH IS ROW CROP (CORN AND SOYBEANS) PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE OR INTENSIVE RIPARIAN ZONE GRAZING. THE BEAR CREEK WATERSHED IS LONG (∼ 35 KM), NARROW (3–6 KM), AND DRAINS 7,661 HA OF FARMLAND. THE MSRBS SYSTEM IS A 20 M WIDE FILTER STRIP CONSISTING OF FOUR OR FIVE ROWS OF FAST-GROWING TREES PLANTED CLOSEST TO THE STREAM, THEN TWO SHRUB ROWS, AND FINALLY A 7 M WIDE STRIP OF SWITCHGRASS ESTABLISHED NEXT TO THE AGRICULTURAL FIELDS. THE 1.0 KM LONG SYSTEM, IS LOCATED ON AN OPERATIONAL FARM AND IS LAID OUT IN A SPLIT BLOCK DESIGN ON BOTH SIDES OF BEAR CREEK. AN INTEGRAL PART OF THIS SYSTEM IS A STREAMBANK STABILIZATION SOIL BIOENGINEERING COMPONENT AND A CONSTRUCTED WETLAND TO INTERCEPT NPS POLLUTANTS IN FIELD DRAINAGE TILE WATER FLOW. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY AS A NUTRIENT, PESTICIDE, AND SEDIMENT SINK FOR NPS POLLUTANTS COMING FROM THE UPSLOPE AGRICULTURAL FIELDS. PRIOR TO ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MSRBS SYSTEM, THE RIPARIAN ZONE ALONG BEAR CREEK WAS GRAZED AND ROW CROPPED TO THE STREAM EDGE. SINCE 1990 THERE HAS BEEN DRAMATIC ALTERATION IN THE APPEARANCE AND FUNCTIONING OF THIS RIPARIAN ZONE. AFTER FOUR GROWING SEASONS, THE FAST-GROWING TREE SPECIES (COTTONWOOD, SILVER MAPLE, WILLOW, AND GREEN ASH) RANGE IN HEIGHT FROM 2.4 M TO OVER 5.5 M. MEAN (FOUR-YEAR) BIOMASS PRODUCTION OF SILVER MAPLE WAS 8.4 DRY MG HA−1, MORE THAN TWICE TO SEVEN TIMES THE YIELD FROM OTHER SILVER MAPLE RESEARCH PLOTS IN CENTRAL IOWA. THE SHRUB SPECIES, SELECTED BECAUSE OF DESIRED WILDLIFE BENEFITS, HAVE DONE WELL IN TERMS OF SURVIVAL AND GROWTH WITH NINEBARK, NANNYBERRY VIBURNUM AND NANKING CHERRY DOING THE BEST. THE SWITCHGRASS GRASS HAS DEVELOPED INTO A DENSE STAND THAT EFFECTIVELY STOPS CONCENTRATED FLOW FROM THE AGRICULTURE FIELDS AND ALLOWS FOR INFILTRATION RATES WELL ABOVE THE FIELD RATE. EARLY ROOT BIOMASS DATA INDICATE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ROOTS BELOW THE MSRBS THAN AGRICULTURAL FIELDS. THIS SUGGESTS BETTER SOIL STABILIZATION, ABSORPTION OF INFILTRATED WATER, AND SOIL-ROOT-MICROBE-NPS POLLUTANT INTERACTION CHARACTERISTICS WITHIN THE MSRBS SYSTEM THAN THE CROPPED FIELDS. NITRATE-NITROGEN CONCENTRATIONS IN THE MSRBS NEVER EXCEED 2 MG L−1 WHEREAS THE LEVELS IN THE ADJACENT AGRICULTURAL FIELDS EXCEED 12 MG L−1. THE WATER QUALITY DATA COLLECTED SUGGEST THAT THE MSRBS IS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING NPS POLLUTANTS IN THE VADOSE AND SATURATED ZONE BELOW THE SYSTEM. THE SOIL BIOENGINEERING REVETMENTS HAVE STABILIZED THE STREAMBANK AND MINIMIZED BANK COLLAPSE. INITIAL RESULTS (FROM 4 MONTHS OF OPERATION) FROM THE CONSTRUCTED WETLAND (BUILT IN SUMMER 1994) INDICATE NITRATE-NITROGEN CONCENTRATIONS OF THE TILE INFLOW WATER >15 MG L−1 WHEREAS, THE OUTFLOW WATER HAD A NITRATE-NITROGEN CONCENTRATION OF <3 MG L−1. OVER TIME THIS WETLAND SHOULD BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE IN REMOVING EXCESS NITROGEN MOVING WITH THE TILE FLOW FROM THE AGRICULTURAL FIELDS BECAUSE OF THE ACCUMULATION OF ORGANIC MATTER FROM THE CATTAILS. OVERALL THE MSRBS SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE FUNCTIONING AS EXPECTED. THIS MSRBS SYSTEM OFFERS FARMERS A WAY TO INTERCEPT ERODING SOIL, TRAP AND TRANSFORM NPS POLLUTION, STABILIZE STREAMBANKS, PROVIDE WILDLIFE HABITAT, PRODUCE BIOMASS FOR ON-FARM USE, PRODUCE HIGH-QUALITY HARDWOOD IN THE FUTURE, AND ENHANCE THE AESTHETICS OF THE AGROECOSYSTEM. AS A STREAMSIDE BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP), THE MSRBS SYSTEM COMPLEMENTS UPLAND BMPS AND PROVIDES MANY VALUABLE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC MARKET AND NON-MARKET BENEFITS.","29","3","201","226","RIPARIAN ZONE; RIPARIAN BUFFER; SOIL BIOENGINEERING; FILTER STRIP; EROSION CONTROL; POLLUTANT INTERACTION; SILVER MAPLE; WATER FLOW; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; AGROFORESTRY","","","","","https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19950612959.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00704869 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19950612959","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1007/BF00704869","","10.1007/bf00704869","2012263050","","0","003-533-399-894-449; 015-514-563-181-208; 021-035-599-514-122; 022-216-181-106-913; 029-274-571-592-996; 034-748-846-517-673; 038-659-320-814-260; 040-806-887-128-56X; 041-983-906-982-299; 045-573-628-287-109; 047-315-074-139-26X; 047-760-535-059-699; 051-081-779-139-353; 054-216-221-470-017; 056-518-814-650-546; 065-821-895-518-368; 066-567-733-926-583; 068-103-192-817-030; 079-789-931-625-023; 080-589-148-600-106; 083-258-693-486-102; 087-138-533-405-771; 097-171-172-806-015; 097-972-089-803-438; 100-760-152-620-952; 111-435-647-398-863; 111-564-487-710-889; 141-101-347-131-583; 176-609-653-505-894; 180-028-828-823-122; 190-787-877-708-569","201","RICHARD C.

EIGHTY-SEVEN SPECIES OF BIRDS WERE RECORDED, 14 OF WHICH WERE CLASSIFIED AS BEING HIGHLY IMPORTANT; OMNIVORES AND GRANIVORES WERE PREDOMINANT. SPECIES RICHNESS (S) AND SPECIES DIVERSITY (H') WERE SIMILAR IN SPRING AND SUMMER, BUT WERE LOWER IN AUTUMN AND WINTER. SPECIES EVENNESS (J') SELDOM VARIED AMONG SEASONS, AND NO CONSISTENT PATTERN IN TOTAL INDIVIDUALS OF ALL SPECIES COMBINED (N) OCCURRED OVER SEASONS. SHELTERBELTS WERE SEGREGATED INTO 3 TYPES BASED PRIMARILY ON STABILITY OF S, J', AND N DURING AUTUMN AND WINTER. EXTENT OF PERIMETER AND LENGTH OF SHELTERBELTS WERE ASSOCIATED MORE OFTEN WITH AVIAN VARIABLES THAN WAS AREA OF SHELTERBELTS. DISTANCE TO WOODED AND OLDFIELD HABITATS, DISTANCE TO AND NUMBER OF PROXIMAL BUILDINGS, AND PERCENTAGE OF CROPLANDS AND PASTURES SURROUNDING SHELTERBELTS WERE IMPORTANT TO ASSOCIATED AVIFAUNA. A CONCENTRATION EFFECT OCCURRED IN ISOLATED SHELTERBELTS; THE GREATER THE ISOLATION, THE MORE LIKELY THAT CERTAIN SPECIES WERE ENCOUNTERED IN A SHELTERBELT DUE TO THE PAUCITY OF SIMILAR HABITAT IN THE VICINITY. PICEA, PINUS, POPULUS, ULMUS, ACER, FRAXINUS, AND LONICERA WERE RELATED TO ABUNDANCES OF SEVERAL AVIAN SPECIES. MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE ESTABLISHING SHELTERBELTS THAT ARE >0.6 HA IN AREA AND 8 ROWS IN WIDTH. PROPER SPACING WITHIN AND BETWEEN ROWS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AND A DIVERSITY OF PLANTINGS SHOULD BE USED. MOWING AND CULTIVATION SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED AFTER THE SHELTERBELT BECOMES ESTABLISHED. SNAGS SHOULD BE RETAINED AS NESTING AND FORAGING SITES. CROPLANDS, RATHER THAN PASTURES, SHOULD BE POSITIONED NEAR SHELTERBELTS. NO-TILLAGE OR MINIMUM TILLAGE SYSTEMS, A FEW ROWS OF STANDING CROPS, FOOD PLOTS, AND ARTIFICIAL FEEDERS AT FARM HOMES ARE SUGGESTED. SHELTERBELTS CAN BE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE PROTECTION AND BEAUTY TO THE FARMSTEAD ASWELL AS TO BENEFIT A VARIETY OF FARMLAND AVIFAUNA. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 47(1):85-104 FARMSTEAD SHELTERBELTS ARE MAN-MADE HABITATS CREATED BY PLANTING ROWS OF TREES AND SHRUBS (HEREAFTER ALSO TERMED PLANTINGS) ON THE WINDWARD SIDES OF FARM HOMES AND BUILDINGS. IN INTENSIVELY FARMED REGIONS OF THE MIDWEST, THESE SMALL WOODED ""ISLANDS"" (GENERALLY <1 HA) PROVIDE PROTECTION AGAINST WIND AND DRIFTING SNOW, REDUCE ENERGY AND FEED COSTS, AND AFFORD AESTHETIC BEAUTY TO FARMSTEADS (SMITH AND SCHOLTEN 1980). FURTHER, SHELTERBELTS ARE OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE TO BIRDS AND OTHER WILDLIFE (POPOWSKI 1976, MARTIN 1978). HOWEVER, AS A RESULT OF LARGER FARMS, INCREASED MECHANIZATION, USE OF PIVOT IRRIGATION SYSTEMS, AND OTHER RECENT TRENDS IN THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY, THE AVAILABILITY OF FARMSTEAD SHELTERBELTS AND OTHER PERMANENT WILDLIFE HABITAT IS RESTRICTED (VANCE 1976). FOR EXAMPLE, GRIFFITH (1976) ESTIMATED THAT FARMSTEAD SHELTERBELTS, FIELD WINDBREAKS, AND OTHER WOODED HABITATS COMPRISE <3% OF THE TOTAL AREA IN THE GREAT PLAINS. ASPECTS OF THE ECOLOGY OF AVIFAUNA ASSOCIATED WITH FARMSTEAD SHELTERBELTS HAVE BEEN EXAMINED. ROTZIEN (1963) AND YAHNER (1981) STUDIED WINTER USE OF SHELTERBELTS BY BIRDS. WEISER AND HLAVINKA (1956), MARTIN (1978, 1980), MARTIN AND VOHS (1978), AND CASSEL AND WIEHE (1980) INVESTIGATED BREEDING AND MIGRATORY COMMUNITIES IN THESE HABITATS. AVIAN USE OF VERTICAL STRATA AND PLANTINGS DURING THE ANNUAL CYCLE HAS BEEN DETAILED (YAHNER 1981B). NEST DENSITIES AND NEST-SITE SELECTION ALSO HAVE BEEN EXAMINED (FIELD 1971, MARTIN 1978, YAHNER 1982A).

WE ASSESSED EFFECTS ON ITS ABUNDANCE OF TWO AES OPTIONS, WIDE FIELD MARGINS AND HEDGEROW TREES, USING LIGHT TRAPS AT THE LANDSCAPE-SCALE AND FOR MARK-RELEASE-RECAPTURE AT THE FARM-SCALE. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT ABUNDANCE WOULD BE HIGHEST AT WIDE FIELD MARGINS AND AT HEDGEROW TREES, AND THAT IF HEDGEROW TREES CONFERRED A POSITIVE EFFECT, INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO FOLLOW HEDGEROWS THAN CROSSING EXPOSED FIELDS WHILE ON THE MOVE. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INDIVIDUALS WERE CAPTURED AT SITES WITH A HEDGEROW TREE. NUMBERS WERE ALSO HIGHER AT WIDE MARGINS, BUT THIS WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, AND NO INDIVIDUALS WERE CAUGHT AT FIELD CENTRES. OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT GENERAL OPTIONS WITHIN APPROPRIATELY DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED AES AIMED AT INCREASING OVERALL BIODIVERSITY IN INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO NOT ONLY BENEFIT COMMON, WIDESPREAD HABITAT GENERALISTS, BUT SOME RARE AND MORE ENDANGERED SPECIES AS WELL. P. BOMBYCINA SERVES AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW GENERAL AES OPTIONS, EXISTING AND NOVEL ONES ALIKE, MIGHT CATER FOR THE NEEDS OF RARE AND LOCALISED SPECIES.

THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT THE USDA-ARS RESEARCH STATION NEAR TREYNOR, IA IN A FIELD MANAGED WITH SWITCHGRASS (PANICUM VIRGATUM) HEDGES. THE SOIL WAS CLASSIFIED AS MONONA SILT LOAM (FINE-SILTY, MIXED, SUPERACTIVE, MESIC TYPIC HAPLUDOLLS). THREE POSITIONS WERE SAMPLED: WITHIN THE GRASS HEDGES, WITHIN THE DEPOSITION ZONE 0.5 M UPSLOPE FROM THE GRASS HEDGES, AND WITHIN THE ROW CROP AREA 7 M UPSLOPE FROM THE HEDGES. INTACT SOIL SAMPLES (76 BY 76 MM) WERE TAKEN FROM THE THREE POSITIONS AT FOUR DEPTHS (100-MM INCREMENTS) TO DETERMINE SATURATED SOIL HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY (K SAT ), BULK DENSITY (Ρ B ), AND SOIL WATER RETENTION. THE GRASS HEDGE POSITION HAD SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER (P < 0.05) MACROPOROSITY THAN THE ROW CROP AND DEPOSITION POSITIONS IN THE FIRST TWO DEPTHS AND GREATER THAN THE DEPOSITION POSITION IN THE LAST TWO DEPTHS. THE K SAT WITHIN THE GRASS HEDGE (668 MM H -1 ) WAS SIX TIMES GREATER THAN IN THE ROW CROP POSITION (115 MM H -1 ) AND 18 TIMES GREATER THAN IN THE DEPOSITION POSITION (37 MM H -1 ) FOR THE SURFACE 10 CM. BULK DENSITY AND MACROPOROSITY WERE FOUND TO PROVIDE THE BEST TWO-PARAMETER REGRESSION MODEL FOR PREDICTING THE LOG-TRANSFORMED K SAT (R 2 = 0.68).

DECLINES IN ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS SPP.) IN EUROPE HAVE BEEN LINKED TO AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION AND THE RESULTING LOSS OF SUITABLE FORAGING AND NESTING HABITATS. ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP (ES) IS A NEW SCHEME IN ENGLAND OFFERING THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESTORE HABITATS OF VALUE FOR THESE IMPORTANT POLLINATORS TO AGRICULTURAL LAND. SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION OF THE OPTIONS PRESCRIBED WITHIN THE SCHEME IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT THEIR OBJECTIVES ARE MET AND THAT THE BENEFITS CAN BE REALIZED BY THE FULL BUMBLE BEE SPECIES ASSEMBLAGE. 2. WE COMPARED THE EFFICACY OF DIFFERENT ES OPTIONS FOR FIELD MARGINS ON ARABLE LAND IN ENHANCING THE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF FLOWERING RESOURCES AND FORAGING BUMBLE BEES. OUR STUDY WAS CONDUCTED OVER 3 YEARS USING A MULTISITE EXPERIMENT. 3. OVERALL, UNCROPPED MARGINS SOWN WITH MIXTURES CONTAINING NECTAR AND POLLEN-PRODUCING PLANTS WERE MORE EFFECTIVE IN PROVIDING BUMBLE BEE FORAGE THAN MARGINS SOWN WITH A GRASS MIX, ALLOWED TO REGENERATE NATURALLY OR MANAGED AS CONSERVATION HEADLANDS. 4. A MIXTURE OF AGRICULTURAL LEGUMES ESTABLISHED QUICKLY AND ATTRACTED ON AVERAGE THE HIGHEST TOTAL ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF BUMBLE BEES, INCLUDING THE RARE LONG-TONGUED SPECIES BOMBUS RUDERATUS AND BOMBUS MUSCORUM. HOWEVER, MARKED DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN SPECIES AND SEXES IN THEIR RESPONSES TO FIELD MARGIN MANAGEMENT OVER TIME. 5. A DIVERSE MIXTURE OF NATIVE WILDFLOWERS ATTRACTED MORE OF THE SHORTER-TONGUED BOMBUS SPP. AND PROVIDED GREATER CONTINUITY OF FORAGE RESOURCES, ESPECIALLY EARLY IN THE SEASON. ALLOWING CIRSIUM SPP. TO FLOWER ON SUCH MARGINS ALSO INCREASED THEIR ATTRACTIVENESS TO MALE BUMBLE BEES. 6. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE LEGUME-BASED 'POLLEN AND NECTAR FLOWER MIX', AS PRESCRIBED UNDER ENTRY LEVEL STEWARDSHIP IN ENGLAND, CAN QUICKLY PROVIDE A HIGHLY ATTRACTIVE FORAGE RESOURCE FOR BUMBLE BEES, BUT THAT ISSUES OF SEASONAL FLOWERING PHENOLOGY AND LONGEVITY OF THE MIXTURE NEED TO BE ADDRESSED.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACTS OF RIPARIAN LAND MANAGEMENT ON GULLY EROSION. A FIELD SURVEY DOCUMENTED THE NUMBER OF GULLIES AND CATTLE ACCESS POINTS IN RIPARIAN FOREST BUFFERS, GRASS FILTERS, ANNUAL ROW-CROPPED FIELDS, PASTURES IN WHICH THE CATTLE WERE FENCED OUT OF THE STREAM, AND CONTINUOUSLY, ROTATIONALLY AND INTENSIVE ROTATIONALLY GRAZED PASTURES IN THREE REGIONS OF IOWA. GULLY LENGTHS, DEPTHS AND SEVERELY ERODING BANK AREAS WERE MEASURED. GULLIES EXHIBITED FEW SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG RIPARIAN MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE EXHIBITED BETWEEN CONSERVATION AND AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, AN INDICATION THAT CONSERVATION PRACTICES COULD REDUCE GULLY EROSION. CHANGES IN PASTURE MANAGEMENT FROM CONTINUOUS TO ROTATIONAL OR INTENSIVE ROTATIONAL GRAZING SHOWED NO REDUCTIONS IN GULLY EROSION. IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT MORE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG RIPARIAN MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WERE NOT EXHIBITED BECAUSE THE CONSERVATION AND ALTERNATIVE GRAZING PRACTICES HAD RECENTLY BEEN ESTABLISHED. AS GULLY FORMATION IS MORE IMPACTED BY UPLAND THAN RIPARIAN MANAGEMENT, GULLY STABILIZATION MIGHT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL UPLAND CONSERVATION PRACTICES. THE EXISTENCE OF NUMEROUS CATTLE ACCESS POINTS IN PASTURES WHERE CATTLE HAVE FULL ACCESS TO THE STREAM ALSO INDICATES THAT THESE COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL SOURCES OF SEDIMENT FOR STREAMS. FINALLY, THE GULLY BANKS WERE LESS IMPORTANT SEDIMENT CONTRIBUTORS TO STREAMS THAN THE STREAMBANKS. THE SEVERELY ERODING BANK AREAS IN STREAMS WERE SIX TIMES GREATER THAN THOSE IN THE GULLIES IN THE MONITORED REACHES.","49","5","1009","1021","RIPARIAN ZONE; EROSION; RIPARIAN FOREST; VEGETATION; GRAZING; FOREST MANAGEMENT; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; STREAMS; AGROFORESTRY; LAND MANAGEMENT","","AGRICULTURE/METHODS; ANIMAL HUSBANDRY/METHODS; ANIMALS; CATTLE; CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES/METHODS; ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING; ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION; GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS; HERBIVORY; IOWA; SOIL/STANDARDS; WATER MOVEMENTS","SOIL","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22419397 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00267-012-9830-9 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00267-012-9830-9 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/587041 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012EnMan..49.1009Z/abstract","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1007/S00267-012-9830-9","22419397","10.1007/s00267-012-9830-9","1980625442","","0","007-868-997-910-082; 016-117-860-166-511; 024-094-631-600-899; 029-250-676-239-025; 030-930-616-665-449; 033-106-156-824-421; 033-488-338-717-64X; 037-490-459-803-77X; 038-335-400-539-341; 040-346-920-371-461; 045-814-903-083-739; 049-317-197-739-54X; 051-921-106-618-48X; 075-466-194-820-598; 083-619-701-060-090; 084-230-744-739-432; 091-412-899-539-225; 097-728-085-931-913; 106-730-563-709-055; 107-605-939-075-788; 109-858-282-831-697; 118-507-802-614-015; 132-380-946-851-855; 133-652-315-317-982; 136-648-532-702-104; 141-890-584-919-504; 144-712-509-851-543; 146-619-043-517-661","11","GEORGE N.

THE RESTORATION OF DEGRADED RIPARIAN ZONES TO IMPROVE A RANGE OF FUNCTIONS IS ATTRACTING INCREASING INTEREST, BUT THERE ARE STILL QUESTIONS ABOUT (I) HOW EFFECTIVELY RESTORATION CHANGES RIPARIAN OR CHANNEL CONDITIONS; (II) WHETHER RIPARIAN MANAGEMENT OFFSETS THE EFFECTS OF WIDER CATCHMENT PRESSURES; AND (III) WHETHER THESE EFFECTS CAN BE DETECTED QUANTITATIVELY. 2. A CATCHMENT-SCALE EXPERIMENT WAS USED TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF RIPARIAN RESTORATION ON RIPARIAN AND CHANNEL CONDITIONS IN THE WELSH RIVER WYE. IN A HIERARCHICALLY DESIGNED SURVEY, VARIATIONS IN RIVER HABITAT CHARACTER WERE ASSESSED AMONG TRIBUTARIES WHERE RIPARIAN ZONES WERE RECENTLY MANAGED FOR RESTORATION (N = 9 STREAMS), UNMANAGED CONTROLS (N = 12), INTENSIVELY GRAZED PASTURES (N = 3) AND CONIFEROUS PLANTATION (N = 3). MANAGEMENT BETWEEN 1997 AND 2003, LARGELY INVOLVING COPPICING, WAS DESIGNED TO EXCLUDE GRAZING THROUGH FENCING IN ORDER TO ENABLE VEGETATION DEVELOPMENT WHILE CREATING SALMONID REFUGES. RIVER HABITAT CHARACTER WAS ASSESSED USING THE UK 'RIVER HABITAT SURVEY' (RHS) METHOD, WITH HABITAT VARIATION QUANTIFIED USING PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS. 3. STREAM HABITATS VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG TREATMENT CATEGORIES. STREAMS DRAINING PLANTATION CONIFER HAD 'HARDER' CHANNEL FEATURES, WHILE THOSE DRAINING INTENSIVELY GRAZED PASTURE WERE CHARACTERIZED BY FINER SUBSTRATA AND MORE ACTIVE CHANNELS THAN ELSEWHERE. RIPARIAN MANAGEMENT REDUCED LIVESTOCK TRAMPLING ( = POACHING) AND INCREASED ALGAL COVER RELATIVE TO CONTROLS. COPPICING AND RIPARIAN FENCING SUCCESSFULLY EXCLUDED GRAZING ON BANKS WHILE INCREASING, IN-STREAM VEGETATION COVER, BUT DID NOT AFFECT SUBSTRATA, FLOW-TYPES AND CHANNEL FEATURES. 4.

IN THIS STUDY, WE ANALYZED THE EFFECTS OF WILDFLOWER STRIPS (WFS) AT THE FIELD SCALE AND IN THE LANDSCAPE CONTEXT ON BUTTERFLIES IN A SWISS ARABLE LANDSCAPE. THREE HYPOTHESES WERE TESTED: (1) BUTTERFLY DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE ARE HIGHER IN WFS THAN IN CONVENTIONAL FIELDS; (2) BUTTERFLY DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE ARE ENHANCED BY THE AMOUNT, PROXIMITY AND CONNECTIVITY OF WFS IN THE LANDSCAPE CONTEXT; (3) ADDITIONAL FACTORS INFLUENCE BUTTERFLY DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE ACCORDING TO INDIVIDUAL SITE CONDITIONS AND LANDSCAPE CONTEXT CHARACTERISTICS LINKED TO OTHER LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS. WFS HAD MORE SPECIES AND INDIVIDUALS OF BUTTERFLIES THAN CONVENTIONAL HABITATS. HOWEVER, PROMOTED SPECIES WERE MAINLY GENERALISTS; FEW SPECIALISTS WERE ENHANCED. THE DIVERSITY OF ALL BUTTERFLIES AND OF GENERALISTS INCREASED LINEARLY WITH PERCENT COVER OF WFS, REFLECTING AN EFFECT OF RESTORATION MEASURES DEPENDING ON THE LANDSCAPE CONTEXT. THE INFLUENCE OF PROXIMITY AND CONNECTIVITY OF WFS WERE, HOWEVER, NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE OCCURRENCE OF SPECIALISTS WAS CONDITIONED BY PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS, WHILE THE EFFECT OF WFS FOR OVERALL DIVERSITY WAS AFFECTED BY THE AMOUNT OF GRASSLAND IN THE SURROUNDINGS. WE CONCLUDE THAT TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BIODIVERSITY-ORIENTATED RESTORATION MEASURES, THEIR IMPLEMENTATION SHOULD BE STEERED TOWARD INCREASING THE SHARE OF WFS IN THE LANDSCAPE. HOWEVER, THE COMBINATION OF WFS WITH ADDITIONAL RESTORATION MEASURES MIGHT BE NEEDED TO HALT THE DECLINE OF SPECIALIST SPECIES.","19","4","500","508","BIODIVERSITY; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; BUTTERFLY; CONTEXT (LANGUAGE USE); GENERALIST AND SPECIALIST SPECIES; SPECIES RICHNESS; ABUNDANCE (ECOLOGY); RESTORATION ECOLOGY","","","","","https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2010.00649.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2010.00649.x/full https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2010.00649.x https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01458621 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2010.00649.x/abstract","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1526-100X.2010.00649.X","","10.1111/j.1526-100x.2010.00649.x","2055349214","","0","000-484-826-607-866; 008-291-852-239-016; 008-630-909-317-753; 011-886-495-134-718; 011-919-119-768-782; 012-267-243-122-028; 014-204-563-886-62X; 014-229-118-471-777; 014-958-779-249-778; 016-421-756-148-512; 016-668-772-079-670; 017-786-901-727-296; 018-028-975-115-624; 019-355-665-347-475; 029-681-801-489-918; 031-216-949-664-784; 033-248-413-039-314; 033-591-414-595-185; 037-002-778-558-737; 037-883-795-788-801; 040-449-873-182-757; 045-077-143-858-513; 045-755-184-521-36X; 053-505-331-627-489; 055-518-211-938-261; 056-099-523-856-735; 056-822-231-800-190; 064-663-934-740-977; 066-376-824-715-720; 070-194-102-378-889; 070-582-747-582-275; 073-256-571-154-968; 076-163-499-540-034; 077-063-381-537-524; 081-749-104-701-059; 082-389-624-773-160; 087-779-919-702-867; 088-723-274-295-38X; 097-704-581-760-870; 098-312-271-690-700; 101-226-492-644-199; 105-301-641-863-030; 112-555-338-163-73X; 115-161-489-792-477; 115-507-657-132-984; 133-272-860-021-373; 134-910-223-418-626; 142-624-071-999-929","43","STÉPHANIE AVIRON; FELIX HERZOG; IRIS KLAUS; BEATRICE SCHÜPBACH; PHILIPPE JEANNERET","RESTORATION ECOLOGY","RESTORATION ECOLOGY","","LENS",0,"AVIRON S, 2010, RESTORATION ECOLOGY","AVIRON S, 2010, RESTORATION ECOLOGY"

THIS STUDY CONDUCTED A FIELD SURVEY OF FRUIT ORCHARDS (AVERAGE SLOPE 3.1-12.2%) OF THE LOURENS RIVER CATCHMENT, SOUTH AFRICA, WHICH SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON THE CHARACTERISTICS AND ATTRIBUTES OF BUFFER STRIPS SEPARATING ORCHARD AREAS FROM TRIBUTARY STREAMS. IN ADDITION, IN-STREAM AND EROSION RILL WATER SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED DURING THREE RUNOFF EVENTS AND GIS-BASED MODELING WAS EMPLOYED TO PREDICT LOSSES OF PESTICIDES ASSOCIATED WITH RUNOFF. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT EROSION RILLS ARE COMMON IN BUFFER STRIPS (ON AVERAGE 13 TO 24 M WIDE) OF THE TRIBUTARIES (UP TO 6.5 EROSION RILLS PER KM FLOW LENGTH) AND THAT EROSION RILLS REPRESENT CONCENTRATED ENTRY PATHWAYS OF PESTICIDE RUNOFF INTO THE TRIBUTARIES DURING RAINFALL EVENTS. EXPOSURE MODELING SHOWS THAT MEASURED PESTICIDE SURFACE WATER CONCENTRATIONS CORRELATED SIGNIFICANTLY (R(2)=0.626; P<0.001) WITH RUNOFF LOSSES PREDICTED BY THE MODELING APPROACH IN WHICH BUFFER STRIP WIDTH WAS SET TO ZERO AT SITES WITH EROSION RILLS; IN CONTRAST, NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PREDICTED RUNOFF LOSSES AND IN-STREAM PESTICIDE CONCENTRATIONS WERE DETECTED IN THE MODELING APPROACH THAT NEGLECTED EROSION RILLS AND THUS ASSUMED EFFICIENT BUFFER STRIPS. OVERALL, THE RESULTS OF OUR STUDY SHOW THAT EROSION RILLS MAY SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE BUFFER STRIP PESTICIDE RETENTION EFFICACIES DURING RUNOFF EVENTS AND SUGGEST THAT THE CAPABILITY OF BUFFER STRIPS AS A RISK MITIGATION TOOL FOR RUNOFF IS LARGELY OVERESTIMATED IN CURRENT REGULATORY RISK ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES CONDUCTED FOR PESTICIDE AUTHORIZATION.","545-546","","171","183","","EXPOSURE MODELING; FIELD SURVEY; MONITORING; RISK ASSESSMENT; RUNOFF; SOUTH AFRICA","AGRICULTURE; ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION AND REMEDIATION/METHODS; GEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA; PESTICIDES/ANALYSIS; RIVERS; SOUTH AFRICA; WATER MOVEMENTS; WATER POLLUTANTS, CHEMICAL/ANALYSIS; WATER POLLUTION, CHEMICAL/PREVENTION & CONTROL","PESTICIDES; WATER POLLUTANTS, CHEMICAL","NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION (NRF) OF SOUTH AFRICA; GERMAN FEDERAL MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND RESEARCH (BMBF)","","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.SCITOTENV.2015.12.077","26745303","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.12.077","","","0","001-021-964-543-19X; 001-836-756-599-946; 002-948-953-603-150; 007-558-420-880-022; 011-210-426-196-245; 015-339-877-852-566; 019-057-578-554-139; 021-655-763-861-159; 021-869-493-155-302; 023-593-689-053-656; 026-689-206-139-259; 027-138-332-330-092; 029-942-152-064-76X; 032-809-616-309-952; 035-815-657-151-928; 043-320-672-388-224; 043-589-082-589-562; 046-626-408-470-449; 055-928-057-358-040; 058-541-759-409-044; 068-933-096-514-243; 081-700-836-157-645; 087-680-309-241-290; 092-770-635-340-892; 097-986-438-425-365; 101-087-831-253-364; 111-288-588-656-115; 114-040-630-292-408; 132-101-636-585-761; 138-643-821-809-522; 163-440-025-402-955","12","SEBASTIAN STEHLE; JAMES MICHAEL DABROWSKI; ULI BANGERT; RALF SCHULZ","THE SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","THE SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","EXPOSURE MODELING; FIELD SURVEY; MONITORING; RISK ASSESSMENT; RUNOFF; SOUTH AFRICA","LENS",0,"STEHLE S, 2015, THE SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","STEHLE S, 2015, THE SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT"

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE TIME PERIOD OVER WHICH CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT PRACTICES BEST EXPLAINS THE OCCURRENCE OF 40 PLANT SPECIES NOW COMMONLY FOUND IN 311 FIELD MARGINS OF ZONE ATELIER ARMORIQUE, BRITTANY, FRANCE. FIVE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WERE SURVEYED EVERY YEAR SINCE 1995.

MODEL SELECTION USING AIC CRITERIA ALLOWED US TO IDENTIFY THE TIME PERIOD OVER WHICH TO CONSIDER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT BEST EXPLAIN PLANT PATTERNS. FOR ONE THIRD OF THE COMMON 40 PLANT SPECIES RECORDED, THE TIME PERIOD OVER WHICH TO CONSIDER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WAS GREATER THAN ONE YEAR.

RIPARIAN BUFFERS ESTABLISHED BY THE CREP PROGRAM ARE CONSIDERED TO BE BENEFICIAL TOWARDS THE PROTECTION OF WATER QUALITY. HOWEVER, THE BENEFIT IS BASED UPON ASSUMPTION THAT PLANTED TREES AND SHRUBS SURVIVE AND GROW. LITTLE EVALUATION HAS BEEN DONE WITHIN THE STATE TO DOCUMENT THE SUCCESS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT EFFORTS. WE EVALUATED 63 RIPARIAN PLANTING SITES LOCATED IN THE COASTAL PLAIN, PIEDMONT, AND RIDGE AND VALLEY PHYSIOGRAPHIC PROVINCES OF VIRGINIA. OVERALL, THE RIPARIAN FORESTS IN THE COASTAL PLAIN AND PIEDMONT WERE FULLY STOCKED DUE TO A COMBINATION OF PLANTED AND NATURAL REGENERATION. RIPARIAN FORESTS IN THE RIDGE AND VALLEY REGION WERE INADEQUATELY STOCKED, AND THE REGION HAS PROBLEMS WITH INVASIVE, EXOTIC SPECIES. MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING THE SUCCESS OF FUTURE RIPARIAN RESTORATION AND ESTABLISHMENT EFFORTS ARE TO (1) INCLUDE THE POTENTIAL FOR NATURAL REGENERATION WHEN PLANNING CREP PLANTINGS, (2) STOP MECHANIZED OPERATIONS IN THE RIPARIAN BUFFERS THAT REDUCE PLANTED AND NATURAL REGENERATION (E.G., MOWING AND DISKING), (3) REDUCE HERBIVORY (PARTICULARLY CATTLE) WITHIN THE RIPARIAN BUFFER, AND (4) CONTROL INVASIVE EXOTIC SPECIES AS NECESSARY.","65","2","105","112","RIPARIAN ZONE; RIPARIAN FOREST; INTRODUCED SPECIES; COASTAL PLAIN; HABITAT; RIPARIAN BUFFER; BUFFER ZONE; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; AGROFORESTRY; RESTORATION ECOLOGY","","","","","http://www.jswconline.org/lookup/doi/10.2489/jswc.65.2.105 https://www.jswconline.org/content/65/2/105 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103130233 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103130233.html https://www.jswconline.org/content/65/2/105.full.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.2489/JSWC.65.2.105","","10.2489/jswc.65.2.105","1974889653","","0","015-514-563-181-208; 015-647-658-553-798; 016-096-002-977-908; 019-768-015-132-128; 026-181-938-334-685; 029-294-447-653-235; 044-820-024-059-673; 047-920-434-433-346; 048-236-890-450-284; 048-513-319-982-524; 049-840-251-919-899; 050-710-805-223-931; 059-605-387-511-625; 059-638-521-710-950; 068-997-932-046-194; 070-390-742-240-042; 080-589-148-600-106; 082-797-391-654-568; 082-852-563-985-603; 091-210-464-407-877; 099-499-627-996-022; 111-435-647-398-863; 129-094-553-661-174; 134-191-656-379-548; 141-101-347-131-583; 144-279-645-115-466; 145-082-228-272-951; 147-171-523-241-426; 149-841-348-990-763; 151-096-751-331-332; 164-350-768-837-199","3","B.N.

BIODIVERSITY IS CHARACTERISED AS TOTAL NUMBER OF VASCULAR PLANT SPECIES AND NUMBER OF TARGET PLANT SPECIES AND PRODUCTIVITY AS BIOMASS, ELLENBERG N -VALUE AND GRASS/FORB RATIO. WE ANALYZED THE REPEATED AES RELEVES SAMPLED IN TWO PERIODS, 1993–1995 AND 2000–2003 AND THE DIVERSITY–PRODUCTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS IN SPACE AND OVER TIME. FOR THE ANALYSIS OF THE ROLE OF THE REGIONAL FACTORS, REPEATED AES AND REFERENCE RELEVES WERE COMPARED. NUMBER OF TARGET SPECIES REMAINED STABLE, WHILST THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SPECIES DECREASED, AND THE PRODUCTIVITY INCREASED IN GENERAL IN AES DITCH BANKS. WE FOUND A CLEAR NEGATIVE DIVERSITY–PRODUCTIVITY RELATIONSHIP IN SPACE AND OVER TIME.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF AES DITCH BANKS WAS SIMILAR TO THE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENTS, ALTHOUGH DIFFERENCES TENDED TO BECOME SMALLER IN THE STUDY PERIOD. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE MAIN REASON THAT DITCH BANK AES DO NOT OVERALL SUCCESSFULLY REDUCE PRODUCTIVITY, IS BECAUSE THE AES ALSO RECOMMENDED LATE MOWING AND THAT BECAUSE OF COLONIZATION CONSTRAINTS, THE REGION CANNOT CONTRIBUTE TO A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT.

RIPARIAN BUFFERS REDUCE NONPOINT SOURCE POLLUTION IN AGROECOSYSTEMS BY STORING AND CYCLING NUTRIENTS, STABILIZING STREAMBANKS, INCREASING INFILTRATION, AND STORING WATER. SPECIFIC INFORMATION REGARDING RIPARIAN BUFFER MANAGEMENT IS NEEDED FOR LAND MANAGERS TO MAXIMIZE BUFFER EFFECTIVENESS AT REDUCING AGRICULTURAL CONTAMINANTS IMPAIRING WATER QUALITY. BASELINE SOIL PROPERTIES (TEXTURE, PH, C AND NUTRIENTS) OF THE RIPARIAN BUFFER SURROUNDING A TRIBUTARY OF CANE RUN CREEK IN FAYETTE COUNTY, KY WERE CHARACTERIZED PRIOR TO IMPOSING THREE MOWING REGIMES (INTENSE, MODERATE, AND NO MOW TREATMENTS) AND ONE NATIVE GRASS REGIME. MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE ALONG PARALLEL TRANSECTS LOCATED 2-M AND 8-M DISTANCES FROM THE STREAM. ROOT BIOMASS, AGGREGATE DISTRIBUTION, AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY WERE MEASURED ALONG THE 2-M TRANSECT IN TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS FOLLOWING TREATMENT ESTABLISHMENT. THE 2-M TRANSECT SOILS HAD THE HIGHEST C, PH, CA, ZN, AND SAND CONTENT. THE 8-M TRANSECT HAD THE HIGHEST P, K, MG, AND CLAY CONTENT. SEMIVARIOGRAM ANALYSIS OF C CONTENT INDICATED SLIGHT TO MODERATE SPATIAL DEPENDENCY ALONG THE 2M TRANSECT AND MODERATE TO STRONG SPATIAL DEPENDENCY ALONG THE 8M TRANSECT. ROOT BIOMASS INCREASED WITH DECREASED MOWING FREQUENCY AT THE SURFACE DEPTH AFTER ONE YEAR; THE NATIVE GRASS TREATMENT HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LESS ROOT BIOMASS IN BOTH YEARS COMPARED TO MOWING TREATMENTS. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT TREATMENT EFFECT ON AGGREGATE SIZE DISTRIBUTION AT THE SURFACE DEPTH IN EITHER YEAR. MEAN WEIGHT DIAMETER AND LARGE MACROAGGREGATES DECREASED FROM 2011 TO 2012. VEGETATION TREATMENT HAD NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON WATER STABLE AGGREGATES OR SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY. EXPERIMENTAL SEMIVARIOGRAMS PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF SPATIAL STRUCTURE AT MULTIPLE SCALES IN ROOT BIOMASS, AGGREGATES, AND SOIL C. SPATIAL VARIABILITY OCCURRED OVER A SHORTER LAG DISTANCE IN 2012 THAN 2011, SUGGESTING AN EFFECT OF IMPOSED TREATMENTS SLOWLY DEVELOPING OVER TIME. THIS STUDY PROVIDES IMPORTANT INSIGHTS ON RIPARIAN BUFFER SOIL PROPERTIES, SOIL SAMPLING STRATEGIES TO DETECT SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN RIPARIAN BUFFERS, AND LENGTH OF TIME NEEDED TO ASSESS EFFECTS OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT REGIMES ON RIPARIAN ROOT BIOMASS, SOIL AGGREGATES, AND HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY.","","","","","RIPARIAN ZONE; INFILTRATION (HYDROLOGY); SOIL SCIENCE; SOIL WATER; RIPARIAN BUFFER; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; TRANSECT; SOIL MANAGEMENT; SPATIAL VARIABILITY","","","","","https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&context=pss_etds https://uknowledge.uky.edu/pss_etds/27/","HTTPS://UKNOWLEDGE.UKY.EDU/PSS_ETDS/27/","","","157004022","","0","000-073-950-100-003; 000-175-740-417-165; 002-967-588-995-064; 003-603-625-912-432; 004-749-122-558-927; 004-771-960-697-150; 004-888-973-471-782; 006-550-081-866-468; 009-969-155-123-483; 010-444-920-504-739; 011-084-469-305-195; 011-116-935-334-772; 013-290-771-659-381; 013-358-646-128-264; 013-733-325-784-203; 013-786-600-612-318; 013-872-342-900-78X; 014-026-509-704-03X; 017-640-430-568-126; 018-253-057-463-110; 019-247-155-259-303; 019-443-686-709-770; 019-622-915-734-27X; 020-122-932-561-803; 020-743-403-667-831; 022-499-933-595-637; 024-043-475-626-80X; 025-751-077-629-320; 031-051-143-397-709; 031-859-001-391-928; 032-548-119-922-032; 034-697-909-929-724; 035-093-656-083-327; 035-755-692-140-413; 038-439-180-047-201; 042-078-760-272-222; 042-380-024-265-988; 042-646-115-493-463; 043-159-456-949-965; 048-513-319-982-524; 050-653-235-610-13X; 051-192-674-476-662; 053-270-191-856-939; 055-316-831-627-565; 055-963-378-310-893; 056-578-132-592-582; 057-283-555-498-270; 057-789-741-091-819; 058-186-704-920-650; 062-077-119-226-977; 063-866-301-400-693; 063-913-056-687-369; 064-417-192-270-879; 064-865-041-422-256; 067-887-666-057-021; 068-638-232-359-523; 070-748-151-329-671; 071-017-491-620-470; 073-703-019-282-474; 073-970-910-327-180; 075-177-805-296-166; 083-181-646-900-179; 093-925-899-544-231; 094-542-141-276-251; 095-582-711-973-116; 096-126-707-260-671; 098-594-671-307-115; 100-466-720-517-826; 101-190-301-433-89X; 106-326-670-011-15X; 106-420-178-731-885; 107-490-921-089-850; 109-941-293-087-776; 111-606-443-415-864; 119-010-695-168-082; 124-766-514-685-103; 127-785-284-544-120; 131-436-898-248-747; 148-135-365-025-100; 150-026-188-323-914; 156-501-156-197-472; 159-587-032-641-18X; 160-315-306-101-719; 167-956-786-519-034; 168-270-701-803-491; 174-103-363-317-763; 179-039-702-328-618; 192-939-307-304-522; 193-467-462-074-37X; 196-381-785-440-137","0","AMANDA GUMBERT","","","","LENS",0,"GUMBERT A, 2013, ","GUMBERT A, 2013, "

THE CORN BUNTING EMBERIZA CALANDRA IS CONSIDERED A SUITABLE INDICATOR FOR THE CONSERVATION VALUE OF FARMLAND HABITATS, AND HAS RECENTLY SUFFERED STRONG DECLINES THROUGHOUT MUCH OF ITS EUROPEAN RANGE. AS A BASIS FOR TARGETED CONSERVATION MEASURES, WE INVESTIGATED THE HABITAT PREFERENCES OF THIS SPECIES IN NORTH-EASTERN GERMANY BY COMPARING THE COMPOSITION OF MALE TERRITORIES WITH RANDOMLY CHOSEN CONTROL SITES. A TERRITORY WAS DEFINED AS THE AREA WITHIN A RADIUS OF 150 METERS AROUND THE ASSUMED CENTRE OF THE TERRITORY, AS THE MAJORITY OF NESTS IS FOUND WITHIN THIS RADIUS. TO ASSESS FOOD AVAILABILITY FOR NESTLINGS, ARTHROPOD ABUNDANCE WITHIN THE MOST ABUNDANT LAND USE TYPES I.E. CROP FIELDS, FALLOWS, GRASSLAND AS WELL AS WITHIN UNPLOUGHED STRIPS WAS INVESTIGATED. IN TOTAL WE FOUND 102 MALE CORN BUNTING TERRITORIES, WHICH WERE MAINLY COMPOSED OF CROP FIELDS (50%), GRASSLAND (28%), AND FALLOWS (12%). TERRITORIES COMPARED WITH CONTROL SITES WERE CHARACTERIZED BY A LOWER PROPORTION OF CROP FIELDS, A HIGHER PROPORTION OF FALLOWS, MORE DIVERSE LAND USE TYPES, MORE ABUNDANT FIELD BOUNDARIES, UNPLOUGHED STRIPS, AND TRACKS, AND A HIGHER AVAILABILITY OF SONG POSTS. HOWEVER, NEITHER THE NUMBER OF LARGER (≥ 1 CM), SMALLER ( 10%) AND SONG POSTS (> 70 M 'LINEAR SONG POSTS' OR > 1 SOLITARY POST PER HA) FOR THE HABITAT SELECTION OF MALE CORN BUNTINGS.

IN RECENT DECADES THE BOTANICAL DIVERSITY OF ARABLE FIELD BOUNDARIES HAS DECLINED DRASTICALLY. TO DETERMINE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS RELATED TO THE SPECIES COMPOSITION OF ARABLE FIELD BOUNDARIES, THE VEGETATION COMPOSITION OF 105 HERBACEOUS BOUNDARIES, 1-M WIDE, IN THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN NETHERLANDS WAS SURVEYED. BIOMASS SAMPLES OF THE BOUNDARY WERE TAKEN AT 0-33, 34-66 AND 67-100 CM FROM THE ADJACENT ARABLE FIELD. 2. FARMERS WERE INTERVIEWED WITH RESPECT TO BOUNDARY MANAGEMENT AND LAND USE ON THE ADJACENT ARABLE FIELD. THE TWO DATA SETS CONTAINING THE BOTANICAL DATA AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES WERE LINKED AND ANALYSED BY MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS AND ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE. 3. THE NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS INPUTS TO THE CROP WERE CLOSELY CORRELATED TO ANOTHER ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLE, CROP ROTATION. CROP ROTATIONS DOMINATED BY MAIZE CULTIVATION RECEIVED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NUTRIENT INPUTS THAN THE OTHER ROTATIONS. 4. NITROGEN, PHOSPHORUS AND CROP ROTATION WERE STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOUNDARY VEGETATION. SPECIES RICHNESS OF THE BOUNDARY VEGETATION WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS INPUTS TO THE CROP, WHILE TOTAL BOUNDARY BIOMASS WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO NITROGEN INPUTS ONLY. FURTHERMORE, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTITIONING OF THE BOUNDARY VEGETATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT FUNCTIONAL GROUPS AND BOTH NITROGEN INPUTS AND CROP ROTATION ON THE ADJACENT ARABLE FIELD. NO SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE VEGETATION COMPOSITION AND EITHER HERBICIDE USE IN THE BOUNDARY OR BOUNDARY MANAGEMENT. THIS MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO THE DESCRIPTIVE APPROACH OF THE STUDY: LITTLE VARIATION IN BOUNDARY MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS HERBICIDE USE IN THE BOUNDARY WAS OBSERVED IN THE STUDY AREA. 5. THE BOUNDARY VEGETATION WAS CHARACTERIZED BY A PEAK IN BIOMASS PRODUCTION IN THE ZONE NEAR THE ARABLE FIELD. IN THIS ZONE THE PERENNIAL ARABLE WEED ELYMUS REPENS, AS WELL AS ANNUAL DICOT SPECIES, WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ABUNDANT, WHILE PERENNIAL DICOTS AND MONOCOTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS ABUNDANT COMPARED WITH THE ZONES FURTHER FROM THE ARABLE FIELD. 6. EFFORTS TO PROTECT FIELD BOUNDARY VEGETATION NEED TO FOCUS ON A REDUCTION OR CESSATION OF FERTILIZER APPLICATIONS IN THE OUTER METRE(S) OF CROPS THAT REQUIRE HIGH NUTRIENT INPUTS. THE DETERMINATION OF THE EXACT NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE VEGETATION COMPOSITION OF ARABLE FIELD BOUNDARIES AND THE INTUITIVELY IMPORTANT MANAGEMENT AND HERBICIDE USE IN THE BOUNDARY REQUIRES AN EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH.","37","2","256","266","BIOMASS (ECOLOGY); VEGETATION; CROP ROTATION; FERTILIZER; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; LAND USE; PLANT COMMUNITY; SPECIES RICHNESS; AGRONOMY; ARABLE LAND","","","","","https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00486.x https://www.jstor.org/stable/2655908 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00486.x https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20002303155 http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/64268","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1046/J.1365-2664.2000.00486.X","","10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00486.x","2143599749","","0","009-646-332-019-745; 010-023-731-010-670; 010-289-510-628-686; 011-808-570-962-836; 015-522-490-223-197; 022-994-627-626-27X; 034-200-514-640-583; 039-505-502-984-134; 041-161-807-605-997; 050-532-464-266-167; 056-892-041-411-85X; 060-086-333-706-623; 061-228-767-301-276; 063-003-550-683-547; 065-532-525-025-872; 069-379-822-515-162; 078-966-178-941-701; 082-389-624-773-160; 086-402-015-642-906; 114-480-653-531-829; 122-225-350-278-127; 122-593-714-312-795; 132-380-117-709-640; 143-273-453-722-006; 145-199-506-693-553; 152-877-616-714-726; 167-881-697-695-876; 187-050-769-304-212","171","DAVID KLEIJN; MAREIN VERBEEK","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","","LENS",0,"KLEIJN D, 2000, JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","KLEIJN D, 2000, JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY"

HOWEVER, SUCCESS RATES OF REINTRODUCTIONS ARE LOW DUE TO INHERENT PROBLEMS, SUCH AS BEHAVIOURAL DEFICIENCIES RESULTING IN HIGH POST-RELEASE PREDATION RATES AMONG CAPTIVE-BRED ANIMALS. IN PARTICULAR, THE RELEASED ANIMALS MAY USE HABITATS MALADAPTIVELY, LEADING TO AN ECOLOGICAL TRAP, I.E. PREFERENCE FOR LOW-QUALITY HABITATS LEADING TO REDUCED SURVIVAL AND/OR BREEDING SUCCESS. ECOLOGICAL TRAPS IN REINTRODUCTIONS CAN BE IDENTIFIED ONLY THROUGH INTENSIVE STUDIES OF HABITAT PREFERENCES AND SURVIVAL OF KNOWN INDIVIDUALS, BUT SUCH STUDIES ARE LACKING.; ; 2. WE INVESTIGATED HABITAT PREFERENCES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH SURVIVAL BY RADIO-TRACKING REINTRODUCED, CAPTIVE-BRED GREY PARTRIDGES PERDIX PERDIX, A WIDELY REINTRODUCED COMMERCIAL GAME SPECIES AND NATIVE FARMLAND BIRD OF CONSERVATION CONCERN IN THE UK. THE LOW SUCCESS RATE OF GREY PARTRIDGE RELEASES COULD BE DUE TO MALADAPTIVE HABITAT USE AND A POSSIBLE ECOLOGICAL TRAP.; ; 3. GREY PARTRIDGES RELEASED AS PAIRS IN SPRING SHOWED PREFERENCES FOR CROP AND FIELD MARGIN HABITAT. THE USE OF CROPS HAD A POSITIVE, AND USE OF FIELD MARGINS A NEGATIVE, ASSOCIATION WITH SURVIVAL, SUGGESTING FIELD MARGINS COULD SERVE AS ECOLOGICAL TRAPS FOR RELEASED GREY PARTRIDGES. PREDATION RATES WERE HIGH, AND FIELD MARGINS PROBABLY HOSTED CONCENTRATED PREDATOR ACTIVITY.; ; 4. GREY PARTRIDGES RELEASED AS FAMILY GROUPS (COVEYS) IN AUTUMN EXHIBITED A PREFERENCE FOR GAME COVERS, I.E. AREAS OF TALL VEGETATION SPECIFICALLY PLANTED TO PROVIDE COVER FOR GAME BIRDS, AND MORTALITY RATES WERE LOWER THAN IN SPRING. HABITAT USE DID NOT AFFECT SURVIVAL IN AUTUMN.; ; 5. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT NEWLY RELEASED GREY PARTRIDGE PAIRS BEHAVE MALADAPTIVELY BY PREFERRING A HABITAT WHICH HAS A NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION WITH SURVIVAL. IN GREY PARTRIDGE REINTRODUCTIONS, WE RECOMMEND RELEASING GREY PARTRIDGE FAMILY GROUPS IN AUTUMN RATHER THAN RELEASING PAIRS OF BIRDS IN SPRING, AND PROVIDING GAME COVERS THAT COULD INDUCE THE GROUPS TO SETTLE ONTO THE RELEASE AREAS. IN REINTRODUCTIONS IN GENERAL, THE HABITAT PREFERENCES OF THE RELEASED ANIMALS SHOULD BE DOCUMENTED TOGETHER WITH THEIR FATES, TO ENABLE DETECTION OF POSSIBLE ECOLOGICAL TRAPS THAT COULD THREATEN THE SUCCESS OF THESE CONSERVATION EFFORTS.","47","6","1357","1364","WILDLIFE CONSERVATION; WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; ECOLOGICAL TRAP; PERDIX; GREY PARTRIDGE; WILDLIFE; ANIMAL ECOLOGY; BIOLOGY","","","","","https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01867.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01867.x/full https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01867.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01867.x https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01867.x https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103351791 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103351791.html","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1365-2664.2010.01867.X","","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01867.x","1593695442","","0","011-693-938-201-836; 013-161-341-622-668; 016-080-943-476-05X; 016-646-844-705-347; 020-131-452-110-549; 023-258-160-889-826; 026-656-472-015-127; 031-463-472-944-049; 036-855-574-030-250; 046-221-404-876-286; 046-890-565-150-53X; 047-000-620-546-182; 047-446-378-411-883; 049-280-320-600-396; 049-557-478-030-177; 052-141-425-637-37X; 057-899-802-924-990; 059-431-792-692-469; 062-640-771-728-564; 067-947-244-097-527; 073-344-697-836-016; 074-225-773-604-407; 076-054-234-018-301; 076-278-055-254-459; 083-180-942-841-13X; 085-648-445-233-129; 098-143-627-905-764; 099-193-137-418-404; 106-081-154-740-548; 107-103-881-087-523; 111-720-755-311-457; 111-728-793-696-876; 112-037-725-164-038; 115-851-025-395-201; 143-273-453-722-006; 144-459-648-233-482; 163-081-385-554-379; 172-542-474-113-706; 189-825-034-428-998","33","ELINA M.

GIANT CANE AND FOREST RIPARIAN BUFFER ZONES WERE MONITORED TO DETERMINE EACH COVER TYPE'S ABILITY TO REDUCE GROUND WATER NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS. GROUND WATER WAS SAMPLED AT VARYING DISTANCES FROM THE FIELD EDGE TO DETERMINE AN EFFECTIVE WIDTH FOR MAXIMUM NITRATE ATTENUATION. GROUND WATER SAMPLES WERE ANALYZED FOR NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS AS WELL AS CHLORIDE CONCENTRATIONS, WHICH WERE USED AS A CONSERVATIVE ION TO ASSESS DILUTION OR CONCENTRATION EFFECTS WITHIN THE RIPARIAN ZONE. SIGNIFICANT NITRATE REDUCTIONS OCCURRED IN BOTH THE CANE AND THE FOREST RIPARIAN BUFFER ZONES WITHIN THE FIRST 3.3 M, A RELATIVELY NARROW WIDTH. IN THIS FIRST 3.3 M, THE CANE AND FOREST BUFFER REDUCED GROUND WATER NITRATE LEVELS BY 90 PERCENT AND 61 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY. APPROXIMATELY 40 PERCENT OF THE OBSERVED 99 PERCENT NITRATE REDUCTION OVER THE 10 M CANE BUFFER COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO DILUTION BY UPWELLING GROUND WATER. NEITHER GROUND WATER DILUTION NOR CONCENTRATION WAS OBSERVED IN THE FOREST BUFFER. THE GROUND WATER NITRATE ATTENUATION CAPABILITIES OF THE CANE AND FOREST RIPARIAN ZONES WERE NOT STATISTICALLY DIFFERENT. DURING THE SPRING, BOTH PLANT ASSIMILATION AND DENITRIFICATION WERE PROBABLY IMPORTANT NITRATE LOSS MECHANISMS, WHILE IN THE SUMMER NITRATE WAS MORE LIKELY LOST VIA DENITRIFICATION SINCE THE WATER TABLE DROPPED BELOW THE ROOTING ZONE.","39","2","347","354","RIPARIAN ZONE; LEACHING (AGRICULTURE); NITRATE; ARUNDINARIA GIGANTEA; RIPARIAN BUFFER; BUFFER ZONE; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; WATER TABLE; DENITRIFICATION","","","","","http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003JAWRA..39..347S/abstract http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2003.tb04389.x/full https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2003.tb04389.x https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2003.tb04389.x/full","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1752-1688.2003.TB04389.X","","10.1111/j.1752-1688.2003.tb04389.x","2005044486","","0","000-142-952-017-146; 002-321-610-856-114; 002-509-409-482-215; 005-362-279-630-448; 008-467-759-539-985; 015-514-563-181-208; 019-338-493-505-312; 021-187-528-186-865; 038-659-320-814-260; 046-568-769-714-434; 048-148-537-416-261; 053-093-567-362-36X; 077-354-829-416-449; 080-589-148-600-106; 087-138-533-405-771; 093-184-946-875-581; 100-845-850-323-114; 103-989-366-241-549; 121-468-243-703-60X; 132-186-585-542-192; 136-539-591-611-517; 139-342-966-894-93X; 141-101-347-131-583; 150-539-908-471-485; 164-350-768-837-199; 177-521-755-905-661","63","JON E.

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES WERE PURSUED TO DETERMINE SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS OF THE MICROBIAL POPULATIONS FROM THE INPUT WATER TO A DRAINAGE DITCH, CONVEYING BACK THE FLUX INTO THE RIVER AFTER PASSING THROUGH THE SOIL OF THE WOODED RIPARIAN STRIP. THE BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES WERE DETERMINED BY COMBINED APPROACHES INVOLVING CULTIVATION, MICROSCOPIC METHODS AND DNA BASED TECHNIQUES TO DETERMINE BOTH CULTURABLE AND TOTAL MICROBIAL COMMUNITY IN WATER. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE SIZE OF THE BACTERIAL POPULATION, INCLUDING THE CULTURABLE FRACTION, INCREASES FROM THE RIVER TO THE DRAINAGE DITCH ESPECIALLY ON THE WARM SEASON. THE MULTIPLE APPROACH HERE ADOPTED ENABLED ALSO TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SPECIAL CONDITION CREATED IN THE BUFFER STRIP SUPPORTS THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE METABOLISM OF THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY. THE NATURE OF THE BACTERIAL POPULATION, IN TERMS OF PHYLOTYPES DISTRIBUTION, WAS INVESTIGATED BY 16S RDNA ANALYSIS INDICATING THAT THE MOST REPRESENTED GENERA BELONG TO GAMMA-PROTEOBACTERIA, WHICH IS KNOWN TO INCLUDE AN EXCEEDING NUMBER OF IMPORTANT PATHOGENS. IN SPRING, THE EFFECT OF THE BUFFER STRIP SEEMS TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE SUCH A SUB-POPULATION. THE CHANGES OBSERVED FOR THE TOTAL BACTERIAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION BECOME MUCH EVIDENT IN SUMMER, AS REVEALED BY BOTH DENATURING GRADIENT GEL ELECTROPHORESIS CLUSTER ANALYSIS AND BY THE DIVERSITY INDEX CALCULATION. THE HYDRAULIC MANAGEMENT COUPLED TO THE SUSPENSION OF FARMING PRACTICES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WOODY AND HERBACEOUS VEGETATION RESULTED IN A CONDITION SUITABLE FOR THE CONTAINMENT OF UNDESIRED MICROBIOTA (MAINLY DURING THE SPRING SEASON) WHILE CONTINUING TO SUPPORT DENITRIFICATION ACTIVITY (ESPECIALLY THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER) AS VERIFIED BY THE TOTAL NITROGEN REMOVAL.","9","1","33","37","RIPARIAN ZONE; NUTRIENT; VEGETATION; ECOLOGY; TEMPERATURE GRADIENT GEL ELECTROPHORESIS; DIVERSITY INDEX; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; BUFFER STRIP; DENITRIFICATION; MICROBIAL POPULATION BIOLOGY","","","","","http://core.ac.uk/display/27065858 https://core.ac.uk/display/27065858","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.4081/IJA.2014.548","","10.4081/ija.2014.548","1983131210","","0","001-908-622-487-543; 002-170-315-959-238; 007-260-832-996-388; 020-082-581-265-717; 020-977-235-603-557; 027-978-441-083-205; 049-961-487-037-893; 061-480-972-864-355; 069-613-379-269-86X; 071-367-146-562-193; 079-751-866-864-146; 081-516-085-265-089; 082-480-020-214-656; 084-040-930-198-230; 087-218-177-673-058; 111-685-276-532-817; 118-042-835-886-984; 122-075-844-248-680; 166-338-955-667-560; 177-223-877-096-350","2","MIZANUR MD.

THE RATE OF INFLOW, TYPE OF VEGETATION, AND DENSITY OF VEGETATION COVERAGE HAD SECONDARY INFLUENCES ON P REMOVAL. SHORT FILTERS (2 AND 5 M), WHICH ARE SOMEWHAT EFFECTIVE IN SEDIMENT REMOVAL, ARE MUCH LESS EFFECTIVE IN P REMOVAL. INCREASING THE FILTER LENGTH BEYOND 15 M IS INEFFECTIVE IN ENHANCING SEDIMENT REMOVAL BUT IS EXPECTED TO FURTHER ENHANCE P REMOVAL.

THE MAIN AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO TEST WHETHER ORGANIC FARMING ENHANCES LOCAL PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS IN BOTH CROP AND NON-CROP AREAS OF VINEYARD FARMS LOCATED IN INTENSIVE CONVENTIONAL LANDSCAPES. NINE CONVENTIONAL AND NINE ORGANIC FARMS WERE SELECTED IN AN INTENSIVELY CULTIVATED REGION (I.E. NO GRADIENT IN LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION) IN NORTHERN ITALY. IN EACH FARM, VASCULAR PLANTS WERE SAMPLED IN ONE VINEYARD AND IN TWO NON-CROP LINEAR HABITATS, GRASS STRIPS AND HEDGEROWS, ADJACENT TO VINEYARDS AND THEREFORE POTENTIALLY INFLUENCED BY FARMING. WE USED LINEAR MIXED MODELS TO TEST THE EFFECT OF FARMING, AND SPECIES LONGEVITY (ANNUAL VS. PERENNIAL) SEPARATELY FOR THE THREE HABITAT TYPES. IN OUR INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES ORGANIC FARMING PROMOTED LOCAL PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS IN VINEYARD FIELDS, AND GRASSLAND STRIPS WHILE WE FOUND NO EFFECT FOR LINEAR HEDGEROWS.

A SUITABLE RIPARIAN ZONE WAS IDENTIFIED AT CUDDESDON MILL ON THE RIVER THAME FLOODPLAIN NEAR OXFORD, ENGLAND. MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE OF WATER AND NITRATE MOVING FROM ARABLE LAND THROUGH THE RIPARIAN ZONE AND INTO THE RIVER. TECHNIQUES TO MEASURE DENITRIFICATION WERE TESTED AND APPLIED, AND THE FACTORS CONTROLLING DENITRIFICATION MEASURED. WHILE THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL FOR DENITRIFICATION AT THE SITE, THIS WAS NOT REALIZED BECAUSE MUCH OF THE WATER MOVING OFF THE FARMLAND BYPASSED THE RIPARIAN ZONE, ENTERING THE RIVER DIRECTLY VIA SPRINGS OR THROUGH GRAVEL LENSES BENEATH THE FLOODPLAIN SOIL. MANAGEMENT OF THIS SITE WOULD NOT REDUCE NITRATE LEACHING UNLESS THE FLOODPLAIN HYDROLOGY COULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIED, AND THE MAIN CONCLUSION IS THAT NITRATE BUFFER ZONES WILL ONLY OPERATE EFFICIENTLY WHERE THE HYDROLOGY OF THE SITE IS APPROPRIATE.

THE IMPORTANCE OF HERBACEOUS, SHRUBBY AND WOODED RIPARIAN HABITATS FOR THE CONSERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY (PLANTS, AMPHIBIANS, REPTILES, BIRDS, SMALL MAMMALS) IS WELL DOCUMENTED FOR THE BOYER RIVER WATERSHED (SOUTHERN QUEBEC, CANADA). THIS PAPER EXAMINES THEIR CONSERVATION VALUE FOR THESE DIFFERENT TAXONOMIC GROUPS AT THE WATERSHED LEVEL AND THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS ON WILDLIFE OF VARIOUS LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION SCENARIOS. THE OVERALL SPECIES RICHNESS AND INSECTIVOROUS BIRD ABUNDANCE IN THE WATERSHED WOULD INCREASE MARKEDLY IF THERE WERE MORE WOODED STRIPS IN THE LANDSCAPE MAINLY DUE TO ADDITIONAL PLANT AND BIRD SPECIES. A SCENARIO WHERE ALL THREE TYPES OF RIPARIAN STRIPS WOULD BE WELL-REPRESENTED IN THE WATERSHED IS MOST LIKELY TO BE IMPLEMENTED. THIS SCENARIO WOULD BE THE MOST BENEFICIAL TO WILDLIFE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OF HIGH NATIVE SPECIES DIVERSITY WITHIN WOODED STRIPS COMBINED WITH THE PRESENCE OF UNIQUE SPECIES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THE THREE TYPES OF STRIPS. ENCOURAGING LANDOWNERS TO PROTECT EXISTING WOODED RIPARIAN HABITATS WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND COST-BENEFICIAL METHOD TO MAINTAIN CURRENT LEVEL OF HABITATS DISTRIBUTION IN THE LANDSCAPE, AND TO FAVOUR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW SHRUBBY AND WOODED STRIPS IN THE BOYER RIVER WATERSHED.","103","3","413","423","RIPARIAN ZONE; BIODIVERSITY; WILDLIFE CONSERVATION; WATERSHED; INTRODUCED SPECIES; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; WILDLIFE; SPECIES RICHNESS","","","","","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880904000052 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880904000052","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.AGEE.2003.12.014","","10.1016/j.agee.2003.12.014","2042148947","","0","001-119-786-453-188; 004-807-568-531-692; 010-005-782-767-308; 011-919-119-768-782; 015-863-314-524-72X; 020-360-071-779-440; 021-933-813-475-043; 024-497-656-423-856; 028-510-934-918-189; 031-712-522-366-166; 036-722-726-289-60X; 038-286-684-488-655; 039-208-787-164-04X; 043-062-864-287-955; 046-595-945-408-676; 047-800-573-929-302; 051-022-262-033-206; 060-306-751-394-513; 060-819-730-330-813; 063-003-550-683-547; 063-435-224-985-32X; 071-601-864-758-089; 076-024-864-231-820; 076-377-649-956-283; 084-744-111-694-770; 088-179-459-836-289; 090-434-065-856-305; 091-777-696-122-819; 104-230-077-662-702; 104-784-237-651-91X; 105-145-742-902-746; 108-007-092-968-56X; 109-486-533-700-153; 110-612-930-963-74X; 111-734-210-139-21X; 113-900-387-576-996; 114-537-516-364-782; 116-313-159-599-128; 119-209-557-350-650; 129-795-413-211-042; 131-890-915-002-520; 143-749-787-569-284; 145-199-506-693-553; 146-589-148-444-417; 158-345-384-701-811; 162-036-968-104-223; 169-637-192-822-911; 170-230-483-322-002; 175-669-428-011-95X; 176-481-005-284-747; 179-599-537-784-673; 180-440-450-858-597","41","BENOÎT JOBIN; LUC BÉLANGER; CÉLINE BOUTIN; CHARLES MAISONNEUVE","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","","LENS",0,"JOBIN B, 2004, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","JOBIN B, 2004, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT"

IN INTENSIVE FARM MANAGEMENT THE NUMBERS OF THESE BENEFICIAL ARTHROPOD SPECIES MAY BE CONSTRAINED BY A LACK OF ADDITIONAL PREY, FLORAL RESOURCES OR SUITABLE OVERWINTERING SITES. WHILE PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT TARGETED FIELD MARGIN MANAGEMENT CAN POSITIVELY INFLUENCE THE POPULATION DYNAMICS OF BENEFICIAL INSECTS, THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF THE VARIOUS RESOURCES PROVIDED BY THESE TARGETED MARGINS REMAINS UNCLEAR.; ; TO HELP OPTIMISE FIELD MARGINS FOR CONSERVATION BIOLOGICAL CONTROL, THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF THREE KEY RESOURCES; APHID PREY, FLORAL RESOURCES, AND GRASS OVERWINTERING SITES, IN SUPPORTING NATURAL ENEMIES OF CEREAL APHIDS WITHIN AN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE. TRIAL PLOTS WERE MANAGED ADJACENT TO WHEAT FIELDS WITHIN AGRO-ECOSYSTEMS IN THE UK TO ASSESS THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THREE RESOURCES IN ISOLATION AND IN COMBINATION. THE ABUNDANCE OF APHIDOPHAGOUS NATURAL ENEMIES WAS MONITORED WITH RESPECT TO THESE RESOURCES DURING TWO PERIODS; PRIOR TO CEREAL APHID INFESTATION IN THE CROP, AND DURING THE INFESTATION PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE ABUNDANCE OF CEREAL APHIDS AND NATURAL ENEMIES WAS MONITORED IN THE CROP NEXT TO THE TRIAL PLOTS DURING THE INFESTATION PERIOD. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT RESOURCE NEEDS OF NATURAL ENEMIES VARY BOTH OVER TIME AND BETWEEN NATURAL ENEMY GROUPS. SOME PREDATORS BENEFITED FROM HIGHER APHID ABUNDANCE, PARTICULARLY IN COMBINATION WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF FLORAL RESOURCES. FLORAL RESOURCES HAD THE GREATEST INDIVIDUAL EFFECT IN INCREASING NATURAL ENEMY ABUNDANCE, BOTH PRIOR TO AND DURING PERIODS OF APHID INFESTATION.

THE EFFECTS OF TWO PESTICIDE REGIMES (CONVENTIONAL AND REDUCED) ON SPIDERS WERE CONTRASTED WITH EFFECTS OF TWO TYPES OF CULTIVATION SYSTEMS (CUSTOMARY AND INTEGRATED FARMING PRACTICE). THE PLOTS UNDER THE CONVENTIONAL PESTICIDE REGIME WERE SPRAYED WITH HERBICIDES, INSECTICIDES, FUNGICIDES AND GROWTH REGULATORS ANNUALLY. THE PLOTS ON REDUCED PESTICIDE REGIME WERE TREATED ONLY WHEN THE CONTROL THRESHOLDS WERE EXCEEDED (IN 1992 WITH INSECTICIDE AND IN 1994 WITH HERBICIDE). THE PERENNIAL GRASS STRIPS (SOWN WITH A MIXTURE OF TIMOTHY, MEADOW FESCUE, RED CLOVER AND WHITE CLOVER) AT THE MARGINS OF THE TREATED PLOTS PROVIDED AN ADDITIONAL ELEMENT. SEASONAL PATTERNS OF SPIDER CATCHES WERE QUITE SYNCHRONOUS IN THE FIELD AND IN THE PERENNIAL STRIP. NUMBER OF SPIDERS WERE CLEARLY HIGHER IN PERENNIAL STRIPS THAN IN THE FIELD. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPOSITION OF SPIDER FAUNA DIFFERED BETWEEN CERELA PLOTS AND PERENNIAL GRASS STRIPS. LYCOSIDAE DOMINATED IN GRASS STRIPS, WHEREAS IN CEREAL FIELDS THE FAMILY LINYPHIIDAE WAS COMMON. THE DOMINANCE OF LYCOSIDAE IN GRASS STRIPS INCREASED FROM YEAR TO YEAR. THE PERENNIAL STRIPS AFFECTED THE SPIDER ABUNDANCE OF THE FIELD; TOTAL SPIDER CATCHES AND LYCOSIDAE CATCHES, BUT NOT LINYPHIIDAE, IN PITFALLS NEAR THE STRIPS WERE HIGHER THAN IN PITFALLS SITUATED FURTHER AWAY. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF PESTICIDE TREATMENTS ON SPIDER NUMBERS DID NOT DEPEND ON THE DISTANCE FROM THE PERENNIAL STRIP. REDUCED PESTICIDE USE PLOTS HAD GREATER TOTAL SPIDER CATCHES THAN CONVENTIONAL PLOTS IN 1992 AND 1994. IN BOTH YEARS THE DIFFERENCE WAS OBVIOUS FOR MORE THAN 3 WEEKS AFTER INSECTICIDE (DIMETHOATE) TREATMENT. IN 1992, PIRIMICARB WAS NEARLY HARMLESS TO SPIDERS COMPARED TO DIMETHOATE. IN 1994, THE DIMETHOATE TREATMENT (IN JUNE) DID NOT DECREASE CLEARLY THE ABUNDANCE OF SPIDERS, BUT DELTAMETHRIN TREATMENT (IN JULY) HAD DRAMATIC EFFECTS ON THE TOTAL SPIDER ABUNDANCE AND THE DIFFERENCE WAS STILL OBVIOUS IN THE LAST SAMPLING PERIOD. AT FAMILY LEVEL, THE EFFECTS OF PESTICIDE TREATMENTS VARIED BETWEEN FAMILIES. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PESTICIDE TREATMENTS WERE FOUND IN ALL YEARS IN LINYPHIIDAE NUMBERS, BUT IN LYCOSIDAE ONLY IN 1994. DURING THE PERIOD OF 3 YEARS, NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN THE NUMBERS OF SPIDERS BETWEEN THE TWO CULTIVATION SYSTEMS TESTED.","122","1-5","575","583","PESTICIDE; PERENNIAL PLANT; RED CLOVER; LINYPHIIDAE; DIMETHOATE; SPIDER; PIRIMICARB; BOTANY; AGRONOMY; FIELD EXPERIMENT; BIOLOGY","","","","","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0418.1998.tb01548.x https://eurekamag.com/research/003/120/003120105.php","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1439-0418.1998.TB01548.X","","10.1111/j.1439-0418.1998.tb01548.x","2164100502","","0","008-608-775-518-291; 012-957-390-358-741; 014-332-067-655-642; 015-888-533-237-30X; 019-525-194-632-85X; 022-041-044-419-946; 027-023-964-826-432; 030-652-847-337-20X; 033-145-570-790-134; 033-797-072-560-76X; 035-512-326-342-385; 038-445-105-507-360; 038-660-521-275-273; 041-281-305-731-551; 047-711-433-977-172; 048-787-364-927-805; 063-714-053-560-07X; 064-338-086-975-394; 072-817-046-222-302; 074-811-254-859-725; 079-949-881-121-678; 086-229-373-154-965; 087-186-786-234-321; 087-506-904-720-671; 097-891-727-359-251; 101-797-752-209-310; 108-481-854-808-457; 118-409-347-010-789; 122-593-714-312-795; 122-765-477-485-788; 131-462-888-884-79X; 136-711-748-967-039; 138-845-934-876-76X; 140-120-948-871-39X; 148-628-032-380-601; 149-558-325-746-238; 154-143-746-540-082; 168-458-339-894-814; 193-784-606-708-810","30","E.

SEMI-NATURAL VEGETATION AND DIVERSE CROPPING SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN CONVERTED INTO MONOCULTURES WITH LOW TREE DENSITIES, LEAVING THE SOIL UNPROTECTED. WE EVALUATED THE ASSOCIATION IN SOIL- AND WATER-CONSERVATION SYSTEMS WITH PRODUCTION IN TRADITIONAL ALMOND ORCHARDS AND THE BENEFICIAL IMPACT OF PLANT STRIPS IN MOUNTAINOUS AGRICULTURE. SOIL LOSS, RUNOFF AND NUTRIENT LOSS OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD (2002–2005) WERE MONITORED IN HILLSIDE EROSION PLOTS WITH ALMOND TREES UNDER DIFFERENT SOIL-MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS: (1) NON-TILLAGE WITH SAGE (SALVIA LAVANDULIFOLIA L. SUBSPECIES OXYODON) STRIPS 3 M WIDE; (2) NON-TILLAGE WITH ROSEMARY (ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS L.) STRIPS, (3) NON-TILLAGE WITH THYME (THYMUS BAETICUS L. BOISS. EXLACAITA) STRIPS, AND (4) CONVENTIONAL TILLAGE ON THE SOUTH FLANK OF THE SIERRA NEVADA (LANJARON) IN SOUTH-EASTERN SPAIN. ALSO, THE NUT YIELD FROM ALMOND TREES, AND THE BIOMASS FROM AROMATIC-SHRUB STRIPS WERE MEASURED. THE EROSION PLOTS, LOCATED ON A 35% SLOPE, WERE 144 M2 IN AREA. THE PLANT-COVER STRIPS, 3 M WIDE, RAN ACROSS THE SLOPE. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENT PROVED TO BE NON-TILLAGE WITH THYME STRIPS, REDUCING THE ANNUAL SOIL LOSS BY 93% AND RUNOFF BY 80%, WITH RESPECT TO CONVENTIONAL TILLAGE. NON-TILLAGE WITH ROSEMARY STRIPS REDUCED SOIL LOSS BY 91 % AND RUNOFF BY 82%, WITH RESPECT TO CONVENTIONAL TILLAGE, WHILE THESE PERCENTAGES WERE 69% AND 51%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR NON-TILLAGE WITH SAGE STRIPS. IN ADDITION, ALL THE TREATMENTS AS A WHOLE, IN COMPARISON WITH CONVENTIONAL TILLAGE, REVEALED THAT THE PLANT STRIPS WERE THE DECISIVE FACTOR IN THE REDUCTION OF NPK LOSSES BY SURFACE RUNOFF. THE AVERAGE NUT YIELD FROM NON-TILLAGE WITH SAGE STRIPS, NON-TILLAGE WITH ROSEMARY STRIPS, NON-TILLAGE WITH THYME STRIPS AND CONVENTIONAL TILLAGE DURING THE STUDY PERIOD WAS 2.4, 3.2, 3.8 AND 4.5 KG TREE−1, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE ESSENTIAL OIL YIELD FROM SAGE, ROSEMARY AND THYME STRIPS WAS 5.0, 8.7 AND 10.8 L HA−1, RESPECTIVELY. THE NON-TILLAGE WITH THYME STRIPS DECREASED NUTRIENT LOADING IN SURFACE WATERS AND THUS HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY MAINTAINING REASONABLE ALMOND-PRODUCTION LEVELS. THUS, THE COMBINATION OF ORCHARD TREES WITH SHRUBS PROVIDED A VIABLE OPTION TO CONSERVE SOIL AND WATER IN HILLY AREAS WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE OVERALL LAND PRODUCTIVITY AS WELL AS SUSTAINABLE AGRO-ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES.","28","4","497","505","EROSION; MONOCULTURE; VEGETATION; ECOLOGY; SOIL QUALITY; SALVIA LAVANDULIFOLIA; CONVENTIONAL TILLAGE; ORCHARD; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SURFACE RUNOFF; AGRONOMY","","","","","https://www.agronomy-journal.org/articles/agro/pdf/2008/04/a7212.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1051/agro%3A2008020 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00886462/document http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/agro:2008020 https://dx.doi.org/10.1051/agro:2008020 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00886462 https://rd.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1051%2Fagro%3A2008020.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1051/AGRO:2008020","","10.1051/agro:2008020","1975555965","","0","000-550-242-915-286; 003-630-309-310-353; 003-730-166-192-529; 004-239-815-184-200; 014-331-710-973-275; 023-145-818-979-019; 027-430-314-450-435; 028-034-500-501-517; 034-946-583-952-83X; 036-498-767-059-823; 038-799-995-387-011; 040-313-510-158-034; 040-784-855-109-386; 041-451-335-230-183; 041-956-308-021-638; 042-998-407-701-227; 044-820-250-067-153; 047-689-880-239-819; 051-357-304-178-29X; 056-237-951-331-786; 057-772-080-438-860; 059-751-194-635-483; 062-674-858-639-324; 064-995-738-937-503; 069-927-558-950-628; 072-317-138-666-604; 074-086-048-887-232; 075-826-877-292-110; 076-286-192-272-290; 076-863-314-595-731; 078-957-886-151-589; 081-098-412-792-638; 084-212-592-803-466; 085-202-543-323-156; 086-812-760-777-597; 087-360-681-728-49X; 088-048-841-192-621; 088-465-171-238-228; 089-814-797-296-12X; 091-084-700-225-465; 097-606-668-251-99X; 101-254-834-335-141; 106-153-659-278-782; 117-860-348-832-477; 122-366-019-593-740; 124-334-470-681-725; 128-052-928-327-315; 132-233-286-245-058; 141-101-347-131-583; 147-835-879-637-252; 150-984-861-982-282; 164-821-291-483-482; 165-184-942-341-398; 165-299-427-858-800; 166-648-088-163-172; 169-607-559-923-667; 172-803-529-358-122; 175-231-710-696-191; 191-753-572-738-485; 193-256-129-811-532","26","VÍCTOR HUGO DURÁN ZUAZO; CARMEN ROCÍO RODRÍGUEZ PLEGUEZUELO; JOSÉ RAMÓN FRANCIA MARTÍNEZ; ARMANDO MARTÍNEZ RAYA; LORENZO ARROYO PANADERO; BELÉN CÁRCELES RODRÍGUEZ; MARIA CONCEPTIÓN NAVARRO MOLL","AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","","LENS",0,"ZUAZO VHD, 2008, AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","ZUAZO VHD, 2008, AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT"

THE STRIPS (SCIENCE-BASED TRIALS OF ROW CROPS INTEGRATED WITH PRAIRIES) PROJECT IS A WATERSHEDSCALE EXPERIMENT AT THE NEAL SMITH NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, IN JASPER COUNTY, IOWA, US, IN WHICH STRIPS OF PRAIRIE VEGETATION WERE PLANTED WITHIN WATERSHEDS OF CORN (ZEA MAYS) AND SOYBEAN (GLYCINE MAX) PRODUCTION TO AID IN SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION. THE PROJECT INCLUDES 12 0.5TO 3.2-HA WATERSHEDS. NINE WATERSHEDS INCLUDED BUFFER STRIPS IN ONE OF THREE DESIGN TREATMENTS THAT VARIED THE NUMBER AND POSITION OF STRIPS AND/OR THE PROPORTION OF THE WATERSHED CONVERTED TO BUFFER AND THREE WATERSHEDS WERE 100% CROP. THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATED: (1) IF THE DESIGN OF PRAIRIE BUFFER STRIPS INFLUENCED THEIR VEGETATION; (2) IF THE VEGETATION OF PRAIRIE BUFFER STRIPS SHIFTED OVER TIME; (3) IF PRAIRIE BUFFER STRIPS CAUSED A WEED PROBLEM IN ADJACENT CROP FIELDS. FROM 2008-2011, THE IDENTITY AND PERCENT COVER OF PLANT SPECIES WITHIN THE BUFFER STRIPS WERE SURVEYED, AND FROM 2009-2011, THE IDENTITY AND PERCENT COVER OF WEED SPECIES WITHIN THE CROPPED AREAS OF THE WATERSHEDS WERE SURVEYED. DIFFERENCES AMONG TREATMENTS AND AMONG YEARS IN PLANT SPECIES DIVERSITY, PERCENT COVER, AND COMPOSITION WERE ANALYZED USING ANOVA AND NMS. THE DESIGN OF BUFFER STRIPS DID NOT INFLUENCE PLANT SPECIES DIVERSITY OR COMPOSITION; HOWEVER, BUFFER STRIP VEGETATION DID SHIFT OVER TIME. IN 2008, THE STRIPS HAD 38 SPECIES (IN 6 M) WITH 37% OF THE TOTAL PLANT COVER COMPOSED OF PERENNIAL SPECIES AND 22% COMPOSED OF NATIVE PERENNIAL SPECIES. BY 2011, THE STRIPS HAD 55 SPECIES (IN 6 M) WITH 90% OF THE TOTAL PLANT COVER COMPOSED OF PERENNIAL SPECIES AND 58% COMPOSED OF NATIVE PERENNIAL SPECIES. IN ADDITION, NMS ANALYSES INDICATED THAT THE BUFFER STRIP PLANT COMMUNITY SHIFTED FROM ANNUAL TO PERENNIAL SPECIES. WITHIN THE CROP, WEED SPECIES RICHNESS AND PERCENT COVER DID NOT DIFFER AMONG WATERSHED TREATMENTS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WATERSHEDS CONTAINED BUFFER STRIPS OR NOT.

YOUNG AND OLD, SOWN AND NATURALLY DEVELOPED FIELD MARGIN STRIPS WERE COMPARED AND DIFFERENCES TO LARGE FALLOWS ESTABLISHED. THE FIVE TYPES OF FIELD MARGIN STRIPS (AROUND CEREAL FIELDS) WERE: (1, 2) 1- OR 6-YEAR-OLD NATURALLY DEVELOPED STRIPS, (3) STRIPS SOWN WITH A PHACELIA MIXTURE, (4) STRIPS SOWN WITH A MIXTURE OF 19 WILD FLOWER SPECIES, AND (5) STRIPS SOWN WITH WINTER WHEAT OR OAT AS A CONTROL. THE NATURALLY DEVELOPED VEGETATION OF THE FIELD MARGIN STRIPS WAS DOMINATED BY AGGRESSIVE WEEDS, PRESUMABLY DUE TO THE INTENSIVE FARMING PRACTICES AND THE FERTILE SOILS. CIRSIUM ARVENSE POPULATIONS DECREASED, WHILE ELYMUS REPENS POPULATIONS INCREASED WITH AGE OF HABITAT. SOWINGS WERE SUITABLE TO SUPPRESS THESE AGGRESSIVE WEEDS. POTTED PLANTS OF MUGWORT (ARTEMISIA VULGARIS) AND RED CLOVER (TRIFOLIUM PRATENSE) WERE EXPOSED IN THE FIELD MARGIN STRIPS TO STUDY ARTHROPOD COLONIZATION OF THESE EXPERIMENTALLY STANDARDIZED PLANT PATCHES. ARTHROPOD SPECIES RICHNESS DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN FIELD MARGIN TYPES, REFLECTING THE OVERALL SIMILARITY IN FLORISTIC DIVERSITY, BUT SPRAYED AND STRIP-FREE EDGES OF CEREAL FIELDS HAD A REDUCED DIVERSITY. DISPERSAL OF INSECT POPULATIONS OF RED CLOVER INTO THE CEREAL FIELDS DECREASED WITH INCREASING DISTANCE, BUT BENEFITED FROM ADJACENT FIELD MARGIN STRIPS. POPULATIONS OF PREDATORS (MAINLY SPIDERS) AS WELL AS PREDATOR-PREY RATIOS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER IN 6-YEAR-OLD THAN IN 1-YEAR-OLD STRIPS EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF HABITAT AGE FOR NATURAL ENEMIES AND POSSIBLE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL. PREDATOR-PREY RATIOS WERE ALSO HIGHER ON OLD THAN YOUNG FALLOWS. LARGE FALLOWS HAD GREATER PREDATOR-PREY RATIOS THAN SMALL FIELD MARGIN STRIPS EMPHASIZING THE TROPHIC-LEVEL HYPOTHESIS OF ISLAND BIOGEOGRAPHY IN THAT THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF NATURAL ENEMIES INCREASED WITH HABITAT AREA.

HERE, WE TESTED WHETHER STANDARD HIGHER-TIER AES AGREEMENTS TARGETED AT MULTIPLE SPECIES AND WITH LOWER LEVELS OF ADVISORY SUPPORT THAN TARGETED SPECIES RECOVERY PROGRAMMES CAN ENHANCE THE BREEDING DENSITIES OF FARMLAND BIRDS. SURVEYS OF BREEDING BIRDS WERE UNDERTAKEN DURING 2008 AND 2011 ON 65 FARMS UNDER HIGHER LEVEL STEWARDSHIP (HLS) AND 21 FARMS LACKING AES INTERVENTIONS, IN THREE REGIONS OF ENGLAND. AFTER ALLOWING FOR ANY IMPACTS OF PREDATOR CONTROL, CHANGES IN DENSITY WERE MORE POSITIVE ON HLS FARMS IN AT LEAST ONE REGION FOR SIX PRIORITY SPECIES.

YELLOWHAMMER EMBERIZA CITRINELLA POPULATIONS HAVE DECLINED RAPIDLY IN THE UK OVER RECENT DECADES, AND A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR HABITAT REQUIREMENTS IS IMPORTANT TO HELP INFORM CONSERVATION SCHEMES. WE AIMED TO DISENTANGLE AND RANK THE EFFECTS OF WINTER VERSUS BREEDING SEASON HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS. 2. WE USED INFORMATION THEORETIC METHODS TO ANALYSE THE FACTORS DETERMINING YELLOWHAMMER DISTRIBUTION ACROSS 26 SITES IN ENGLAND AND WALES. WE DID THIS AT TWO SPATIAL LEVELS: INDIVIDUAL FIELD BOUNDARIES AND INDIVIDUAL TERRITORIES, THE LATTER CONSISTING OF SPATIAL CLUSTERS OF BOUNDARIES. 3. WE CONSIDERED THE ROLE OF NINE PREDICTOR VARIABLES, ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED IN THE LITERATURE AS POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT. THESE COMPRISED BOUNDARY HEIGHT AND WIDTH, AND THE PRESENCE OF HEDGES, TREES, DITCHES, BOUNDARY STRIPS, TILLAGE CROPS, WINTER SET-ASIDE AND WINTER STUBBLES. 4. THE RESULTS OF THE STATISTICAL MODELLING SHOWED THAT WINTER HABITATS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN DETERMINING WHERE BIRDS LOCATE TERRITORIES IN SUMMER. IN PARTICULAR, THE PRESENCE OF ROTATIONAL SET-ASIDE FIELDS IN WINTER SHOWED THE STRONGEST ASSOCIATION WITH SUMMER TERRITORIES. 5. THERE WERE MINOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TERRITORY- AND BOUNDARY-BASED MODELS. MOST NOTABLY, THE TERRITORY DATA DEMONSTRATED A STRONG PREFERENCE FOR TERRITORIES CONTAINING TREES, BUT THIS WAS NOT OBSERVED IN THE BOUNDARY DATA SET. WE SUGGEST THAT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MODELS MAY REFLECT DIFFERENT SCALES OF HABITAT SELECTION. BOUNDARY OCCUPANCY REFLECTS BROAD DISTRIBUTIONS OF HABITAT SUITABILITY; TERRITORY OCCUPANCY PATTERNS BETTER REVEAL DETAILED HABITAT REQUIREMENTS. 6. REGIONAL DENSITIES WERE MORE CLOSELY CORRELATED WITH THE PREDICTIONS OF THE BOUNDARYBASED MODEL THAN THOSE OF THE TERRITORY-BASED MODEL, AND WE DISCUSS THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS FOR INTERPRETING HABITAT ASSOCIATION MODELS. 7. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. PROVISION OF WINTER SET-ASIDE FIELDS FOR SUMMER TERRITORY SELECTION BY YELLOWHAMMERS IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION FOR FARM MANAGEMENT WHERE CONSERVATION IS A PRIORITY. WE SHOW THAT MODELS BASED ON OCCUPANCY OF INDIVIDUAL BOUNDARY UNITS (E.G. HEDGEROWS) CORRELATE WITH THE DENSITY OF TERRITORIES AT THE FARM SCALE; THUS FARM MANAGEMENT PRACTICES LINK DIRECTLY TO POPULATION SIZES THROUGH EFFECTS ON THE QUALITY OF BREEDING HABITAT.","42","2","270","280","ECOSYSTEM; OCCUPANCY; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; METAPOPULATION; GEOGRAPHY; EMBERIZIDAE; POPULATION; YELLOWHAMMER; EMBERIZA CITRINELLA","","","","","https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/70386 http://www.avibirds.com/pdf/G/Geelgors5.pdf http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01007.x/full https://iris.unito.it/handle/2318/125492 https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/file_store/production/56363/E88B4220-DA5D-4E4F-84C7-69A990FF9897.pdf https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01007.x https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/301900730.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1365-2664.2005.01007.X","","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01007.x","1661169526","","0","002-234-862-186-238; 003-523-629-064-477; 004-010-787-386-28X; 004-367-332-738-009; 006-174-981-795-443; 008-414-929-791-157; 011-305-198-094-715; 013-663-932-641-262; 014-335-179-532-157; 017-708-454-247-712; 020-167-621-399-502; 021-419-559-384-303; 029-705-760-353-953; 030-831-977-852-027; 031-592-787-048-258; 031-706-636-786-651; 032-245-730-539-873; 036-462-220-855-768; 036-556-226-795-548; 045-640-805-432-475; 046-462-915-703-966; 048-465-576-777-042; 053-191-268-007-391; 064-454-510-982-621; 066-596-627-924-034; 068-669-359-350-27X; 068-896-840-083-964; 071-601-656-233-384; 071-720-382-141-598; 072-224-176-896-782; 073-798-803-161-275; 074-197-517-203-385; 074-858-215-592-675; 077-142-531-895-649; 079-261-909-912-581; 081-184-406-382-06X; 088-099-886-225-087; 091-415-969-356-605; 093-431-710-793-083; 096-074-282-606-638; 097-681-694-700-322; 098-498-632-504-327; 104-762-500-201-442; 110-766-047-364-379; 111-728-793-696-876; 112-215-225-829-127; 114-788-294-317-652; 117-600-140-662-332; 119-209-557-350-650; 123-454-948-311-636; 143-250-679-860-16X; 145-728-200-767-581; 156-769-280-292-837; 157-952-430-903-966; 160-397-778-425-713","173","MARK J.

NITRATE PATHWAYS IN THE UPPER 2 M OF GROUNDWATER WERE INVESTIGATED BENEATH WOODED AND GRASS-SHRUB RIPARIAN ZONES NEXT TO CULTIVATED FIELDS. BECAUSE TREES CAN BE IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF THE OVERALL NITRATE PATHWAY IN WOODED RIPARIAN ZONES, WATER SOURCES USED BY RIPARIAN TREES AND POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF TREES ON NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS IN GROUNDWATER WERE ALSO INVESTIGATED. AVERAGE NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS IN SHALLOW GROUNDWATER BENEATH THE CULTIVATED FIELDS WERE 5.5 MG/L UPGRADIENT OF THE WOODED RIPARIAN ZONE AND 3.5 MG/L UPGRADIENT OF THE GRASS-SHRUB ZONE. SHALLOW GROUNDWATER BENEATH THE FIELDS PASSED THROUGH THE RIPARIAN ZONES AND DISCHARGED INTO STREAMS THAT HAD AVERAGE NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS OF 8.5 MG/L (AS N). LATERAL VARIATIONS OF ΔD VALUES IN GROUNDWATER SHOWED THAT MIXING AMONG DIFFERENT WATER SOURCES OCCURRED BENEATH THE RIPARIAN ZONES. IN THE WOODED RIPARIAN ZONE, NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS IN SHALLOW GROUNDWATER WERE DILUTED BY UPWELLING, NITRATE-POOR, DEEP GROUNDWATER. UPWELLING DEEP GROUNDWATER CONTAINED AMMONIUM WITH A Δ15N OF 5‰ THAT UPON NITRIFICATION AND MIXING WITH NITRATE IN SHALLOW GROUNDWATER CAUSED NITRATE Δ15N VALUES IN SHALLOW GROUNDWATER TO DECREASE BY AS MUCH AS 19.5‰. STREAM WATER PENETRATED LATERALLY BENEATH THE WOODED RIPARIAN ZONE AS FAR AS 19 M FROM THE STREAM'S EDGE AND BENEATH THE GRASS-SHRUB ZONE AS FAR AS 27 M FROM THE STREAM'S EDGE. NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS IN SHALLOW GROUNDWATER IMMEDIATELY UPGRADIENT OF WHERE IT MIXED WITH STREAM WATER AVERAGED 0.4 MG/L IN THE WOODED RIPARIAN ZONE AND 0.8 MG/L NEAR THE GRASS-SHRUB RIPARIAN ZONE. NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS INCREASED TOWARD THE STREAMS BECAUSE OF MIXING WITH NITRATE-RICH STREAM WATER. BECAUSE NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS WERE LARGER IN STREAM WATER THAN SHALLOW GROUNDWATER, CONCENTRATED NITRATE IN THE STREAMS CANNOT HAVE COME FROM SHALLOW GROUNDWATER AT THESE SITES. WATER SOURCES OF RIPARIAN TREES WERE IDENTIFIED BY COMPARING ΔD VALUES OF SAP WATER, SOIL WATER, GROUNDWATER, AND STREAM WATER. SOIL WATER WAS THE MAIN WATER SOURCE FOR TREES IN THE OUTER 4 TO 6 M OF ONE PART OF THE WOODED RIPARIAN ZONE AND OUTER 10 M OF ANOTHER PART. GROUNDWATER WAS A SIGNIFICANT WATER SOURCE FOR TREES CLOSER TO THE STREAMS WHERE THE WATER TABLE WAS LESS THAN ABOUT 2.1 TO 2.7 M BELOW THE SURFACE. NO EVIDENCE WAS FOUND IN THE NITRATE CONCENTRATION PROFILES THAT TREES CLOSE TO THE STREAMS THAT TOOK UP GROUNDWATER THROUGH THEIR ROOTS ALSO TOOK UP NITRATE FROM GROUNDWATER. THE LACK OF SUCH EVIDENCE IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE NITRATE CONCENTRATION PROFILES BEING INSUFFICIENTLY SENSITIVE INDICATORS OF NITRATE REMOVAL BY TREES.","32","4","1039","1050","RIPARIAN ZONE; GEOLOGY; GROUNDWATER FLOW; RIPARIAN FOREST; SOIL WATER; GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; NITRATE; HYDROLOGY; WATER TABLE; GROUNDWATER","","","","","https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996WRR....32.1039K/abstract https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/95WR03815 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/95WR03815/full http://doi.wiley.com/10.1029/95WR03815 https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70170925 https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/nitrate-in-groundwater-and-water-sources-used-by-riparian-trees-i","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1029/95WR03815","","10.1029/95wr03815","2098391642","","0","002-517-421-135-937; 002-937-270-631-538; 003-261-661-694-180; 006-036-573-934-234; 008-673-175-457-633; 012-899-875-361-698; 015-845-007-122-254; 017-462-329-161-146; 018-859-894-068-595; 031-242-683-380-192; 038-659-320-814-260; 046-008-989-596-85X; 050-989-784-672-519; 053-093-567-362-36X; 068-308-610-693-130; 075-283-748-830-527; 076-793-963-794-895; 079-961-989-935-966; 082-845-963-965-366; 083-547-733-666-951; 083-963-827-207-580; 103-186-016-967-957; 103-382-458-906-48X; 111-435-647-398-863; 113-957-143-269-073; 125-598-163-392-582; 129-339-977-188-475; 132-186-585-542-192; 138-762-735-726-300; 143-071-949-348-067; 143-446-554-315-090; 145-923-048-358-751; 150-539-908-471-485; 160-168-937-811-306","35","STEPHEN C.

IN SEPTEMBER 2000 WE RELEASED GROUPS OF BOBWHITES INTO 9 BUFFER STRIP (TREATMENT) AREAS AND 9 NON-BUFFER STRIP (CONTROL) AREAS AMONG 11 AGRICULTURAL FARMS. EACH GROUP CONSISTED OF 4 RADIOMARKED BOBWHITES AND 26 NON-RADIOMARKED BOBWHITES. TO MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH THE ESTABLISHED COVEYS, ADDITIONAL RADIOMARKED BOBWHITES (N 177) WERE INTRODUCED INTO THE COVEYS AS RADIOMARKED BIRDS DIED. SURVIVAL FOR BOBWHITES RELEASED IN BUFFER STRIP AREAS WAS LOWER (P 0.001) THAN SURVIVAL IN NON-BUFFER STRIP AREAS. NONE OF THE RADIOMARKED BOBWHITES RELEASED IN THE BUFFER STRIP AREAS SURVIVED PAST 27 WEEKS, WHEREAS 11% OF RADIOMARKED BOBWHITES IN NON-BUFFER STRIP AREAS SURVIVED TO 27 WEEKS AND 1 BIRD SURVIVED TO 41 WEEKS. PREDATION WAS THE PRIMARY MORTALITY FACTOR (88%), FOLLOWED BY UNKNOWN CAUSES (7%), STRESS (2%), HUNTING (2%), AND ROAD KILL (1%). MEAN FALL AND WINTER HOME RANGE (95% MINIMUM CONVEX POLYGON) FOR 21 BOBWHITE COVEYS WAS 24.2 3.5 HA, RANGING FROM 1.7 TO 65.8 HA. HOME RANGE AREAS OF BOBWHITE COVEYS IN BUFFER STRIPS (N 12, X 15.0 2.7 HA) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER (P 0.002) THAN NON-BUFFER STRIP COVEYS (N 9, X 36.4 4.9 HA).

HERE, WE USE A UK-WIDE VEGETATION SURVEY COVERING A RANGE OF BOTH HABITATS AND LANDSCAPE FEATURES (E.G. FIELDS, HEDGEROWS, WATERWAYS AND ROADSIDES) TO IDENTIFY THE HABITATS AND FEATURES WITH THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF CWR IDENTIFIED AS PRIORITY TAXA FOR CONSERVATION. PRIORITY CWR WERE MOST ABUNDANT IN GRASSLAND HABITATS, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS MOST STRIKING IN CWR RELATED TO FORAGE AND FODDER CROPS. CWR RELATED TO FOOD CROPS WERE MOST COMMON IN CROPPED AND WEEDY AREAS, FERTILE GRASSLAND AND LOWLAND WOODLAND. WITHIN HABITATS, CWR OCCURRENCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH LINEAR FEATURES INCLUDING HEDGEROWS, ROADSIDES, FIELD BOUNDARIES AND FIELD MARGINS. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT CWR OF CONSERVATION INTEREST ARE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH DISTURBED HABITATS AND LANDSCAPE FEATURES THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED AS PRIORITIES UNDER SITE-BASED CONSERVATION MEASURES. WE SUGGEST THAT EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN LINEAR FEATURES IN HOTSPOTS OF CWR DIVERSITY WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE AT CONSERVING THE UK'S CWR RESOURCE.","191","","444","451","AGRICULTURE; RESOURCE (BIOLOGY); VEGETATION; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; RANGE (BIOLOGY); WOODLAND; GEOGRAPHY; GRASSLAND; AGROFORESTRY; FOOD SECURITY","","","","","https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/distribution-of-crop-wild-relatives-of-conservation-priority-in-the-uk-landscape(00f4fc57-055f-4fe0-a846-5e6721d7945e).html https://core.ac.uk/display/33453080 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632071530046X https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632071530046X https://core.ac.uk/download/33453080.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.BIOCON.2015.07.039","","10.1016/j.biocon.2015.07.039","1072819144","","0","000-089-017-499-324; 000-103-713-547-965; 001-362-855-145-788; 003-803-365-367-189; 005-400-528-310-627; 009-067-499-774-121; 010-225-312-935-498; 010-258-981-642-693; 012-187-317-384-830; 020-715-514-086-978; 029-892-516-732-245; 032-092-568-630-622; 043-092-532-269-854; 043-915-956-408-584; 047-049-258-765-792; 047-546-677-833-03X; 047-733-221-799-180; 048-730-712-854-60X; 053-811-972-418-973; 055-360-809-811-970; 055-675-734-683-13X; 056-391-120-745-502; 056-789-845-462-569; 061-737-537-260-97X; 063-828-102-408-126; 070-365-342-030-594; 073-155-361-098-782; 082-395-769-409-416; 092-439-066-619-681; 098-622-173-826-196; 117-345-687-903-78X; 132-572-293-438-348; 146-591-253-297-028; 150-325-162-873-23X; 164-519-333-127-754; 166-682-614-885-036; 180-157-128-386-145; 188-475-265-660-82X","45","SUSAN G.

IN THE POLICY CONTEXT BUFFER STRIPS ARE REFERRED TO AS LAND WITH DEFINED FARMING RESTRICTIONS AIMING AT PROTECTING THE WATER COURSE. IN THE CURRENT EU AGRICULTURAL POLICY FRAMEWORK THE MAJORITY OF THE DECISIONS REGARDING SUBSIDY SCHEMES FOR BUFFER STRIPS IS TAKEN ON THE MEMBER COUNTRY LEVEL, WHICH RESULTS IN GREAT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE EU MEMBERS WITH REGARD TO THIS WATER PROTECTION MEASURE. IF INCENTIVES FOR FARMERS FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING BUFFER STRIPS ARE IN PLACE, THEY ARE USUALLY LINKED TO THE HARVEST BAN ON THE BUFFER STRIP. SUCH PROTECTION MODEL CAN BE ENDANGERED BY VOLATILE AND RISING PRICES FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, BUFFER STRIP CAN REPRESENT A VALUABLE SOURCE OF DIFFERENT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, INCLUDING BIOMASS PROVISION. IF HARVESTING UNDER CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS WOULD BE ALLOWED, THE BIOMASS COULD GENERATE ADDITIONAL REVENUE THAT MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO SECURING BUFFER STRIPS EXISTENCE AND CONSEQUENTLY MAINTAINING THEIR PROTECTION FUNCTION. THIS STUDY AIMED AT ASSESSING THE COSTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES OF BIOMASS MOBILIZING FROM BUFFER STRIPS. IT DEALT WITH DIFFERENT SCENARIOS OF BIOMASS SOURCING FROM EXTENSIVELY CULTIVATED BUFFER STRIPS IN THE NETHERLANDS. IN 12 SCENARIOS, THE CULTIVATION OF GRASS OR CEREAL MIXES (INCLUDING MULTIPLE HARVESTING OR PERENNIAL CULTIVATION) FOR DIFFERENT VALORISATION CHAINS (ENSILING OR FODDER & BEDDING) WAS ASSESSED. BOTH TOTAL NET CULTIVATION COSTS AS WELL AS THE HECTARE BASED ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE (USING THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY) WERE EVALUATED. ADDITIONALLY, THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION THROUGH ANAEROBIC DIGESTION OF BIOMASS FROM BUFFER STRIPS WAS COMPARED WITH THE IMPACT FROM DIGESTION OF CLASSIC GRASS SILAGE AND THE IMPACT PROFILE OF DUTCH ELECTRICITY MIX. THE RESULTS INDICATE ENSILING AS THE SCENARIO GENERATING MORE NET COSTS AND HIGHER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AS COMPARED TO FODDER & BEDDING. IN THE LATTER, THE CEREAL CULTIVATION REPRESENTS A BETTER SOLUTION FROM ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE, WHILE GRASS SHOWS LOWER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. MOREOVER, OPTIMIZING GRASS CULTIVATION THROUGH SWITCHING TO PERENNIAL MODE CONTRIBUTES TO STRONG IMPROVEMENTS OF THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND CONTRIBUTES TO ADDITIONAL REDUCTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, AND CONSEQUENTLY DELIVERS THE BEST ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC SOLUTION. MOREOVER, THE COMPARISON WITH THE DUTCH ELECTRICITY MIX SHOWS THAT BIOMASS FROM BUFFER STRIPS, IF USED IN ANAEROBIC DIGESTION, CAN, IN TERMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE, COMPETE WITH CLASSIC SILAGES AND CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCED ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.","57","","31","39","AGRICULTURE; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT; HECTARE; LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; BIOMASS; CONTEXT (LANGUAGE USE); ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; BUFFER STRIP; ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; AGRONOMY","","","","EUROPEAN COMMISSION","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901115301155","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2015.11.014","","10.1016/j.envsci.2015.11.014","2206631347","","0","000-048-563-958-611; 006-677-293-260-300; 006-962-356-363-116; 022-193-988-588-037; 038-029-852-973-098; 038-659-320-814-260; 044-537-569-855-131; 057-123-379-343-110; 063-230-432-702-460; 064-284-235-545-136; 072-894-925-030-71X; 095-237-569-744-605; 098-004-631-148-428; 107-935-859-632-582; 122-775-267-844-083; 127-777-796-113-391; 146-579-228-656-189; 146-606-352-041-123; 179-421-498-785-260","10","KATARZYNA GOLKOWSKA; BENEDETTO RUGANI; DANIEL KOSTER; COR VAN OERS","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY","","LENS",0,"GOLKOWSKA K, 2016, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY","GOLKOWSKA K, 2016, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY"

THIS STUDY AIMS TO ANALYSE THE SPATIAL AND SEASONAL INFLUENCES OF A HEDGEROW ON NITRATE DYNAMICS IN THE SOIL AND GROUNDWATER. NITRATE (NO3−) AND CHLORIDE (CL−) CONCENTRATIONS WERE MEASURED WITH SPATIALLY DENSE SAMPLING IN THE UNSATURATED SOIL AND IN THE GROUNDWATER ALONG A TRANSECT INTERSECTING A BOTTOMLAND OAK (QUERCUS RUBOR) HEDGEROW AFTER THE GROWING SEASON AND DURING THE DORMANT SEASON. WE EXPLAIN NO3− DYNAMICS BY USING CL− AS AN INDEX OF TREE-ROOT EXTENSION AND WATER TRANSFER. AT THE END OF THE GROWING SEASON, NO3− IS ENTIRELY ABSORBED BY THE TREES OVER A LARGE AND DEEP VOLUME CORRESPONDING TO THE ROOTING ZONE, WHERE, IN CONTRAST CL− IS HIGHLY CONCENTRATED DUE TO ROOT EXCLUSION. HOWEVER, THESE OBSERVED PATTERNS IN THE SOIL HAVE NO INFLUENCE ON THE DEEP GROUNDWATER COMPOSITION AT THIS SEASON. DURING THE DORMANT SEASON, WATER TRANSFER PROCESSES FEEDING THE SHALLOW GROUNDWATER LAYER ARE DIFFERENT UPSLOPE AND DOWNSLOPE FROM THE HEDGEROW IN RELATION TO THE THICKNESS OF THE UNSATURATED ZONE. UPSLOPE, THE SHALLOW GROUNDWATER IS FED BY RAINWATER INFILTRATION THROUGH THE SOIL WHICH FAVOURS CL− DILUTION. RIGHT UNDER THE HEDGE AND DOWNSLOPE, THE RAPID ASCENT OF THE GROUNDWATER NEAR THE GROUND SURFACE PREVENTS RAINWATER INPUT AND CL− DILUTION. UNDER THE HEDGEROW THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS OF CL− COINCIDE WITH THE ABSENCE OF NO3− IN THE SHALLOW GROUNDWATER LAYER AND WITH HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON. THE ABSENCE OF NO3− DURING THE DORMANT SEASON SEEMS TO BE DUE TO DENITRIFICATION IN THE HEDGEROW ROOTING ZONE WHEN IT IS RAPIDLY SATURATED BY GROUNDWATER.

THE BUFFERSTRIP WAS A 3.5 M WIDE UNFERTILISED GRASS STRIP ADJACENT TO A DITCH ON AN ARABLE FIELD. IN TOTAL 24 GROUNDWATER WELLS WERE INSTALLED IN 4 TRANSECTS PERPENDICULAR TO THE DITCH TO DETERMINE CL, NO3 AND Δ15N CONCENTRATIONS. PIEZOMETERS WERE INSTALLED TO ASSESS THE GROUNDWATER FLOW, WHICH WAS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DITCH WITH SMALL DOWNWARD LEAKAGE ACROSS A PEAT LAYER AT ABOUT 3 M DEPTH. NITROGEN WAS DOMINANTLY PRESENT AS NITRATE (NO3). THE NO3-N CONCENTRATIONS UNDER THE BUFFERSTRIP WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN UNDER THE ADJACENT ARABLE FIELD. THE LOWER CONCENTRATIONS WERE DUE TO DILUTION, UPTAKE BY GRASS AND DENITRIFICATION. NITRATE WAS ACTIVELY REMOVED IN THE BUFFERSTRIP, SINCE THE CL/NO3 RATIOS WERE HIGHER IN THE BUFFERSTRIP THAN IN THE REMAINDER OF THE FIELD. FURTHERMORE, Δ15N DATA INDICATED THAT DENITRIFICATION OCCURRED IN THE GROUNDWATER AND INCREASED WITH DECREASING DISTANCE TO THE DITCH.

THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS EXPERIMENT WERE TO (I) ASSESS DENITRIFICATION ACTIVITY WITHIN A RIPARIAN ZONE AND (II) DETERMINE THE INFLUENCE OF PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, AND LANDSCAPE FEATURES ON DENITRIFICATION. THIS EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED FROM 1994 TO 1997 IN NORTH CAROLINA ON A RIPARIAN ZONE CONTIGUOUS TO A SPRAY FIELD THAT WAS HEAVILY LOADED WITH SWINE LAGOON WASTEWATER. DENITRIFICATION ENZYME ACTIVITY (DEA) WAS MEASURED ON SOILS COLLECTED FROM (I) THE SOIL SURFACE, (II) MIDWAY BETWEEN THE SOIL SURFACE AND WATER TABLE, AND (III) ABOVE THE WATER TABLE. THE DEA RANGED FROM 3 TO 1660 MICROG N(2)O-N KG(-1) SOIL H(-1). THE DEA WAS HIGHEST NEXT TO THE STREAM AND LOWEST NEXT TO THE SPRAY FIELD. NITRATE WAS FOUND TO BE THE LIMITING FACTOR FOR DENITRIFICATION. THE DEA GENERALLY DECREASED WITH SOIL DEPTH; MEANS FOR THE SURFACE, MIDDLE, AND BOTTOM DEPTHS WERE 147, 83, AND 67 MICROG N(2)O-N KG(-1) SOIL H(-1), RESPECTIVELY. THESE DEA VALUES ARE HIGHER THAN THOSE REPORTED FOR RIPARIAN ZONES ADJOINING CROPLAND OF THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES, BUT ARE LOWER THAN THOSE REPORTED FOR A CONSTRUCTED WETLAND USED FOR TREATMENT OF SWINE WASTEWATER. REGRESSION ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT SOIL TOTAL NITROGEN WAS THE HIGHEST SINGLE FACTOR CORRELATED TO DEA (R(2) = 0.65). THE INCLUSION OF WATER TABLE DEPTH, SOIL DEPTH, AND DISTANCE FROM THE SPRAY FIELD IMPROVED THE R(2) TO 0.86. THIS RIPARIAN ZONE POSSESSED SUFFICIENT SOIL AREA WITH HIGH DENITRIFYING CONDITIONS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THE REMOVAL OF EXCESS NITROGEN IN THE GROUND WATER.","33","6","2367","2374","RIPARIAN ZONE; SOIL WATER; DENITRIFYING BACTERIA; CONSTRUCTED WETLAND; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; WATER TABLE; DENITRIFICATION; GROUNDWATER; SURFACE WATER; ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING","","ANIMALS; ECOSYSTEM; FILTRATION; MANURE; NITROGEN/ANALYSIS; RIVERS; SOIL; SWINE; TREES; WASTE DISPOSAL, FLUID/METHODS; WATER POLLUTANTS/ANALYSIS; WATER POLLUTION/PREVENTION & CONTROL","MANURE; SOIL; WATER POLLUTANTS; NITROGEN","","https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/60820000/Manuscripts/2004/Man689.pdf https://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/60820000/Manuscripts/2004/Man689.pdf https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/33/6/2367 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2004.2367 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15537960","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.2134/JEQ2004.2367","15537960","10.2134/jeq2004.2367","2073530336","","0","012-899-875-361-698; 015-325-416-202-141; 016-437-799-863-096; 017-885-841-853-429; 021-187-528-186-865; 026-658-145-527-116; 030-587-602-032-688; 038-088-874-218-042; 048-513-319-982-524; 050-232-707-053-533; 053-093-567-362-36X; 054-510-754-647-273; 075-429-883-991-330; 075-731-436-057-973; 081-146-598-099-607; 083-258-693-486-102; 087-138-533-405-771; 104-993-597-055-071; 121-468-243-703-60X; 123-607-505-428-901; 137-890-167-917-845; 141-101-347-131-583; 149-173-692-977-372; 150-539-908-471-485; 168-149-351-696-563; 177-900-727-296-993","30","PATRICK G.

WHILE MANY CROPS BENEFIT FROM INSECT POLLINATION, SOFT FRUIT CROPS, INCLUDING STRAWBERRIES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THIS ECOSYSTEM SERVICE TO PRODUCE VIABLE FRUIT. HOWEVER, AS A RESULT OF INTENSIVE FARMING PRACTICES AND DECLINING POLLINATOR POPULATIONS, FARMERS ARE INCREASINGLY TURNING TO COMMERCIALLY REARED BEES TO ENSURE THAT CROPS ARE ADEQUATELY POLLINATED THROUGHOUT THE SEASON. WILDFLOWER STRIPS ARE A COMMONLY USED MEASURE AIMED AT THE CONSERVATION OF WILD POLLINATORS. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT COMMERCIAL CROPS MAY ALSO BENEFIT FROM THE PRESENCE OF NONCROP FLOWERS; HOWEVER, THE EFFICACY AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF SOWING FLOWER STRIPS FOR CROPS REMAIN RELATIVELY UNSTUDIED. IN A STUDY SYSTEM THAT UTILIZES BOTH WILD AND COMMERCIAL POLLINATORS, WE TEST WHETHER WILDFLOWER STRIPS INCREASE THE NUMBER OF VISITS TO ADJACENT COMMERCIAL STRAWBERRY CROPS BY POLLINATING INSECTS. WE QUANTIFIED THIS BY EXPERIMENTALLY SOWING WILDFLOWER STRIPS APPROXIMATELY 20 METERS AWAY FROM THE CROP AND RECORDING THE NUMBER OF POLLINATOR VISITS TO CROPS WITH, AND WITHOUT, FLOWER STRIPS. BETWEEN JUNE AND AUGUST 2013, WE WALKED 292 CROP TRANSECTS AT SIX FARMS IN SCOTLAND, RECORDING A TOTAL OF 2826 POLLINATORS. ON AVERAGE, THE FREQUENCY OF POLLINATOR VISITS WAS 25% HIGHER FOR CROPS WITH ADJACENT FLOWER STRIPS COMPARED TO THOSE WITHOUT, WITH A COMBINATION OF WILD AND COMMERCIAL BUMBLEBEES (BOMBUS SPP.) ACCOUNTING FOR 67% OF ALL POLLINATORS OBSERVED. THIS EFFECT WAS INDEPENDENT OF OTHER CONFOUNDING EFFECTS, SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS ON THE CROP, DATE, AND TEMPERATURE. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. THIS STUDY PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT SOFT FRUIT FARMERS CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF POLLINATORS THAT VISIT THEIR CROPS BY SOWING INEXPENSIVE FLOWER SEED MIXES NEARBY.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO CALIBRATE, VALIDATE AND SIMULATE RUNOFF AND SEDIMENT LOSSES AND COMPARE BUFFER EFFECTS ON NPSP LOSSES RELATIVE TO CONTROL WATERSHEDS (NO BUFFER) FOR SEVEN YEARS. THE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN CONSISTS OF FOUR WATERSHEDS UNDER PASTURE MANAGEMENT WHICH WERE MONITORED FROM 2002 THROUGH 2008; TWO WITH AGROFORESTRY BUFFERS (AGB 100 AND AGB 300) AND TWO CONTROL WATERSHEDS (CW 400 AND CW 600). PASTURE AREAS INCLUDED RED CLOVER (TRIFOLIUM PRETENSE L.) AND LESPEDEZA (KUMMEROWIA STIPULACEA MAXIM.) PLANTED INTO FESCUE (FESTUCA ARUNDINACEA SCHREB.) WHILE THE AGROFORESTRY BUFFER AREA INCLUDED EASTERN COTTONWOOD TREES (POPULUS DELTOIDS BORTR. EX MARSH.) PLANTED INTO FESCUE. THE APEX MODEL WAS CALIBRATED FROM 2002 TO 2005 AND WAS VALIDATED FROM 2006 TO 2008.

SIMULATED RUNOFF DECREASED BY 24% WHEN THE BUFFER WIDTH WAS DOUBLED COMPARED TO LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEASURED BUFFER WIDTH. SIMULATED RUNOFF FROM THE CW WATERSHEDS WAS 11% HIGHER WITH DOUBLE STOCKING DENSITY (RELATIVE TO MEASURED DENSITY) COMPARED TO AGB WATERSHEDS WITH DOUBLE STOCKING DENSITY. WITH HALF STOCKING DENSITY (RELATIVE TO MEASURED DENSITY), THE AGB WATERSHED HAD 18% LOWER RUNOFF COMPARED TO CW. RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY IMPLY THAT ESTABLISHMENT OF AGROFORESTRY BUFFERS ON GRAZED PASTURE WATERSHEDS REDUCE RUNOFF AND SEDIMENT LOSSES COMPARED TO CONTROL WATERSHEDS WITHOUT BUFFERS.","83","1","51","62","SIMULATION MODELING; WATERSHED; STOCKING; PASTURE; EASTERN COTTONWOOD; SEDIMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SURFACE RUNOFF; POLLUTION; AGROFORESTRY","","","","","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-010-9350-7/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10457-010-9350-7","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1007/S10457-010-9350-7","","10.1007/s10457-010-9350-7","1969875840","","0","001-622-064-959-791; 004-771-960-697-150; 005-235-828-092-362; 006-190-003-301-107; 008-380-052-396-94X; 013-962-017-892-957; 019-622-915-734-27X; 021-981-714-885-895; 026-802-370-774-790; 028-802-252-344-012; 031-431-985-525-652; 034-468-599-710-065; 039-075-642-251-226; 054-070-224-919-941; 054-779-623-720-76X; 055-486-051-386-205; 055-488-793-301-441; 056-444-102-079-143; 062-528-990-554-138; 063-488-818-272-529; 064-864-423-263-276; 066-947-210-171-825; 074-364-009-770-32X; 081-088-522-178-170; 082-797-391-654-568; 088-017-310-971-747; 092-375-275-782-901; 092-843-881-158-062; 105-944-246-057-441; 137-129-103-379-099; 143-762-546-959-86X; 146-564-233-748-350; 153-472-582-944-670; 159-491-143-715-990; 161-900-120-826-037; 175-196-769-643-19X; 178-569-929-323-960; 180-269-022-208-11X","18","SANDEEP KUMAR; RANJITH P.

THEY ARE POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT FOR WETLAND BIODIVERSITY BUT, DESPITE THEIR UBIQUITY, INFORMATION ON THEIR BIODIVERSITY AND MANAGEMENT IN THE WIDER COUNTRYSIDE IS SCARCE. WE SURVEYED 175 DITCHES FOR THEIR PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS, SPATIAL CONNECTIVITY, PLANT COMMUNITIES AND AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES IN AN AREA OF INTENSIVELY MANAGED FARMLAND IN OXFORDSHIRE, UK AND COLLECTED INFORMATION ON DITCH MANAGEMENT FROM FARMER INTERVIEWS. WATER DEPTH AND SHADE HAD A SMALL IMPACT ON THE DIVERSITY OF PLANT AND INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES IN DITCHES. INCREASED SHADE OVER THE DITCH CHANNEL RESULTED IN REDUCED TAXONOMIC RICHNESS OF BOTH CHANNEL VEGETATION AND AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES AND CHANNEL VEGETATION COVER WAS LOWER AT SHADED SITES. INVERTEBRATE TAXONOMIC RICHNESS WAS HIGHER WHEN WATER WAS DEEPER. SPATIAL CONNECTIVITY HAD NO DETECTABLE IMPACT ON THE AQUATIC INVERTEBRATE OR PLANT COMMUNITIES FOUND IN DITCHES. THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES WITHIN THE ORDERS EPHEMEROPTERA, PLECOPTERA AND TRICHOPTERA (EPT), WHICH CONTAIN MANY POLLUTION-SENSITIVE SPECIES, DECLINED WITH DECREASING PH OF DITCH WATER. AS TIME SINCE DREDGING INCREASED, THE NUMBER OF EPT FAMILIES INCREASED IN PERMANENT DITCHES BUT DECREASED IN TEMPORARY DITCHES. WHETHER OR NOT A DITCH WAS IN AN AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEME HAD LITTLE IMPACT ON THE REPORTED MANAGEMENT REGIME OR BIODIVERSITY VALUE OF THE DITCH. MEASURES FOR INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF WATER IN DITCHES, BY INCREASING THE WATER DEPTH OR PROMOTING RETENTION OF WATER IN DITCHES, COULD INCREASE THE BIODIVERSITY VALUE OF DITCHES IN AGRICULTURAL LAND. SOME TEMPORARY DITCHES FOR SPECIALISED SPECIES SHOULD BE RETAINED. REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF SHADE OVER NARROW DITCHES BY MANAGING ADJACENT HEDGEROWS IS ALSO LIKELY TO INCREASE THE SPECIES DIVERSITY OF PLANT AND INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE DITCH. WE RECOMMEND THAT TO PRESERVE OR ENHANCE THE BIODIVERSITY VALUE OF DITCHES, AND IMPROVE THEIR ECOSYSTEM SERVICE DELIVERY, MANAGEMENT PRESCRIPTIONS FOR HEDGEROWS ADJACENT TO DITCHES SHOULD DIFFER FROM THOSE AIMED AT HEDGEROWS ONLY.","10","10","E0138306","","BIODIVERSITY; VEGETATION; GEOGRAPHY; DITCH; ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION; PLANT COMMUNITY; SPECIES RICHNESS; AGROFORESTRY; SPECIES DIVERSITY; WETLAND","","AGRICULTURE/METHODS; ANIMALS; BIODIVERSITY; ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION/ADVERSE EFFECTS; INVERTEBRATES/DRUG EFFECTS; PLANTS; UNITED KINGDOM; WATER; WATER POLLUTANTS, CHEMICAL/ADVERSE EFFECTS; WETLANDS","WATER POLLUTANTS, CHEMICAL; WATER","","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26445146 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26445146/ https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0138306 https://paperity.org/p/73983660/enhancing-the-biodiversity-of-ditches-in-intensively-managed-uk-farmland https://core.ac.uk/display/150124009 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PLoSO..1038306S/abstract http://europepmc.org/article/MED/26445146","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0138306","26445146","10.1371/journal.pone.0138306","2141000027","PMC4596843","0","001-457-135-894-766; 001-667-505-805-181; 003-461-880-854-275; 005-769-046-282-205; 007-748-151-849-680; 008-073-690-711-246; 008-524-220-939-553; 013-143-342-453-561; 015-276-662-838-876; 015-825-410-503-104; 016-421-756-148-512; 017-581-076-486-349; 017-991-432-760-300; 018-797-363-505-484; 018-920-871-093-237; 019-234-857-538-507; 022-438-869-235-426; 023-150-755-367-408; 025-990-754-410-325; 030-523-500-067-676; 031-434-972-081-136; 032-494-612-708-485; 032-502-062-020-869; 032-509-462-591-048; 039-270-311-852-944; 039-314-331-841-400; 040-054-642-273-583; 040-532-664-803-091; 042-034-223-767-372; 042-746-580-549-408; 043-900-591-870-482; 046-922-146-668-557; 053-024-791-968-164; 053-509-798-892-145; 062-689-906-867-519; 064-636-600-002-276; 070-861-776-373-714; 073-247-449-875-839; 082-714-080-755-584; 083-000-721-653-361; 084-200-224-780-91X; 085-408-776-824-254; 098-086-187-871-16X; 100-211-964-096-496; 101-656-029-176-741; 106-009-107-218-603; 106-184-521-213-152; 109-802-423-459-241; 122-154-985-613-384; 124-193-767-897-678; 129-692-017-031-224; 130-042-670-727-110; 131-210-994-753-610; 139-002-674-261-62X; 149-219-444-648-167; 157-952-466-995-882; 159-938-497-832-818; 179-402-327-063-059; 179-517-966-221-279; 183-502-124-756-149","11","ROSALIND F.

THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO DESCRIBE AND ILLUSTRATE THE USE OF A NEWLY DEVELOPED FIELD-BASED EVALUATION TOOL FOR RIPARIAN BUFFER ZONES IN AGRICULTURAL CATCHMENTS. THE BUFFER ZONE INVENTORY AND EVALUATION FORM (BZIEF) INCORPORATES CRITERIA-BASED SCORING SYSTEMS DEVELOPED FROM LITERATURE REVIEW, SUBSEQUENT PEER-REVIEW, AND THEN A PILOT FIELD STUDY. USE OF THE BZIEF IS DEMONSTRATED BY COMPARING BUFFER ZONES IN THREE CATCHMENTS ESTABLISHED FOR WATER QUALITY AND HABITAT IMPROVEMENT UNDER THE WATER FRINGE OPTION AGRIENVIRONMENT SCHEME IN ENGLAND IN ORDER TO ASSESS WHETHER THE BUFFERS WERE LIKELY TO PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTAL ENHANCEMENT. RESULTS AMONG THE THREE CATCHMENTS WERE GENERALLY SIMILAR; BUFFER ZONES SCORED HIGHLY FOR THEIR ABUNDANT VEGETATION COVER, LACK OF EROSION, STREAM HABITAT QUALITY, AND SUFFICIENT WIDTH. FURTHERMORE, PREVIOUS GRASSLAND OR ARABLE LAND USE DID NOT SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT BUFFER ZONE RATINGS. HOWEVER, THE BZIEF INDICATED THAT INAPPROPRIATE SOIL CHARACTERISTICS IN ONE CATCHMENT WERE LIKELY TO CONSTRAIN BUFFER ZONE EFFECTIVENESS FOR IMPROVING WATER QUALITY. IN ANOTHER CATCHMENT, POOR RIPARIAN VEGETATION DIVERSITY AND STRUCTURE MAY YIELD INEFFECTIVE HABITAT ENHANCEMENT, ACCORDING TO THE BZIEF. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE BZIEF MIGHT BE A USEFUL TOOL FOR BUFFER ZONE COMPARISON AND MONITORING, EVEN THOUGH MORE WORK IS NEEDED TO TEST AND VALIDATE THE METHOD. FOR EXAMPLE, THE BZIEF COULD BE USED TO TARGET APPROPRIATE LOCATIONS FOR BUFFER ZONES AND IS FLEXIBLE, SO COULD BE ADAPTED FOR DIFFERENT POLICIES, OBJECTIVES AND REGIONS.","32","2","252","267","RIPARIAN ZONE; EROSION; HABITAT; PLANT COVER; RIPARIAN BUFFER; BUFFER ZONE; WATER QUALITY; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; ARABLE LAND","","AGRICULTURE; ECOSYSTEM; ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING/METHODS; POACEAE; QUALITY CONTROL; RIVERS; TREES; WATER MOVEMENTS; WATER POLLUTION/PREVENTION & CONTROL","","","https://research.brighton.ac.uk/en/publications/field-base-evaluation-tool-for-riparian-buffer-zones-in-agricultu https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-003-2913-x https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14753650/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/14753650 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14753650","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1007/S00267-003-2913-X","14753650","10.1007/s00267-003-2913-x","1988763464","","0","010-193-923-056-157; 013-837-754-758-309; 015-342-032-824-51X; 016-327-566-425-434; 024-178-088-841-823; 025-193-868-192-213; 031-308-300-948-57X; 035-093-656-083-327; 037-315-124-217-631; 038-052-133-910-360; 038-659-320-814-260; 042-293-727-219-763; 044-401-317-828-273; 044-686-280-596-043; 049-377-460-200-299; 053-093-567-362-36X; 060-161-134-849-717; 066-343-136-026-197; 066-360-222-781-695; 068-997-932-046-194; 072-045-503-834-551; 072-782-954-705-847; 079-006-018-469-602; 087-369-280-042-754; 088-526-158-902-16X; 090-091-668-943-545; 098-004-631-148-428; 104-230-077-662-702; 108-227-856-010-154; 111-435-647-398-863; 115-642-860-718-878; 116-065-618-368-696; 116-154-736-226-300; 141-101-347-131-583; 169-637-192-822-911; 172-304-497-701-670; 172-729-211-137-618","27","CAROLINE M.

THEREFORE, IDENTIFYING THE LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS THAT CAN MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION RESULTING FROM AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES IS ESSENTIAL TO PRESERVE THE BIODIVERSITY OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND. WE QUANTIFIED SPECIES RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF SMALL MAMMALS IN 13 HEDGEROWS AND 13 ATTACHED FOREST PATCHES. ALTHOUGH ALL THE SPECIES DETECTED IN FOREST PATCHES WERE ALSO FOUND IN HEDGEROWS, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SPECIES DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE SUGGEST THAT NOT ALL SPECIES BENEFIT EQUALLY FROM HEDGEROWS. THE ABUNDANCE OF SMALL MAMMALS OTHER THAN THE EASTERN CHIPMUNK (TAMIAS STRIATUS) INCREASED IN HEDGEROWS LONGER THAN ABOUT 225–250 M, BUT WAS INDEPENDENT OF HEDGEROW'S LENGTH IN HEDGEROWS SMALLER THAN 225–250 M.

THEY ARE AMONG THE MOST THREATENED AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES OF WESTERN EUROPE. INTENSIFICATION OF AGRICULTURE WITH THE CONVERSION OF PERMANENT GRASSLAND INTO PLOUGHED LAND AND THE USE OF NEW MACHINERY LEADS TO THE ENLARGEMENT OF FIELDS AND THE REMOVAL OF HEDGEROWS SURROUNDING THEM. THERE IS A GROWING CONCERN AMONG CONSERVATIONISTS, RURAL MANAGERS AND THE PUBLIC TO MAINTAIN THESE GREENWAYS AS A FRAMEWORK FOR LANDSCAPE SUSTAINABILITY. IN FRANCE, HEDGEROW REMOVAL MAY BE PLANNED WITHIN REALLOTMENT PROGRAMMES THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE LAND OF A MUNICIPALITY. IN THIS PLANNING PROCESS, CRITERIA FOR KEEPING OR CLEARING WOODY ELEMENTS ARE BASED ON AGRONOMIC PROPERTIES OF SOIL, ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF ELEMENTS AND OF THE NETWORK, AND PROPERTY BOUNDARIES. AESTHETIC ASPECTS ARE RARELY ASSESSED. AS RURAL LANDSCAPES ARE SHIFTING FROM AN ALMOST UNIQUE FUNCTION OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION TOWARD A MULTIFUNCTION OF NATURE CONSERVATION, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, AMENITY AND PRODUCTION, THE CONSERVATION OF HEDGEROW NETWORKS BECOMES OF GREATER IMPORTANCE. THE GOAL IS NOW THE PROTECTION OF THESE GREENWAYS TO PROVIDE NOT ONLY ECOLOGICAL BUT ALSO RECREATIONAL AND CULTURAL BENEFITS. IN A CASE STUDY IN BRITTANY, WE TRIED TO LINK THESE DIFFERENT ASPECTS. OUR WORK IS BASED ON INTERVIEWS AND A LANDSCAPE ECOLOGICAL SURVEY. WE FOUND CONTRASTING OPINIONS BETWEEN FARMERS AND NON-FARMERS CONCERNING THE DENSITY OF THE NETWORK. NEVERTHELESS, THE TWO GROUPS AGREE ON THE NECESSITY TO KEEP GREENWAYS AS PART OF THEIR CULTURAL LANDSCAPE. MOST OF THE PEOPLE WERE NOT AWARE OF THE ECOLOGICAL ROLE OF HEDGEROW NETWORKS, AND PERCEIVE THEM ONLY BY THEIR VISUAL PROPERTIES. WE PROPOSED VARIOUS SCENARIOS BASED ON ECOLOGICAL AND AESTHETIC PRINCIPLES, AND DEFINED GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR THE DESIGN OF NEW LANDSCAPES DURING REALLOTMENT PROGRAMMES. THE INTEGRATION OF DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW BY LANDSCAPE PLANNERS IS THE ONLY WAY TO LINK VISUAL VALUES TO PRODUCTIVE OR ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES, AND MUST BE EFFECTIVE IN THE CASE OF THE MANAGEMENT OF GREENWAYS SUCH AS HEDGEROWS.","33","1-3","327","340","RECREATION; CULTURAL LANDSCAPE; AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY; ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; HEDGEROW REMOVAL; AMENITY; SUSTAINABILITY; ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY; LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016920469402026C","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/0169-2046(94)02026-C","","10.1016/0169-2046(94)02026-c","1972278488","","0","009-064-884-569-067; 024-501-736-867-747; 024-639-748-064-02X; 029-105-025-347-654; 040-438-307-576-758; 044-307-523-708-239; 049-055-298-294-941; 057-216-974-134-105; 060-342-609-139-480; 073-991-527-323-833; 089-120-143-077-562; 090-241-745-097-057; 099-275-474-038-647; 110-250-911-763-923; 111-333-657-300-13X; 112-148-110-351-322; 115-818-187-214-915; 122-176-999-824-374; 126-903-252-358-903; 134-475-232-519-759; 150-494-637-604-381; 153-404-848-965-512; 153-542-156-060-937; 165-325-555-425-125; 187-050-769-304-212","100","FRANÇOISE BUREL; JACQUES BAUDRY","LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING","LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING","","LENS",0,"BUREL F, 1995, LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING","BUREL F, 1995, LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING"

ALTHOUGH ENZYME ACTIVITIES AND WATER STABLE AGGREGATES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS MEASURABLE SOIL QUALITY PARAMETERS FOR EARLY RESPONSES TO CHANGES IN SOIL MANAGEMENT, THE LITERATURE LACKS INFORMATION ON THOSE PARAMETERS FOR GRAZING SYSTEMS WITH AGROFORESTRY BUFFERS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE ACTIVITIES OF FLUORESCEIN DIACETATE (FDA) HYDROLASE, DEHYDROGENASE, Β-GLUCOSIDASE AND Β-GLUCOSAMINIDASE, THE PERCENTAGE OF WATER STABLE AGGREGATES (WSA) AND SOIL ORGANIC CARBON AND NITROGEN AS SOIL QUALITY PARAMETERS FOR GRAZED PASTURE AND ROW-CROP SYSTEMS. THE STUDY CONSISTED OF FOUR MANAGEMENT TREATMENTS: GRAZED PASTURE (GP), AGROFORESTRY BUFFER (AGB), GRASS BUFFER (GB) AND ROW-CROP (RC). THE WSA WAS DETERMINED BY WET SIEVING METHOD WHILE THE ENZYME ACTIVITIES WERE COLORIMETRICALLY QUANTIFIED USING A SPECTROPHOTOMETER IN LABORATORY ASSAYS. SOIL ORGANIC CARBON (SOC) AND TOTAL NITROGEN (TN) CONTENTS WERE ALSO DETERMINED. TWO SOIL DEPTHS (0–10 AND 10–20 CM) WERE ANALYZED FOR ALL TREATMENTS. THE ROW-CROP TREATMENT SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO ALL OTHER TREATMENTS FOR Β-GLUCOSIDASE AND Β-GLUCOSAMINIDASE ENZYMES ALONG WITH LOWER WSA. THE DEHYDROGENASE ACTIVITIES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN GP TREATMENT COMPARED TO RC TREATMENT. THE FDA HYDROLASE ACTIVITIES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AMONG TREATMENTS. SURFACE SOIL REVEALED HIGHER ENZYME ACTIVITIES AND HIGHER WSA THAN THE SUB-SURFACE SOIL. THE TREATMENT BY DEPTH INTERACTION WAS SIGNIFICANT FOR Β-GLUCOSIDASE AND Β-GLUCOSAMINIDASE ENZYMES. THE SOIL ORGANIC CARBON AND TOTAL NITROGEN DATA STRONGLY SUPPORTED THE RESULTS OF ENZYME ACTIVITIES AND WSA. IMPLICATIONS CAN BE MADE THAT PERENNIAL VEGETATION ENHANCES ORGANIC MATTER ACCUMULATION IN THE SOIL, HAS MINIMUM DISTURBANCE TO THE SOIL AND WILL HAVE POSITIVE IMPACTS ON THE ECOSYSTEM.","48","2","125","132","ECOSYSTEM; PERENNIAL PLANT; SOIL QUALITY; GRAZING; WATER QUALITY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SOIL CARBON; ORGANIC MATTER; AGROFORESTRY; AGRONOMY; SOIL MANAGEMENT","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139311000771","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.APSOIL.2011.04.004","","10.1016/j.apsoil.2011.04.004","1998295918","","0","000-201-907-509-86X; 002-271-389-418-63X; 004-771-960-697-150; 005-215-659-380-778; 006-083-800-428-238; 008-380-052-396-94X; 013-547-662-323-089; 014-026-509-704-03X; 015-620-073-261-95X; 016-725-382-309-766; 017-494-030-235-928; 019-622-915-734-27X; 019-697-614-617-578; 027-429-199-805-844; 028-106-711-394-010; 028-146-838-004-688; 028-330-817-487-676; 031-017-179-874-053; 036-315-734-250-926; 036-625-376-116-797; 044-214-456-182-827; 044-623-657-378-698; 049-660-923-994-771; 049-972-522-559-229; 054-162-047-302-972; 054-245-802-372-063; 055-486-051-386-205; 056-908-848-757-783; 057-283-555-498-270; 057-798-446-166-229; 062-253-039-022-413; 064-872-788-307-008; 065-234-881-061-065; 066-597-669-362-855; 074-409-624-022-848; 074-623-587-956-103; 075-239-776-800-503; 077-842-859-435-846; 081-347-358-673-391; 083-172-644-867-956; 088-017-310-971-747; 089-267-416-283-668; 092-410-436-114-594; 092-804-670-514-23X; 092-941-160-711-170; 093-233-075-589-296; 096-499-726-729-908; 096-658-417-036-927; 097-162-808-147-613; 098-786-514-202-615; 100-352-856-504-930; 100-679-216-297-456; 114-634-177-859-258; 114-713-454-502-122; 121-177-129-261-350; 128-187-888-119-092; 129-995-958-647-803; 137-649-591-574-609; 138-121-533-037-654; 139-114-598-021-152; 147-428-454-235-823; 149-633-039-918-024; 150-026-070-813-336; 152-157-521-163-436; 159-237-134-366-844; 161-671-403-526-169; 173-208-888-012-406; 181-950-948-397-544; 185-116-269-568-509","54","BODH R.

WHEN THESE SYSTEMIC COMPOUNDS ARE APPLIED TO SEEDS, LOW CONCENTRATIONS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND IN THE NECTAR AND POLLEN OF THE CROP, WHICH ARE THEN COLLECTED AND CONSUMED BY BEES. HERE WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE CURRENT FOCUS ON EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES VIA THE CROP OVERLOOKS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR: THROUGHOUT SPRING AND SUMMER, MIXTURES OF NEONICOTINOIDS ARE ALSO FOUND IN THE POLLEN AND NECTAR OF WILDFLOWERS GROWING IN ARABLE FIELD MARGINS, AT CONCENTRATIONS THAT ARE SOMETIMES EVEN HIGHER THAN THOSE FOUND IN THE CROP. INDEED, THE LARGE MAJORITY (97%) OF NEONICOTINOIDS BROUGHT BACK IN POLLEN TO HONEY BEE HIVES IN ARABLE LANDSCAPES WAS FROM WILDFLOWERS, NOT CROPS. BOTH PREVIOUS AND ONGOING FIELD STUDIES HAVE BEEN BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT EXPOSURE TO NEONICOTINOIDS WOULD OCCUR ONLY DURING THE BLOOMING PERIOD OF FLOWERING CROPS AND THAT IT MAY BE DILUTED BY BEES ALSO FORAGING ON UNTREATED WILDFLOWERS. HERE, WE SHOW THAT EXPOSURE IS LIKELY TO BE HIGHER AND MORE PROLONGED THAN CURRENTLY RECOGNIZED BECAUSE OF WIDESPREAD CONTAMINATION OF WILD PLANTS GROWING NEAR TREATED CROPS.","49","21","12731","12740","CROP; NECTAR; PESTICIDE; NEONICOTINOID; HONEY BEE; POLLEN; PLANT NECTAR; ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE; AGRONOMY; BIOLOGY","","ANABASINE/TOXICITY; ANIMALS; BEES/METABOLISM; BRASSICA RAPA/CHEMISTRY; CROPS, AGRICULTURAL/CHEMISTRY; ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE/ANALYSIS; FLOWERS/CHEMISTRY; HORDEUM/CHEMISTRY; INSECTICIDES/ANALYSIS; PLANT NECTAR/CHEMISTRY; POLLEN/CHEMISTRY; SEEDS/CHEMISTRY; SOIL/CHEMISTRY; TRITICUM/CHEMISTRY","INSECTICIDES; PLANT NECTAR; SOIL; ANABASINE","BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL (BB/K014498/1) UNITED KINGDOM","https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015EnST...4912731B/abstract https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26439915 http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.5b03459 https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.5b03459 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26439915 http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/57496/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26439915/","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1021/ACS.EST.5B03459","26439915","10.1021/acs.est.5b03459","1948629506","","0","000-703-795-047-209; 002-363-145-800-97X; 003-709-929-067-376; 004-331-144-071-054; 006-045-872-975-671; 006-873-793-603-769; 008-370-950-529-303; 009-155-014-918-79X; 011-485-642-832-317; 011-594-952-070-795; 012-395-928-592-846; 016-037-383-642-107; 017-243-000-537-232; 018-293-771-552-395; 018-728-558-339-819; 024-204-497-979-352; 025-872-520-407-089; 028-403-131-717-566; 028-755-857-787-220; 031-862-039-493-29X; 033-459-762-518-620; 035-053-831-571-832; 037-142-583-684-543; 040-974-261-953-640; 043-262-767-141-352; 046-965-254-832-764; 051-623-164-446-502; 055-592-500-673-007; 056-892-630-404-500; 062-232-690-176-857; 063-903-729-213-426; 076-961-298-168-965; 079-543-425-039-89X; 080-264-084-827-372; 083-515-091-865-45X; 090-723-396-427-514; 090-981-119-231-267; 091-872-139-039-313; 095-147-409-690-266; 109-059-019-425-105; 114-793-580-658-606; 128-980-820-958-694; 129-921-120-667-526; 143-336-650-577-384; 147-644-604-994-187; 164-543-304-152-512","223","CRISTINA BOTÍAS; ARTHUR DAVID; JULIA HORWOOD; ALAA ABDUL-SADA; ELIZABETH NICHOLLS; ELIZABETH M.

TO SAFEGUARD THIS CONSERVATION FUNCTION, INSIGHT IN THE BASIC ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES OF HEDGEROW PLANT COMMUNITIES IS NEEDED. THE VEGETATION COMPOSITION OF 511 INDIVIDUAL HEDGEROWS SITUATED WITHIN AN ANCIENT HEDGEROW NETWORK LANDSCAPE IN FLANDERS, BELGIUM WAS RECORDED, IN COMBINATION WITH A WIDE RANGE OF EXPLANATORY VARIABLES, INCLUDING A SELECTION OF SPATIAL VARIABLES. NON-PARAMETRIC STATISTICS IN COMBINATION WITH MULTIVARIATE DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES WERE USED TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF INDIVIDUAL EXPLANATORY VARIABLES. NEXT, VARIABLES WERE GROUPED IN FIVE DISTINCT SUBSETS AND THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THESE VARIABLE GROUPS WAS ASSESSED BY TWO RELATED VARIATION PARTITIONING TECHNIQUES, PARTIAL REGRESSION AND PARTIAL CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT EXPLICITLY THE EXISTENCE OF INTERCORRELATIONS BETWEEN VARIABLES OF DIFFERENT FACTOR GROUPS. MOST EXPLANATORY VARIABLES AFFECTED SIGNIFICANTLY HEDGEROW SPECIES RICHNESS AND COMPOSITION. MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT, BESIDES ADJACENT LAND USE, HEDGEROW MANAGEMENT, SOIL CONDITIONS, HEDGEROW TYPE AND ORIGIN, THE ROLE OF OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS HEDGE DIMENSIONS, INTACTNESS, ETC., COULD CERTAINLY NOT BE NEGLECTED. FURTHERMORE, BOTH METHODS REVEALED THE SAME OVERALL RANKING OF THE FIVE DISTINCT FACTOR GROUPS.

PERIODIC HARVESTS OF ABOVE GROUND VEGETATION WERE COMBINED WITH ROOT CORES TO ESTIMATE THE TOTAL STANDING BIOMASS AND THE POOL OF P IN PLANT TISSUE IN THREE VEGETATIVE COVER TYPES DOMINATED BY EITHER SWITCHGRASS (PANICUM VIRGATUM L.), AN ALFALFA (MEDICAGO SATIVA L.)-SMOOTH BROMEGRASS (BROMIS INERMIS LEYSS) MIX, OR A FAST GROWING SUPERIOR COTTONWOOD (POPULUS DELTOIDS BARTR., CLONE 42-7). AN EXISTING STAND OF SMOOTH BROME SERVED AS THE SINGLE SPECIES CONTROL. STANDING BIOMASS INCREASED IN ALL THREE COVER TYPES DURING THE 4 YEARS OF STUDY, WITH THE GREATEST INCREASES OBSERVED IN THE COTTONWOOD (2345 G M−2) AND SWITCHGRASS (1818 G M−2).

IN THE SOUTH-WESTERN FRANCE, THE EVOLUTION OF AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES OCCURS IN TWO OPPOSITE WAYS. ON ONE HAND, THE INTENSIFICATION OF AGRICULTURE LEADS TO SIMPLIFY THE LANDSCAPE BY HEDGEROWS REMOVAL, GRASSLANDS PLOUGHING AND DRAINAGE FOR CORN CULTIVATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE DECREASING NUMBERS OF CATTLE AND SHEEP CONDUCT THE LESS FERTILE PARTS OF THE TERRITORY TO EVOLVE INTO FALLOW. THESE TWO PROCESSES ARE CLOSELY LINKED ON A SAME TERRITORY AND IMPORTANT INTERACTIONS EXIST BETWEEN INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL AREAS AND SEMI-NATURAL COMMUNITIES. TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE INTERACTIONS AND THEIR ROLE IN ECOLOGICAL STABILITY OF LANDSCAPES, WE USE PASSERINE BIRD COMMUNITIES AS AN ECOLOGICAL INDICATOR. WE MODELIZED THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BIRDS AND LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE FROM 256 RELEVES. EACH RELEVE INCLUDES A BIRD COUNT POINT OF 20 MN AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE LANDSCAPE FEATURE ON THE SURROUNDING 6.25 HA. AN ORDINATION OF THE RELEVES ALONG THE MAIN ECOLOGICAL GRADIENTS WAS REALIZED USING CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS. THEN, THESE ORDINATIONS WHERE RELATED TO THE LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE WITH STEPWISE AND MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS. THE RATE OF WOODY AREA, THE HEDGEROW NETWORK COMPLEXITY AND THE RATE OF FALLOW LAND ARE THE MAIN ECOLOGICAL GRADIENTS. WE HAVE USED THIS MODEL TO MEASURE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CHANGES INDUCED ON LANDSCAPE BY A RANGE OF MANAGEMENT PRACTICES DIFFERING IN INTENSITY. TO ACHIEVE THIS AIM WE COMPARE THE DISPLACEMENT OF 116 RELEVES ALONG THE ECOLOGICAL GRADIENTS BETWEEN 1983 AND 1988. THE CHANGES OCCURRING BOTH IN BIRD COMPOSITION AND LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE REVEAL THE ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF THE DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (HEDGEROW REMOVAL, DRAINAGE, PLOUGHING, DECREASING GRAZING PRESSURE).

WINTER IS A SEASON OF HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF BIRDS AND HUNTING PRESSURE BUT WOODCOCK PRECISE HABITAT REQUIREMENTS ARE POORLY KNOWN. IT IS CRUCIAL TO ASSESS THREATS AND TO DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OPTIONS FOR THE CONSERVATION OF WOODCOCK POPULATIONS. DURING THREE CONSECUTIVE WINTERS, WE MONITORED 65 INDIVIDUAL WOODCOCKS FITTED WITH RADIO-TAGS IN BRITTANY, FRANCE. HABITAT SELECTION WAS ANALYSED USING GIS AND COMPOSITIONAL ANALYSIS, IN RELATION TO VEGETATION TYPES, SOIL VARIABLES (HUMUS TYPES) AND THE ABUNDANCE OF THEIR MAIN PREY (EARTHWORMS). WOODCOCKS USED DIFFERENT HABITATS DIURNALLY AND NOCTURNALLY, GENERALLY PREFERRING AREAS WITH HIGH EARTHWORM BIOMASS. DIURNAL HABITAT SELECTION IN FORESTS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HUMUS TYPE (PREFERENCE FOR MULLS, RICH IN EARTHWORMS) AND DENSE SHRUB STRATA (BETTER PROTECTION). HEDGES WITH A HIGH DENSITY OF TREES AND SHRUB WERE ALSO IMPORTANT HABITAT. AT NIGHT, GRAZED MEADOWS WERE THE PREFERRED HABITAT, CONTAINING FIVE TIMES HIGHER BIOMASS OF EARTHWORMS COMPARED TO CULTIVATED FIELDS. SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF POPULATIONS REQUIRES PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF HABITATS THAT INCORPORATES FOOD AND COVER.

DECLINING POPULATIONS OF UK GRASSLAND FLORA AND FAUNA HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO INTENSIFICATION OF AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN CUTTING, FERTILIZER, GRAZING AND DRAINAGE REGIMES. WE AIMED TO DEVELOP FIELD MARGIN MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT COULD REVERSE DECLINES IN INTENSIVELY MANAGED GRASSLAND BIODIVERSITY THAT WOULD HAVE APPLICATION IN THE UK AND EUROPE. HERE WE FOCUS ON ONE ASPECT OF GRASSLAND BIODIVERSITY, THE BEETLES. 2. IN FOUR INTENSIVELY MANAGED LIVESTOCK FARMS IN SOUTH-WEST ENGLAND, 10-M WIDE FIELD MARGINS IN EXISTING GRASSLANDS WERE MANAGED TO CREATE SEVEN TREATMENTS OF INCREASING SWARD ARCHITECTURAL COMPLEXITY. THIS WAS ACHIEVED THROUGH COMBINATIONS OF INORGANIC (NPK) FERTILIZER, CATTLE GRAZING, AND TIMING AND HEIGHT OF CUTTING. TO EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL INFLUENCE OF COMPLEXITY ON FAUNAL DIVERSITY, BEETLES WERE IDENTIFIED TO SPECIES LEVEL FROM SUCTION SAMPLES TAKEN BETWEEN 2003 AND 2005, AND THEIR ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE WAS RELATED TO MARGIN MANAGEMENT, FLORAL ASSEMBLAGES AND SWARD ARCHITECTURE. 3. BEETLE ABUNDANCE, AND SPECIES RICHNESS AND EVENNESS WERE INFLUENCED BY MARGIN MANAGEMENT TREATMENT AND ITS INTERACTION WITH YEAR. CORRELATIONS WITH SWARD ARCHITECTURE AND THE PERCENTAGE COVER OF DOMINANT FORBS AND GRASSES WERE ALSO FOUND. FUNCTIONAL GROUPS OF THE BEETLES SHOWED DIFFERENT RESPONSES TO THE MANAGEMENT TREATMENTS. IN PARTICULAR, HIGHER PROPORTIONAL ABUNDANCES OF SEED/FLOWER-FEEDING GUILDS WERE FOUND IN TREATMENTS NOT RECEIVING NPK FERTILIZER. 4. THE ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE WAS SHOWN TO RESPOND TO MARGIN MANAGEMENT TREATMENTS, SWARD ARCHITECTURE AND THE PERCENTAGE COVER OF DOMINANT FORBS AND GRASSES. THE MOST EXTENSIVELY MANAGED TREATMENTS WERE CHARACTERIZED BY DISTINCT SUCCESSIONAL TRAJECTORIES FROM THE CONTROL TREATMENT. 5. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. THIS STUDY PROVIDES MANAGEMENT OPTIONS SUITABLE FOR USE WITHIN AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES INTENDED TO IMPROVE FAUNAL DIVERSITY ASSOCIATED WITH INTENSIVELY MANAGED LOWLAND GRASSLANDS. FIELD MARGINS RECEIVING EITHER NO MANAGEMENT OR A SINGLE JULY SILAGE CUT WERE SHOWN TO SUPPORT GREATER ABUNDANCES AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF BEETLES, ALTHOUGH SUBTLER MODIFICATIONS OF CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT MAY ALSO BE BENEFICIAL, FOR EXAMPLE THE ABSENCE OF NPK FERTILIZER WHILE MAINTAINING GRAZING AND SILAGE CUTTING SYSTEMS.","44","1","60","69","FAUNA; SPECIES EVENNESS; BIODIVERSITY; FORB; GRASSLAND; GRAZING; SPECIES RICHNESS; AGROFORESTRY; ABUNDANCE (ECOLOGY); BIOLOGY","","","","","https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01258.x https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01258.x https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01258.x/abstract http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/9399/ http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01258.x/full https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01258.x https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/162122168.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1365-2664.2006.01258.X","","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01258.x","1588048306","","0","003-251-732-418-644; 007-827-850-871-938; 014-162-369-478-70X; 014-591-903-776-324; 016-421-756-148-512; 019-750-716-538-504; 030-453-266-652-445; 032-192-970-524-05X; 056-585-869-238-25X; 056-789-845-462-569; 058-743-931-737-265; 059-863-891-880-237; 065-161-518-246-802; 065-565-421-487-993; 071-363-274-178-219; 073-010-346-426-592; 076-425-702-964-164; 078-068-143-214-104; 082-407-432-481-039; 084-454-852-806-033; 089-253-154-997-777; 092-387-691-527-318; 097-940-408-467-683; 101-987-905-557-98X; 104-461-793-224-947; 110-673-327-117-273; 117-345-687-903-78X; 119-085-349-431-446; 127-029-369-930-692; 149-796-121-127-05X; 150-451-331-765-852; 179-939-285-820-217","80","BEN A.

OUR FIVE EDGES SPANNED GRASSY TO WOODED HABITATS. LINEAR HABITATS WERE INTENSIVELY SAMPLED FOR VASCULAR PLANTS IN 2003 AND SMALL MAMMAL COMMUNITIES FROM 2003 TO 2007. VEGETATION AND TOTAL ABUNDANCE OF SMALL MAMMAL SPECIES AMONG THREE TYPES OF HEDGEROWS WERE SIMILAR AND POPULATION CHANGES FOLLOWED THOSE WITHIN NEARBY APPLE ORCHARDS. SPECIES RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY OF SMALL MAMMALS, HOWEVER, WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN HEDGEROWS THAN ORCHARDS. FEWER MAMMALS OCCUPIED HEDGEROWS WITH HIGH VOLUMES OF HERB AND SHRUB BIOMASS, BUT RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY OF MAMMALS DID INCREASE WITH SHRUB VOLUME. ALL SEVEN SPECIES OF SMALL MAMMALS WERE REPRESENTED IN THE HEDGEROW COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING TWO SPECIES AT RISK: THE GREAT BASIN POCKET MOUSE PEROGNATHUS PARVUS AND THE WESTERN HARVEST MOUSE ( REITHRODONTOMYS MEGALOTIS ).

BOTANICAL DIVERSITY IN 117 HEDGE-BOTTOMS ON TWO NEIGHBOURING FARMS IN YATESBURY, WILTSHIRE, UK, WERE STUDIED IN RELATION TO BOUNDARY STRUCTURE, HEDGE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ADJACENT FEATURES ON THE FARM TO WHICH THEY BELONG. THE FARMS DIFFERED WITH REGARD TO FIELD MARGIN AND HEDGE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, BUT SOIL TYPE AND CROPPING PATTERNS WERE VERY SIMILAR. ATTENTION WAS ALSO PAID TO EFFECTS OF SOWN GRASS STRIPS, COPPICING AND GAPPING-UP OF HEDGES AND DIFFERENT APPROACHES TOWARDS FIELD MARGIN MANAGEMENT. RESULTS INDICATED THAT THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN WOODY SPECIES RICHNESS BETWEEN THE TWO FARMS, WITH HEDGES OF SIMILAR COMPOSITION. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER HERBACEOUS SPECIES DIVERSITY ON THE FARM WITH GRASS STRIPS. MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES INDICATED THAT COMMUNITY DIFFERENCES WERE PRESENT, WITH A NUMBER OF ANNUAL AND BIENNIAL PLANT SPECIES PREDOMINATING ON THE FARM WITHOUT GRASS MARGINS. PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS (PCA), REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS (RDA) WITH FORWARD SELECTION AND ASSOCIATED MONTE-CARLO PERMUTATION TESTS, AND STEPWISE LINEAR REGRESSION SHOWED THE FOLLOWING. (1) SOWN GRASS AND/OR WILDFLOWER STRIPS ADJACENT TO THE HEDGE-BOTTOM HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON SPECIES RICHNESS OF THE HEDGE-BOTTOM VEGETATION. THEY ALSO REDUCE THE ABUNDANCE IN THE HEDGE-BOTTOM OF ANISANTHA STERILIS, GALIUM APARINE, POA TRIVIALIS AND URTICA DIOICA, ALL FOUR CONSIDERED TO BE PERNICIOUS WEED SPECIES. (2) COPPICING IN COMBINATION WITH GAPPING-UP OF HEDGES INCREASES SPECIES RICHNESS OF THE HEDGE-BOTTOM VEGETATION AND HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON FLORAL DIVERSITY IN THE LANDSCAPE.

THE CREATION AND SYMPATHETIC MANAGEMENT OF EDGES COULD IMPROVE ABUNDANCE, DIVERSITY, AND FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION OF FARMLAND COMMUNITIES. MOREOVER, MANY SPECIES OF ARTHROPODS INHABITING THESE HABITATS ARE NATURAL ENEMIES OF CROP PESTS AND COULD PLAY A VALUABLE ROLE IN BIOLOGICAL CONTROL. THE AIM OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE RESPONSE OF GROUND BEETLE ASSEMBLAGES TO DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT REGIMES IN THE RICE FIELD BANKS OF AN INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL AREA OF NORTHERN ITALY. BETWEEN MAY AND NOVEMBER 2010, WE COLLECTED CARABIDS IN 13 PADDY BANKS (5 UNCUT, 4 MOWN TWICE, 4 CUT MONTHLY DURING JUNE–SEPTEMBER) BY MEANS OF PITFALL TRAPS. FREQUENT CUTTING OPERATIONS FAVOURED ASSEMBLAGES DOMINATED BY GENERALIST, MOBILE SPECIES, WHILE MORE SPECIALIZED GROUND BEETLES, SUCH AS PREDATORY AND SHORT-WINGED ONES, WERE ASSOCIATED WITH AN ABSENCE OR LOW LEVELS OF HUMAN DISTURBANCE. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY MANAGED BANKS COULD HELP TO AMELIORATE THE PERSISTENCE OF SPECIES WITH POOR DISPERSAL ABILITY AND PREDATOR POPULATIONS.

CRUCIAL TO ACHIEVING THIS IS IDENTIFYING MANAGEMENT OPTIONS THAT ARE PRACTICAL AND BENEFICIAL TO BIODIVERSITY, AND UNDERSTANDING THE INFLUENCE OF THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE. WE USED DATA ON ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF FARMLAND MACRO-MOTHS, MANY OF WHICH ARE DECLINING, AND TRAIT-BASED ANALYSES ON THEIR FEEDING GUILD, MOBILITY AND CONSERVATION STATUS, TO EXPLORE LOCAL- AND LANDSCAPE-SCALE EFFECTS OF TWO FARMLAND FEATURES (EXTENDED-WIDTH FIELD MARGINS AND HEDGEROW TREES) AND SURROUNDING FARMLAND INTENSIFICATION. MACRO-MOTHS WERE LIGHT TRAPPED AT 48 FIXED SITES ON 16 FARMS, OVER 4 YEARS, WITHIN A 1200-KM2 AREA OF LOWLAND UK FARMLAND. SITES BELONGED TO ONE OF FOUR EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS THAT DIFFERED IN THEIR COMBINATIONS OF HEDGEROW TREE PRESENCE AND FIELD MARGIN WIDTH. HEDGEROW TREES AND EXTENDED-WIDTH FIELD MARGINS LOCALLY INCREASED SPECIES RICHNESS, BUT NOT ABUNDANCE, OF MACRO-MOTHS, IRRESPECTIVE OF EACH OTHER'S PRESENCE. OVERALL, SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE WERE NOT AFFECTED BY AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION, AS MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT OF ARABLE LAND IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE. SEDENTARY MOTHS SHOWED DOUBLE THE SPECIES RICHNESS, BUT WERE HALF AS ABUNDANT AS MOBILE MOTHS. BOTH GROUPS RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO EXTENDED-WIDTH MARGIN AND HEDGEROW TREE PRESENCE. THE EFFECT OF HEDGEROW TREES WAS PARTICULARLY STRONG FOR SHRUB- AND/OR TREE-FEEDING SPECIES. ANALYSES BASED ON THE CONSERVATION STATUS OF MOTHS DEMONSTRATED THAT AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION LOWERED THE SPECIES RICHNESS OF NATIONALLY SEVERELY DECLINING UK BIODIVERSITY ACTION PLAN PRIORITY SPECIES AND THE ABUNDANCE OF BOTH NATIONALLY MODERATELY DECLINING AND PRIORITY SPECIES. THESE EFFECTS WERE MOST PRONOUNCED AT THE 0·8-KM RADIUS SCALE. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE PRESENCE OF EXTENDED-WIDTH FIELD MARGINS AND HEDGEROW TREES, POSSIBLY PROMOTED BY AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES TARGETING THEIR IMPLEMENTATION AT RELATIVELY SMALL SPATIAL SCALES (0·8 KM), MAY HELP MITIGATE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION ON MACRO-MOTHS.

LINEAR LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS) ARE A POPULAR CONSERVATION STRATEGY TO COUNTERACT FRAGMENTATION EFFECTS. GRASSY FIELD MARGINS (GFMS) HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED THROUGHOUT EUROPE AS PART OF AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL SCHEMES. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THESE MEASURES IS TO PROTECT WATER QUALITY, BUT IT IS SUGGESTED BIODIVERSITY MAY BENEFIT VIA A CORRIDOR FUNCTION. BEING SET UP ALONG WATERCOURSES, GFMS MAY SPONTANEOUSLY FORM A COHERENT NETWORK OF CORRIDORS IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES.

MANY HERBIVOROUS SPECIES ARE CROP PESTS, WHILE PREDATORY INSECTS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ACT AS BIOLOGICAL CONTROLS AGAINST PESTS. OVERALL INSECT DIVERSITY HAS DECLINED AS A RESULT OF INTENSIFIED AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. RIPARIAN BUFFERS MAY SUPPORT INSECT POPULATIONS IN INTENSIVELY CULTIVATED AREAS, BUT THEIR ACTUAL IMPACT ON THE BALANCE BETWEEN HARMFUL PESTS AND BENEFICIAL PREDATORS IS NOT KNOWN. IT CAN BE POSTULATED THAT THIS IMPACT MAY VARY DEPENDING ON THE CHARACTERISTICS AND LOCATION OF THE RIPARIAN BUFFER ITSELF. WE INVESTIGATED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC ATTRIBUTES OF AGRICULTURAL RIPARIAN BUFFERS ADJOINING CROP FIELDS AND WATERCOURSES CAN EXPLAIN THE SPECIES COMPOSITION OF HEMIPTERAN ASSEMBLAGES. IN PARTICULAR, WE WERE INTERESTED IN THE ABUNDANCES OF SPECIES BELONGING TO THE GENUS NABIS (GENERALIST PREDATORS) AND RECOGNIZED AND POTENTIAL PESTS OF CEREAL CROPS. RIPARIAN BUFFER WIDTH AND THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF WOODY PLANTS WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH HEMIPTERAN SPECIES TURNOVER AMONG RIPARIAN BUFFERS.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE FATE OF NO3 IN SHALLOW GROUNDWATER MOVING ALONG A LATERAL FLOWPATH FROM A GRASS SEED CROPPING SYSTEM THROUGH AN UNDISTURBED MIXED-SPECIES HERBACEOUS RIPARIAN AREA. SOIL A (30-45 CM) AND C HORIZON (135-150 CM) NO3, DISSOLVED OXYGEN, AND NITROUS OXIDE CONCENTRATIONS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE CROPPING SYSTEM THAN THE ADJACENT RIPARIAN AREA. NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS IN BOTH HORIZONS OF THE RIPARIAN SOIL WERE CONSISTENTLY AT OR BELOW 0.05 MG N L(-1) WHILE CROPPING SYSTEM CONCENTRATIONS RANGED FROM 1 TO 12 MG N L(-1). CHLORIDE DATA SUGGESTED THAT NO3 DILUTION OCCURRED FROM RECHARGE BY PRECIPITATION. HOWEVER, A SHARP DECREASE IN NO3/CL RATIOS AS WATER MOVED INTO THE RIPARIAN AREA INDICATED THAT ADDITIONAL DILUTION OF NO3 CONCENTRATIONS WAS UNLIKELY. RIPARIAN AREA A HORIZON SOIL WATER HAD HIGHER DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON THAN THE CROPPING SYSTEM AND WHEN THE RIPARIAN SOIL BECAME SATURATED, AVAILABLE ELECTRON ACCEPTORS (O2, NO3) WERE RAPIDLY REDUCED. DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE RIPARIAN AREA THAN THE CROPPING SYSTEM FOR BOTH HORIZONS INDICATING HIGH BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY. CARBON LIMITATION IN THE CROPPING SYSTEM MAY HAVE LED TO MICROBIAL RESPIRATION USING PRIMARILY O2 AND TO A LESSER DEGREE NO3.

TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT AGROFORESTRY BUFFERS REDUCE RUNOFF BY INCREASED INFILTRATION, WATER USE, AND WATER STORAGE; PROFILE WATER CONTENT AND SOIL WATER INFILTRATION WERE MEASURED FOR A PUTNAM SOIL (FINE, SMECTITIC, MESIC VERTIC ALBAQUALF). THE WATERSHED WAS UNDER NO-TILL MANAGEMENT WITH A CORN (ZEA MAYS L.)-SOYBEAN (GLYCINE MAX L.) ROTATION SINCE 1991. AGROFORESTRY BUFFER STRIPS, 4.5 M WIDE AND 36.5 M APART, WERE PLANTED WITH REDTOP (AGROSTIS GIGANTEA ROTH), BROME (BROMUS SPP.), AND BIRDSFOOT TREFOIL (LOTUS CORNICULATUS L.). PIN OAK (QUERCUS PALUSTRIS MUENCHH.), SWAMP WHITE OAK (Q. BICOLOR WILLD.) AND BUR OAK (Q. MACROCARPA MICHX.) TREES WERE PLANTED AT 3-M INTERVALS IN THE CENTER OF THE AGROFORESTRY BUFFERS IN 1997. PONDED WATER INFILTRATION WAS MEASURED IN AGROFORESTRY AND GRASS BUFFERS AND ROW CROP AREAS. WATER CONTENT IN AGROFORESTRY AND ROW CROP AREAS AT 5, 10, 20, AND 40 CM DEPTHS WERE MEASURED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. QUASI-STEADY INFILTRATION RATES WERE NOT DIFFERENT (P > 0.05) AMONG THE TREATMENTS. AGROFORESTRY HAD LOWER SOIL WATER CONTENT THAN ROW CROP AREAS (P < 0.05) DURING THE GROWING SEASON. HIGHER WATER CONTENT AFTER THE PRINCIPAL RECHARGE EVENT IN THE AGROFORESTRY TREATMENT WAS ATTRIBUTED TO BETTER INFILTRATION THROUGH THE ROOT SYSTEM. RESULTS SHOW THAT AGROFORESTRY BUFFER STRIPS REDUCE SOIL WATER CONTENT DURING CRITICAL TIMES SUCH AS FALLOW PERIODS, AND INCREASE WATER INFILTRATION AND WATER STORAGE.

IMPROVING HABITAT FOR WHITETHROATS COULD HAVE BOTH AGRONOMIC AND WIDER CONSERVATION BENEFITS, AND THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION THAT ACCOMMODATES FARMERS' CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC INCENTIVES COULD BENEFIT BOTH FARMERS AND WILDLIFE.","62","4","329","341","AGRICULTURE; WILDLIFE CONSERVATION; VEGETATION; HABITAT; GEOGRAPHY; CULTURAL ECOLOGY; INCENTIVE; WILDLIFE; ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION; AGROFORESTRY; QUESTIONNAIRE","","AGRICULTURE; ANIMALS; ATTITUDE; CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES; CULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS; ECOSYSTEM; FEMALE; HUMANS; MALE; POPULATION DYNAMICS; PUBLIC OPINION; SONGBIRDS","","","http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/11505761 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479701904566 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11505761 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479701904566","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1006/JEMA.2001.0456","11505761","10.1006/jema.2001.0456","2080585310","","0","002-234-862-186-238; 002-481-178-498-479; 005-937-930-073-754; 008-821-738-651-977; 017-945-902-539-129; 019-596-931-824-076; 022-070-333-305-083; 030-831-977-852-027; 031-706-636-786-651; 032-245-730-539-873; 040-438-307-576-758; 044-722-313-510-441; 047-711-433-977-172; 052-951-584-268-481; 053-551-700-281-485; 056-621-864-838-091; 065-742-718-032-978; 065-846-246-970-603; 068-669-359-350-27X; 073-991-527-323-833; 084-744-111-694-770; 087-186-786-234-321; 094-746-201-098-704; 106-631-772-110-395; 110-766-047-364-379; 120-514-812-606-235; 150-494-637-604-381; 151-368-087-827-60X; 171-352-683-438-394; 174-706-848-200-347; 191-271-087-756-725","8","C.

SPECIFICALLY, WE EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF ROTATIONALLY AND CONTINUOUSLY GRAZED PASTURES AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIPS ON WATER CHEMISTRY, PHYSICAL HABITAT, BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATES, AND FISH AS INDICATORS OF STREAM QUALITY. WE COLLECTED DATA AT 17 SITES UNDER DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF GRAZING AND RIPARIAN MANAGEMENT, USING A LONGITUDINAL DESIGN ON THREE STREAMS AND A PAIRED WATERSHED DESIGN ON TWO OTHERS. CONTINUOUS AND ROTATIONAL GRAZING WERE COMPARED ALONG ONE LONGITUDINAL STUDY STREAM AND AT THE PAIRED WATERSHED. RIPARIAN BUFFER MANAGEMENT, FENCED TREES (WOOD BUFFER), FENCED GRASS, AND UNFENCED ROTATIONALLY GRAZED AREAS WERE THE FOCUS ALONG THE TWO REMAINING LONGITUDINAL STREAMS. PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS (PCA) OF WATER CHEMISTRY, PHYSICAL HABITAT, AND BIOTIC DATA INDICATED A LOCAL MANAGEMENT EFFECT. THE ORDINATIONS SEPARATED CONTINUOUS GRAZING FROM SITES WITH ROTATIONAL GRAZING AND SITES WITH WOOD BUFFERS FROM THOSE WITH GRASS BUFFERS OR ROTATIONALLY GRAZED AREAS. FECAL COLIFORM AND TURBIDITY WERE CONSISTENTLY HIGHER AT CONTINUOUSLY GRAZED THAN ROTATIONALLY GRAZED SITES. PERCENT FINES IN THE STREAMBED WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AT SITES WITH WOOD BUFFERS THAN GRASS AND ROTATIONALLY GRAZED AREAS, AND CANOPY COVER WAS SIMILAR AT SITES WITH WOOD AND GRASS BUFFERS. BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATE METRICS WERE SIGNIFICANT BUT WERE NOT CONSISTENT ACROSS GRAZING AND RIPARIAN BUFFER MANAGEMENT TYPES. FISH DENSITY AND ABUNDANCE WERE RELATED TO RIPARIAN BUFFER TYPE, RATHER THAN GRAZING PRACTICES. OUR STUDY HAS POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR STREAM RESTORATION PROGRAMS IN THE MIDWESTERN UNITED STATES.

THEREFORE, MODIFYING EDGE STRUCTURE MAY BE A WAY TO INFLUENCE EMIGRATION RATES, MAKING IT A USEFUL TOOL FOR CONSERVATION.","70","5","840","852","HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; REGAL FRITILLARY; DANAUS; BUTTERFLY; SPEYERIA; NYMPHALIDAE; GENERALIST AND SPECIALIST SPECIES","","","","","https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.0021-8790.2001.00546.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.0021-8790.2001.00546.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.0021-8790.2001.00546.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.0021-8790.2001.00546.x/full https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.0021-8790.2001.00546.x/full?scrollTo=references","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1046/J.0021-8790.2001.00546.X","","10.1046/j.0021-8790.2001.00546.x","1535841963","","0","000-271-857-070-759; 007-351-842-611-246; 009-812-617-939-431; 015-218-134-012-477; 022-053-523-518-499; 022-440-670-281-663; 025-541-387-485-048; 035-010-410-713-572; 037-060-768-711-537; 038-591-972-424-171; 043-930-938-740-351; 049-672-924-935-368; 057-490-943-271-475; 057-524-883-211-51X; 058-039-935-485-908; 067-277-473-537-389; 077-518-596-975-597; 078-517-244-526-52X; 081-999-833-456-550; 087-226-670-725-181; 095-104-916-898-838; 095-219-668-939-329; 095-522-959-685-498; 095-730-453-974-686; 102-078-797-361-055; 104-509-449-072-200; 109-335-442-828-436; 110-055-869-277-580; 145-112-646-303-735; 146-977-228-707-912; 149-107-018-154-280; 153-573-077-211-153; 159-992-062-101-765; 183-353-234-599-811; 190-059-152-207-526; 198-555-686-356-757","227","LESLIE RIES; DIANE M.

AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INNOVATION IS OFFERED BY THE GROWING SUCCESS OF CHIP-FED BOILERS, SINCE THE PRODUCTION OF CHIPS IS SIMPLER THAN THAT OF LOGS AND HAS A HIGHER POTENTIAL FOR COST REDUCTION. WITHIN THIS CONTEXT, A STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN ITALY WITH THE GOALS OF: (A) DESIGNING THREE ALTERNATIVE CHIP HARVESTING METHODS FOR BUFFER STRIPS, (B) FIELD-TESTING THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH ALTERNATIVE, AND (C) DEVELOPING A MODEL FOR ESTIMATING THE COST OF THESE METHODS UNDER VARYING OPERATIONAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE THREE HARVESTING METHODS REFLECTED DIFFERENT MECHANIZATION LEVELS, WITH ESCALATING INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS. OVERALL, THE STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT FREQUENT MAINTENANCE OF YOUNG, SINGLE ROW BUFFER STRIPS GENERATES PROFITS ONLY WHEN THOROUGHLY MECHANIZED. USING A DEDICATED FELLER-BUNCHER, A FRONT-END LOADER FOR EXTRACTION AND AN INDUSTRIAL TRUCK-MOUNTED CHIPPER BROUGHT THE DELIVERED COST BELOW THE 14 €/M3 LOOSE CHIPS (APPROXIMATELY 4 €/GJ) PRESENTLY PAID BY THE DISTRICT HEATING STATIONS.

INCREASED INTENSIFICATION IN AGRICULTURAL GRASSLANDS HAS LED TO WELL-DOCUMENTED DECLINES IN THE ASSOCIATED FLORA. MANIPULATION OF FIELD MARGINS FOR BIODIVERSITY ENHANCEMENT IN ARABLE SYSTEMS HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY INVESTIGATED. HOWEVER, THERE IS A PAUCITY OF CORRESPONDING LONG-TERM RESEARCH WITHIN INTENSIVELY MANAGED GRASSLANDS. 2. WE INVESTIGATED A COMBINATION OF ESTABLISHMENT AND MANAGEMENT METHODS TO ENHANCE BOTANICAL DIVERSITY OF NEWLY ESTABLISHED FIELD MARGINS IN INTENSIVELY MANAGED GRASSLANDS. THREE METHODS OF FIELD MARGIN ESTABLISHMENT WERE INVESTIGATED INCLUDING FENCING, NATURAL REGENERATION BY ROTAVATION, OR SEEDING WITH A WILDFLOWER MIXTURE. SUBSEQUENT SWARD MANAGEMENT BY EITHER GRAZING OR MOWING WAS TESTED AT THREE MARGIN WIDTHS. SUCCESS OF ESTABLISHMENT WAS ADDRESSED IN TERMS OF PERSISTENCE OF SPECIES RICHNESS, PLANT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND INCIDENCE OF NOXIOUS WEEDS. 3. SEEDING WITH A WILDFLOWER MIXTURE WAS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ESTABLISHMENT METHOD TO ENHANCE PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS AND THIS EFFECT PERSISTED THROUGHOUT THE 7 YEARS OF THE EXPERIMENT ( = 16 CENTER DOT 4 +/- 0 CENTER DOT 43 SE PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS PER 1 X 3 M2 QUADRAT). MOWN ( = 6 CENTER DOT 01 +/- 0 CENTER DOT 30 SE) AND ROTAVATED ( = 9 CENTER DOT 7 +/- 0 CENTER DOT 34 SE) TREATMENTS CONTAINED SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER PLANT SPECIES; GRAZED CONTROLS CONTAINED 9 CENTER DOT 83 +/- 0 CENTER DOT 24 SPECIES. 4. GRAZING LED TO A SIGNIFICANT, BUT MODEST INCREASE IN SPECIES RICHNESS IN FENCED AND ROTAVATED PLOTS COMPARED TO THE MOWING TREATMENT, BUT HAD NO EFFECT IN SEEDED PLOTS. GRAZING ALSO LED TO AN INCREASED FREQUENCY AND COVER OF COMPETITIVE GRASSES IN THE SEEDED TREATMENT. 5. ALTHOUGH MARGIN WIDTH WAS NOT FOUND TO SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE SPECIES RICHNESS, THERE WAS INCREASED HERB COVER AND REDUCED ABUNDANCE OF NOXIOUS WEEDS IN THE WIDER SEEDED MARGINS. 6.SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. THE CHOICE OF ESTABLISHMENT METHOD AND SUBSEQUENT MANAGEMENT OF GRASSLAND FIELD MARGINS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THEIR CONSERVATION VALUE. THE BOTANICAL DIVERSITY OF MARGINS WITHIN INTENSIVELY MANAGED PASTURE CAN BE ENHANCED BY SOWING WILDFLOWER SEED MIXTURES. THIS DIVERSITY CAN BE MAINTAINED OVER TIME THROUGH APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT, I.E. EITHER THE REDUCTION OF HIGH GRAZING PRESSURE BY SEASONAL FENCING, OR ANNUAL MOWING. MANAGEMENT APPROACHES THAT INVOLVE MINIMAL CHANGE ARE CURRENTLY ADOPTED IN MANY AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES (SUCH AS FENCING AND/OR THE CESSATION OF NUTRIENT INPUTS) BUT DID NOT PRODUCE SWARDS OF CONSERVATION VALUE IN THIS STUDY.","48","3","551","560","NOXIOUS WEED; GRASSLAND; WILDFLOWER; GRAZING; PASTURE; GRAZING PRESSURE; FENCING; SPECIES RICHNESS; AGROFORESTRY; BIOLOGY","","","","","https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20113186803.html https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01951.x https://core.ac.uk/display/58828162 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01951.x/abstract https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01951.x https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20113186803","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1365-2664.2010.01951.X","","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01951.x","1511826457","","0","000-271-857-070-759; 002-016-799-105-785; 003-251-732-418-644; 008-292-810-248-496; 011-749-985-776-165; 018-426-147-707-10X; 018-640-896-090-749; 020-549-193-345-308; 022-914-244-424-002; 023-103-648-255-011; 025-983-895-963-761; 026-162-389-848-750; 026-672-810-037-223; 031-862-039-493-29X; 036-882-579-432-228; 043-940-041-145-856; 044-351-103-625-865; 047-946-954-821-823; 055-236-476-487-210; 056-789-845-462-569; 060-190-757-297-843; 061-875-467-468-761; 063-574-629-144-561; 063-617-276-329-073; 065-565-421-487-993; 067-912-727-549-225; 075-376-170-994-818; 075-844-306-800-635; 080-139-567-968-521; 086-371-510-806-278; 093-151-276-890-967; 093-861-925-204-733; 095-014-169-963-827; 097-691-909-747-128; 097-940-408-467-683; 102-307-069-255-349; 106-891-114-899-41X; 115-507-657-132-984; 117-345-687-903-78X; 118-418-614-389-661; 120-262-642-164-869; 121-171-332-057-120; 129-154-893-686-206; 132-432-149-294-20X; 143-664-921-134-562; 144-915-982-059-308; 158-315-323-825-426; 171-465-178-732-227; 171-723-833-352-554; 197-392-866-862-614","30","ROCHELLE FRITCH; HELEN SHERIDAN; JOHN A.

IN THE FIELD MARGINS OF 40 FARMS, INVERTEBRATE DIVERSITY AND THE ABUNDANCE OF THREE FUNCTIONAL GROUPS WERE ASSESSED IN RELATION TO AGE. THE DIVERSITY IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF SPECIES GROUPS WAS FOUND TO INCREASE WITH THE AGE OF THE MARGINS. THE ABUNDANCE OF HERBIVORES AND DETRITIVORES ALSO SHOWED A POSITIVE CORRELATION WITH THE AGE OF THE MARGINS. HOWEVER, THE ABUNDANCE OF PREDATORS DECREASED WITH INCREASING AGE. OLDER MARGINS SHOWED A HIGHER TOTAL VEGETATION COVER AND FEWER PLANT SPECIES, ALSO RESULTING IN LOWER PLANT SPECIES EVENNESS. WE SUGGEST SEVERAL CHANGES TO THE CURRENT AES REGULATIONS. FOR THE CONSERVATION OF INVERTEBRATE DIVERSITY, LONGER-LASTING FIELD MARGINS ARE DESIRABLE. IN ADDITION, OLD MARGINS ARE FAVOURED BY DETRITIVORES, A GROUP THAT HAS PARTICULAR DIFFICULTY FINDING SUITABLE HABITATS IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. HOWEVER, SUCH MARGINS ARE LESS FAVOURABLE FROM AN AGRICULTURAL PERSPECTIVE, AS THEY APPEAR UNSUITABLE FOR HIGH ABUNDANCES OF POTENTIALLY USEFUL PREDATORS AND THE HIGH VEGETATION COVER ATTRACTS MANY POTENTIALLY HARMFUL HERBIVORES.

THE 16 PLOTS (65 M LONG BY 3 M WIDE [213 FT LONG BY 10 FT WIDE]) WERE LAID IN A COMPLETELY RANDOMIZED BLOCK DESIGN WITH FOUR TREATMENTS: 0 M FILTER STRIP AND GRASS FILTER STRIPS OF 3, 6, OR 9 M (10, 20, OR 30 FT). THE SOIL TEXTURE WAS 42% SILT, 38% SAND, AND 20% CLAY WITH 3.1% OF ORGANIC MATTER; THE PH WAS 6.3; AND THE SLOPE WAS 2% TO 3%. RUNOFF-GENERATING PLOTS WERE LEFT BARE IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE RUNOFF. THE STRIPS WERE COMPOSED OF 45% CREEPING RED FESCUE (FESTUCA RUBRA L.), 45% BENT GRASS (AGROSTIS ALBA L.), AND 10% PERENNIAL RYEGRASS (LOLIUM PERENNE L.). GRASS FILTER STRIPS REDUCED EXPORTED DISSOLVED HERBICIDE CONCENTRATIONS AT LEAST BY HALF FOR THE FIRST TWO RAINFALLS OF EACH STUDY YEAR. BY THE END OF THE SAMPLING PERIOD FOR EACH SEASON, DISSOLVED CONCENTRATIONS FOR GRASS FILTER STRIPS WERE MOST OF THE TIME, EXCEPT FOR METOLACHLOR IN THE 6 M GRASS STRIP IN 1999, LESS THAN THE CRITERIA FOR THE PROTECTION OF AQUATIC LIFE (CHRONIC) (7.8 ΜG L−1 [7.8 PPB] FOR METOLACHLOR (PROVISORY) AND 1.8 ΜG L−1 [1.8 PPB] FOR ATRAZINE), WHICH WAS NOT THE CASE WITH THE 0 M STRIP. GRASS FILTER STRIPS REDUCED THE FREQUENCY AT WHICH THESE CRITERIA WERE EXCEEDED. GENERALLY, EXPORTED DISSOLVED HERBICIDE CONCENTRATIONS DECREASED WITH TIME EXCEPT WHEN A RAIN EVENT OF HIGH INTENSITY OCCURRED. DAR VALUES NEVER EXCEEDED 0.66 AND GENERALLY SHOWED AN INCREASING TREND WITH TIME DURING THE SAMPLING PERIODS OF 1998 TO 2000. GRASS FILTER STRIPS ARE AN EFFICIENT MITIGATION MEASURE AGAINST THE RISK OF CONTAMINATION OF SURFACE WATERS BY ATRAZINE AND METOLACHLOR.","68","5","419","427","RANDOMIZED BLOCK DESIGN; SOIL TEXTURE; LOLIUM PERENNE; AGROSTIS; FESTUCA RUBRA; METOLACHLOR; ATRAZINE; FILTER STRIP; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; AGRONOMY","","","","","https://www.jswconline.org/content/68/5/419.full.pdf https://www.jswconline.org/content/68/5/419 https://www.jswconline.org/lookup/doi/10.2489/jswc.68.5.419 http://espace.inrs.ca/6421/","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.2489/JSWC.68.5.419","","10.2489/jswc.68.5.419","2328191388","","0","000-279-995-037-216; 000-357-531-495-738; 007-029-250-638-239; 007-985-273-091-256; 011-230-574-777-701; 015-334-237-353-133; 019-057-578-554-139; 019-986-408-945-555; 022-491-237-741-390; 023-229-653-654-803; 024-556-636-186-088; 036-456-610-975-852; 045-183-737-727-595; 052-320-986-023-291; 053-361-949-593-735; 078-927-735-353-813; 088-334-197-330-778; 094-049-137-663-313; 096-878-710-039-072; 113-621-019-415-011; 119-010-695-168-082; 175-111-291-377-228; 178-140-173-536-98X; 199-436-393-511-658","1","PIERRE LAFRANCE; EMMANUELLE CARON; CLAUDE BERNARD","JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION","JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION","","LENS",0,"LAFRANCE P, 2013, JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION","LAFRANCE P, 2013, JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION"

YIELD DATA FOR WIND PROTECTED SUGAR BEET CROPS FROM THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS INDICATE THAT YIELD INCREASES OF AS MUCH AS 25% ARE POSSIBLE DURING YEARS WHEN YIELDS ARE LOW. DURING YEARS OF HIGH YIELD, HOWEVER, THE WINDBREAKS DID NOT INCREASE SUGAR BEET YIELD FURTHER.; ; EXCEPT IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE WINDBREAK WHERE SHADING OCCURRED, NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN NET RADIATION BETWEEN THE SHELTERED AND OPEN PLOTS. THE DAYTIME AIR TEMPERATURE AVERAGED 1.8°C GREATER AND THE VAPOR PRESSURE 4.0 MBAR GREATER IN THE SHELTERED PLOT THAN IN THE OPEN. BOTH AIR TEMPERATURE AND THE WATER VAPOR PRESSURE VARIED AS A FUNCTION OF DISTANCE FROM THE WINDBREAKS. AN AREA OF MAXIMUM INFLUENCE WAS OFTEN OBSERVED NEAR THE CENTER OF THE PROTECTED PLOT. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SHELTER AND OPEN WERE DECREASED DURING PERIODS OF STRONG WIND. DIFFERENCES IN TEMPERATURE AND VAPOR PRESSURE BETWEEN SHELTER AND OPEN WERE GREATER DURING THE DAY THAN AT NIGHT. THE WIND SPEED AT 25 CM ABOVE THE CROP WAS 40% OF THAT IN THE OPEN FIELD WHENEVER WIND SPEED IN THE OPEN WAS MORE THAN 120 CM/SEC. THE DAYTIME CONCENTRATION OF CO2 WAS AN AVERAGE OF 1 P.P.M. LOWER IN SHELTER THAN IN THE OPEN. NOCTURNAL CONCENTRATION WAS AN AVERAGE OF 3.5 P.P.M. GREATER IN SHELTER. THE LATTER DIFFERENCES WERE INVERSELY RELATED TO WIND SPEED AND WERE GREATEST WHEN WIND DIRECTION WAS PERPENDICULAR TO THE WINDBREAK. VERTICAL MIXING IN THE ATMOSPHERE IS, APPARENTLY, VIGOROUS ENOUGH TO PREVENT SIGNIFICANT DEPLETION OF CO2 IN A WINDBREAK PROTECTED FIELD. THE 1 P.P.M. LOWER CONCENTRATION OBSERVED OVER THE SHELTERED CROP SHOULD HAVE ONLY A NEGLIGIBLE INFLUENCE ON PHOTOSYNTHETIC RATE.; ; THE INCREASE IN VAPOR PRESSURE AND THE SLIGHT DECREASE IN [CO2] DURING THE DAY SUGGEST A DECREASE IN THE INTENSITY OF TURBULENT EXCHANGE IN SHELTER. THE CONCENTRATION OF WATER VAPOR EXCEEDS THAT OF CO2 BY SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. DECREASED TURBULENT EXCHANGE IN SHELTER HAS, THEREFORE, A FAR GREATER INFLUENCE ON THE CHANGE IN CONCENTRATION OF WATER VAPOR THAN OF CO2.","9","","241","263","WIND DIRECTION; WINDBREAK; ATMOSPHERE; WATER VAPOR; WATER USE; WIND SPEED; VAPOR PRESSURE; VAPOUR PRESSURE OF WATER; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; AGRONOMY","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0002157171900252","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/0002-1571(71)90025-2","","10.1016/0002-1571(71)90025-2","2064581230","","0","000-505-110-269-11X; 017-812-365-270-347; 019-088-886-707-370; 025-324-160-965-687; 030-912-498-423-297; 043-338-551-977-60X; 050-926-120-208-117; 054-382-970-109-433; 064-839-563-959-561; 075-640-984-387-822; 083-674-117-691-573; 101-857-821-569-419; 115-687-897-821-704; 149-347-033-372-916; 166-614-452-754-96X; 168-671-407-863-01X; 177-834-571-788-699; 182-899-504-529-097","46","K.W.

A TOTAL OF 390 MALE AND 373 FEMALE BEETLES WAS EXAMINED. EACH FEMALE WAS DISSECTED AND THE NUMBER OF RIPE EGGS COUNTED. THE NUTRITIONAL STATE WAS EXPRESSED BY A CONDITION FACTOR, WHICH WAS CALCULATED FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL BASED ON THE OBSERVED WEIGHT AND ELYTRA LENGTH OF MALE AND FEMALE P. CUPREUS. CARABIDS IN THE 1-YEAR-OLD WILDFLOWER AREAS CONTAINED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS RIPE EGGS THAN THOSE FROM THE 4-YEAR-OLD AREAS. THE CONDITION FACTOR OF FEMALE AND MALE BEETLES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN 1- THAN 2- TO 4-YEAR-OLD AREAS.

IN THIS STUDY, WE EXPLORED HABITAT FEATURES INFLUENCING ABUNDANCE AND DAMAGE OF MONK PARAKEETS (MYIOPSITTA MONACHUS) TO CORN (ZEA MAYS) AND SUNFLOWER (HELIANTHUS ANNUUS) FIELDS, AS A BASIS FOR THE DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR PREVENTING DAMAGE IN THE FUTURE. USING A MULTI-LEVEL APPROACH, WE EVALUATED WITHIN-FIELD, FIELD, AND LANDSCAPE VARIABLES AT THREE SPATIAL SCALES POTENTIALLY RELATED TO MONK PARAKEET ABUNDANCE AND DAMAGE IN CROP FIELDS. MONK PARAKEET ABUNDANCE AND DAMAGE WAS GREATER IN SUNFLOWER THAN IN CORN FIELDS. LANDSCAPE VARIABLES, SUCH AS DISTANCE TO NEAREST SITE WITH TREES, PERCENTAGE OF LANDSCAPE WITH TREES, AND AVAILABILITY OF FORAGING SITES FOR MONK PARAKEETS AROUND THE CROP FIELDS WERE MORE IMPORTANT THAN LOCAL VARIABLES IN EXPLAINING MONK PARAKEET DAMAGE TO CROP FIELDS. HOWEVER, LOCAL VARIABLES, SUCH AS FIELD AREA, PLANT DENSITY AND PERCENTAGE OF FIELD BORDER WITH TREES, ALSO WERE RELATED TO DAMAGE.

THIS SITE WAS COMPARED WITH OTHER BUFFER STRIPS DESIGNED ACCORDING TO THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS OF ITALIAN STANDARD 5.2 IN ITALY (M.D. 27417, DECEMBER 22, 2011). WHILE SOME OF THE SYSTEMS RESULTED VERY EFFECTIVE IN INORGANIC NITROGEN REMOVAL, REACHING VALUES OF 62 AND 75%, TWO OF THE MONITORED SITES RESULTED COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE EVEN IF REALIZED ACCORDING TO THE REQUIRED TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THIS WAS DUE TO A LACK OF HYDRAULIC CONNECTIVITY WITH CORG-RICH ACTIVE SOIL LAYERS IN CONTACT WITH THE RHIZOSPHERE.

THESE OODS ARE TRIGGERED WHEN HIGH QUANTITIES OF RUNO ARE GENERATED ON CROPLAND AND CAUSE SEVERE EROSION. THREE SOIL SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS ARE RELEVANT TO DETERMINE THE RUNO POTENTIAL OF CULTIVATED SOILS: SOIL COVER BY CROPS AND RESIDUES, SOIL SURFACE CRUST-ING AND ROUGHNESS. THESE CHARACTERISTICS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED ON 65 CULTIVATED ELDS THROUGHOUT 2005. A HEAVY RAINFALL EVENT REPRESENTATIVE FOR EVENTS TRIGGERING MUDDY OODS IN THE REGION (60 MM.H −1 DURING 30 MINUTES) HAS BEEN SIMULATED USING A 0.5 M 2 SIMULATOR ON ELDS WITH THE 17 MOST OBSERVED COMBINATIONS OF SOIL SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS IN CENTRAL BELGIUM. IN THE CASE OF (PLOUGHED) BARE UNCRUSTED SOILS, RUNO IS NOT OBSERVED, NOR IN THE CASE OF SOILS COVERED BY CROPS, SHOWING A TRANSITIONAL CRUST AND A MODERATE ROUGHNESS (1-2 CM). IN THE CASES WHERE RUNO HAS BEEN OBSERVED, MEAN RUNO COECIENTS RANGED FROM 13% (WHEAT IN JULY) TO 58% (SUGAR BEET OR MAIZE IN MAY AND JUNE). GRASSED BUER STRIPS (GBS) AND GRASSED WATERWAYS (GWW) SHOW A HIGHER RUNO COECIENT (62% FOR GBS AND 73% FOR GWW) THAN MOST CULTIVATED SOILS (13-58%). FURTHERMORE, IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT SMALL PLOT MEASUREMENTS CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE RUNO GENERATION AT THE ELD SCALE. A CLASSICATION OF RUNO GENERATION RISK BASED ON THE SURVEYS OF SOIL SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS HAS BEEN APPLIED TO COMMON CROPS OF CENTRAL BELGIUM. FEBRUARY AS WELL AS THE PERIOD BETWEEN MAY AND SEPTEMBER ARE THE MOST CRITICAL FOR RUNO AT THE ELD SCALE. HOWEVER, IT APPEARS FROM MONITORING OF A 16HA-CATCHMENT THAT THE HIGHEST RUNOFF VOLUMES AND PEAK DISCHARGES ARE RECORDED BETWEEN MAY AND AUGUST AFTER HEAVY RAINFALL, EXPLAINING WHY 85% OF MUDDY FLOODS ARE RECORDED DURING THIS PERIOD IN CENTRAL BELGIUM.","33","8","1285","1301","EROSION; RUNOFF CURVE NUMBER; URBAN RUNOFF; SOIL WATER; LOESS; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; AGRICULTURAL LAND; SURFACE RUNOFF; FLOOD MYTH","","","","","http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ESPL...33.1285E/abstract https://hal-cea.archives-ouvertes.fr/cea-02511869/document http://core.ac.uk/display/34191235 https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:36454 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/esp.1613 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/cea-02511869v1 https://hal-cea.archives-ouvertes.fr/cea-02511869v1","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1002/ESP.1613","","10.1002/esp.1613","2038064831","","0","002-206-195-990-960; 009-468-621-105-069; 011-627-453-383-445; 012-360-928-841-38X; 012-950-452-965-183; 013-383-050-421-747; 015-159-212-900-799; 016-210-220-419-097; 021-863-165-975-101; 025-160-206-463-837; 034-946-583-952-83X; 039-805-051-357-354; 050-198-618-361-634; 050-754-216-214-169; 051-977-236-741-374; 052-589-530-283-548; 061-329-945-465-357; 064-060-898-906-550; 064-426-922-912-154; 064-922-510-478-219; 065-544-351-338-227; 069-066-158-720-776; 069-886-182-022-795; 070-156-038-664-620; 070-314-573-875-21X; 070-963-307-072-465; 072-892-575-196-779; 078-941-624-364-000; 079-326-413-920-136; 083-431-696-176-966; 090-875-555-544-711; 096-208-638-422-460; 106-284-569-265-355; 109-207-190-837-590; 115-324-274-797-645; 116-723-108-473-594; 117-346-312-542-660; 117-570-639-891-826; 138-146-309-524-176; 142-630-095-786-662; 146-670-572-557-590; 147-322-551-945-32X; 153-259-039-057-508; 159-379-305-574-327; 160-724-809-014-446; 161-253-688-981-71X; 171-210-880-000-339; 182-417-171-721-245; 184-120-604-176-760; 194-158-767-830-671; 194-538-872-888-108","43","OLIVIER EVRARD; KAREL VANDAELE; CHARLES BIELDERS; BAS VAN WESEMAEL","EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS","EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS","","LENS",0,"EVRARD O, 2008, EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS","EVRARD O, 2008, EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS"

THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THESE ISSUES BY USING DATA COLLECTED FROM A DETAILED FIELD EXPERIMENT, CARRIED OUT ON TWO TOPOGRAPHICALLY DIFFERENT HILLSLOPES (ONE STEEP AND THE OTHER FLAT) LOCATED WITHIN AN AGRICULTURAL CATCHMENT IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA. CONTINUOUS HYDROMETRIC DATA AND MEASUREMENTS OF CHEMICAL TRACERS, GEOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS, AND NO3− CONCENTRATIONS TAKEN FROM THE SHALLOW PERCHED AQUIFER ACROSS RIPARIAN, MIDSLOPE, AND UPLAND LOCATIONS WERE ANALYZED AND INTERPRETED THROUGH A SIMPLE PROCESS-BASED NUMERICAL MODEL OF TRANSPORT AND REACTION. THE NO3− CONCENTRATION DATA INDICATED THAT THE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL PATTERNS OF NO3− CONCENTRATIONS WITHIN THE HILLSLOPES ARE LINKED TO THE STATE OF HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY OF THE THREE LANDSCAPE UNITS AS THE SHALLOW PERCHED AQUIFER DEVELOPED DURING THE WINTER. SIGNIFICANT NO3− ATTENUATION OCCURS WITHIN THE RIPARIAN ZONES AFTER THE TRANSPORT OF NO3− FROM MIDSLOPE SOURCES BEGINS. APPLICATION OF A MIXING MODEL, WHICH PARTITIONS THE RIPARIAN ZONES INTO THREE WATER SOURCE COMPONENTS, AND THE NUMERICAL MODEL OF NO3− TRANSPORT AND REACTION INDICATES THAT DIFFERENT MECHANISMS, DILUTION IN THE STEEP HILLSLOPE AND DENITRIFICATION IN THE FLAT HILLSLOPE, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH OF THE OBSERVED NO3− ATTENUATION IN THE RIPARIAN ZONES. IN THIS WAY, THIS WORK HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF HILLSLOPE TOPOGRAPHY IN DETERMINING THE RELATIVE ROLES OF TRANSPORT AND REACTION IN NO3− ATTENUATION AND EXPORT FROM RIPARIAN ZONES. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ALSO SUPPORTED THE USE OF THE DAMKOHLER NUMBER, A SIMPLE DIMENSIONLESS NUMBER THAT IS A MEASURE OF THE COMPETITION BETWEEN TRANSPORT AND REACTION PROCESSES, WHICH ALLOWED A FAVORABLE COMPARISON OF OUR FINDINGS WITH PREVIOUS RESULTS PUBLISHED IN THE LITERATURE FOR DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHICAL SETTINGS.","42","1","","","RIPARIAN ZONE; SPATIAL ECOLOGY; TEMPORAL SCALES; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; WATER TABLE; NITROGEN CYCLE; BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLE; FIELD EXPERIMENT; HYDROLOGY (AGRICULTURE)","","","","","https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2004WR003773 https://experts.illinois.edu/en/publications/nitrate-attenuation-in-agricultural-catchments-shifting-balances- https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/nitrate-attenuation-in-agricultural-catchments-shifting-balances- http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004WR003773/full https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2004WR003773 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006WRR....42.1408O/abstract http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004WR003773/abstract http://doi.wiley.com/10.1029/2004WR003773","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1029/2004WR003773","","10.1029/2004wr003773","1950680159","","0","000-600-406-746-566; 001-662-739-036-159; 003-356-925-268-321; 008-719-189-249-131; 010-193-923-056-157; 010-679-825-860-432; 013-073-418-696-543; 014-316-223-277-453; 015-385-795-850-37X; 015-514-563-181-208; 018-957-748-286-745; 021-187-528-186-865; 027-192-664-469-274; 036-855-367-119-906; 037-517-723-823-989; 037-814-622-324-954; 039-759-555-727-422; 044-756-455-196-49X; 044-896-650-028-584; 050-142-218-297-554; 050-432-420-347-696; 055-437-854-621-677; 061-657-784-363-466; 061-869-444-752-275; 067-179-757-135-745; 069-528-467-565-486; 075-429-883-991-330; 077-323-396-597-683; 077-354-829-416-449; 080-589-148-600-106; 083-692-916-137-156; 098-259-311-561-39X; 098-341-372-489-363; 098-611-699-285-909; 100-845-850-323-114; 104-294-000-915-575; 108-223-424-313-129; 118-889-039-185-769; 123-304-899-254-597; 128-450-484-626-122; 131-356-170-760-035; 133-007-756-045-351; 139-999-086-652-437; 140-458-255-752-935; 146-805-620-565-604; 150-539-908-471-485; 150-956-990-756-590; 153-455-821-143-99X; 156-457-714-937-063; 161-998-765-884-873; 171-764-485-151-086; 177-282-681-753-988; 177-521-755-905-661; 189-610-958-302-553","123","CARLOS OCAMPO; CAROLYN OLDHAM; MURUGESU SIVAPALAN","WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH","WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH","","LENS",0,"OCAMPO C, 2006, WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH","OCAMPO C, 2006, WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH"

MANY FACTORS AFFECT THIS ACCUMULATION, INCLUDING THE HEIGHT AND PERMEABILITY OF WINDBREAKS AND THE WIND SPEED, BUT IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED (LEWIS & DIBLEY 1970) THAT INSECTS ACCUMULATE BECAUSE THEY ARE CARRIED ON THE WIND AND ARE CAUGHT IN THE TURBULENT CIRCULATING AIR MASS TO THE LEEWARD OF THE WINDBREAKS. HAWKES (1 972A) SHOWED THAT ADULT ERIOISCHIA BRASSICAE ACCUMULATED AT HEDGES AND THIS BEHAVIOUR WAS ASSOCIATED WITH FEEDING FROM HEDGEROW FLOWERS.

IT IS LIKELY THAT BZ ALSO CAN BE EFFECTIVE FILTERS FOR SEDIMENT-BOUND PESTICIDES. THE RETENTION OF GLYPHOSATE, PROPICONAZOLE, FENPROPIMORPH AND SOIL PARTICLES WAS STUDIED IN SURFACE RUNOFF EXPERIMENTS WITH 5 M WIDE BUFFER ZONES. VOLUME PROPORTIONAL SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED AFTER EACH RUNOFF EPISODE (1999–2002). THE DISTRIBUTION COEFFICIENT (K D ) SHOWS MODERATE TO HIGH ADSORPTION OF THE PESTICIDES TO THE EXPERIMENTAL SOIL. RESULTS SHOW AVERAGE RETENTION EFFICIENCY OF ABOUT 51%, 48%, 85% AND 34% FOR PARTICLES, GLYPHOSATE, PROPICONAZOLE AND FENPROPIMORPH, RESPECTIVELY. THE AMOUNT OF AMPA (WHICH IS A DEGRADATION PRODUCT OF GLYPHOSATE), ENTERING THE BZ WAS HIGH; APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AMOUNT AS FOR GLYPHOSATE. THE RETENTION EFFICIENCY THROUGH THE BZ FOR AMPA WAS ABOUT 67%. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN REMOVAL EFFICIENCY (IN %) BETWEEN WINTER WITH SNOWMELT AND SUMMER. THIS IS POSSIBLY DUE TO DETACHMENT OF COARSER AGGREGATES DURING WINTER, WHICH TRAP MORE EASILY IN THE BZ.

WE EVALUATED MULTIREGION, MULTISPECIES AVIAN DENSITIES ON ROW-CROP FIELDS WITH NATIVE GRASS FIELD MARGINS (I.E., BUFFERS) AS PART OF THE FIRST U.S. AGRICULTURAL CONSERVATION PRACTICE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT HABITAT AND POPULATION RECOVERY OBJECTIVES OF A NATIONAL WILDLIFE CONSERVATION INITIATIVE. WE COORDINATED BREEDING SEASON POINT TRANSECT SURVEYS FOR 6 GRASSLAND BIRD SPECIES ON 1151 ROW-CROP FIELDS WITH AND WITHOUT NATIVE GRASS BUFFERS (9-37 M) IN 14 U.S. STATES (10 ECOREGIONS) FROM 2006 TO 2011. IN MOST REGIONS, BREEDING SEASON DENSITIES OF 5 OF 6 TARGETED BIRD SPECIES WERE GREATER IN THE 500-M SURROUNDING SURVEY POINTS CENTERED ON FIELDS WITH NATIVE GRASS BUFFERS THAN IN LANDSCAPES WITHOUT BUFFERS. RELATIVE EFFECT SIZES WERE GREATEST FOR NORTHERN BOBWHITE (COLINUS VIRGINIANUS), DICKCISSEL (SPIZA AMERICANA), AND FIELD SPARROW (SPIZELLA PUSILLA) IN THE MISSISSIPPI ALLUVIAL VALLEY AND EASTERN TALLGRASS PRAIRIE REGIONS. OTHER SPECIES (E.G., EASTERN MEADOWLARK [STURNELLA MAGNA], GRASSHOPPER SPARROW [AMMODRAMUS SAVANNARUM]) EXHIBITED INCONSISTENT RELATIVE EFFECT SIZES. BIRD DENSITIES ON FIELDS WITH AND WITHOUT BUFFERS WERE GREATEST IN THE CENTRAL MIXED-GRASS PRAIRIE REGION. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT STRATEGIC USE OF CONSERVATION BUFFERS IN REGIONS WITH THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR RELATIVE DENSITY INCREASES IN TARGET SPECIES WILL ELICIT GREATER RANGE-WIDE POPULATION RESPONSE THAN DIFFUSE, UNINFORMED, AND BROADLY DISTRIBUTED IMPLEMENTATION OF BUFFERS.

CARABIDS WERE MONITORED BY PITFALL TRAPPING IN RIPARIAN ZONES OPEN TO GRAZING, WIDE RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIPS (>5 M WIDE), NARROW BOUNDARY STRIPS (<2 M WIDE) AND ADJACENT FIELDS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE FACTORS INFLUENCING CARABID DIVERSITY AND ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE.

CONSEQUENTLY, WHILE THE PRESENCE OF WIDE RIPARIAN BUFFERS MAY NOT PROMOTE CARABID DIVERSITY WITHIN THE ACTUAL BUFFER STRIPS, BY ADDING AN ADDITIONAL HABITAT THAT SUPPORTS A DISTINCT CARABID ASSEMBLAGE, RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIPS MAY PROMOTE DIVERSITY AT THE LANDSCAPE LEVEL. CARABID ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE WAS DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION OF SOIL AND VEGETATION CHARACTERISTICS IN ADDITION TO PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES INCLUDING DISTANCE FROM THE WATERCOURSE AND WIDTH OF THE STRIP.

HOWEVER, THE PROCESSES GOVERNING CHANGES TO THE FLORAL BIODIVERSITY OF HEDGES ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. WE ANALYSED A UNIQUE, LONG-TERM DATA SET OF PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS OVER A 70 YEAR PERIOD AT 357 HEDGEROW SITES IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND TO QUANTIFY CHANGES IN Α, Β AND Γ DIVERSITY, AND IDENTIFY THE ROLE OF HEDGE MANAGEMENT AND OTHER POSSIBLE DRIVERS OF CHANGE. ALPHA DIVERSITY INCREASED IN HEDGEROWS, WHILE A REDUCTION IN Β DIVERSITY WAS INDICATED BY TAXONOMIC HOMOGENISATION, WHEREBY PREVIOUSLY DISTINCT COMMUNITIES OF SPECIES BECOME MORE SIMILAR TO ONE ANOTHER OVER TIME. CHANGES IN THE REGIONAL SPECIES POOL (Γ DIVERSITY) DIFFERED WITH PLANT LIFE-HISTORY; IT INCREASED FOR WOODY SPECIES BUT DECREASED AMONG HERBACEOUS HEDGE SPECIES. HEDGEROW COMMUNITIES SHIFTED TOWARDS SPECIES ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER SOIL FERTILITY, A MORE COMPETITIVE ECOLOGICAL STRATEGY AND, IN UNMANAGED HEDGEROWS, GREATER SHADE TOLERANCE. PROBABLE DRIVERS FOR THESE CHANGES INCLUDE THE MOVE FROM TRADITIONAL FORMS OF MANAGEMENT SUCH AS COPPICING AND HEDGE-LAYING TOWARDS EITHER NO MANAGEMENT OR FREQUENT CUTTING WITH A MECHANICAL FLAIL, AND EUTROPHICATION. THE EXTENT OF CHANGES IN PLANT DIVERSITY OVER TIME WAS DETERMINED BY BOTH HISTORICAL AND RECENT HEDGEROW MANAGEMENT, BUT THESE MANAGEMENT EFFECTS VARIED WITH PLANT LIFE-HISTORY ATTRIBUTES. HOWEVER, CHANGES IN HEDGE QUALITY AND FLORAL DIVERSITY WERE NOT LINKED DIRECTLY TO A 60% INCREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF LAND USE CATEGORIES CLASSIFIED AS ‘INTENSIVE’ ADJACENT TO THE SITES OVER THE 70 YEARS.

IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER OR NOT LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS AFFECTED THE NUMBER OF CODLING MOTHS IN COMMERCIAL ORCHARDS. TO DO THIS, WE COLLECTED OVERWINTERING LARVAE IN 2006 AND 2007 IN 76 ORCHARDS OVER A 70 KM² AREA IN SOUTHEASTERN FRANCE. WE ANALYSED VARIATIONS IN THE NUMBER OF LARVAE USING CORRELATION TESTS AND LINEAR MODELS. AS INDEPENDENT VARIABLES, WE TOOK BOTH CHARACTERISTICS OF FOCUS ORCHARDS (PEAR VS. APPLE, ORGANIC VS. CONVENTIONAL ORCHARDS) AND OF THEIR SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE (ORCHARD DENSITY AND HEDGEROW NETWORK ATTRIBUTES) INTO ACCOUNT IN BUFFERS WITH WIDTHS VARYING FROM 50 TO 500 M. ALTHOUGH THE CODLING MOTH IS SPECIALISED ON ORCHARDS, THE NUMBER OF CODLING MOTHS WAS LOWER IN ORCHARDS WITHIN A HIGH ORCHARD DENSITY AREA. THERE WAS SOME INDICATION THAT THIS EFFECT WAS MOSTLY DUE TO THE DENSITY OF CONVENTIONAL ORCHARDS AND THUS TO THE INTENSITY OF INSECTICIDE TREATMENTS. CONVERSELY, WE FOUND NO PARTICULAR EFFECT OF ABANDONED OR ORGANIC ORCHARDS. IN 2006, THE NUMBER OF CODLING MOTHS WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN A FOCUS ORCHARD WHEN THE HEDGEROW NETWORK ACTED AS A PROTECTION AGAINST THE PREVAILING WIND. FINALLY, MAJOR EFFECTS OF LANDSCAPE VARIABLES ON THE NUMBER OF CODLING MOTHS WERE OBSERVED FOR DISTANCES OF LESS THAN 150 M FROM THE FOCUS ORCHARDS, SUGGESTING THAT CODLING MOTH MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE ORGANISED OVER AREAS OF ABOUT 16 HA.","24","3","337","349","ORGANIC FARMING; INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT; ECOLOGY; POPULATION DENSITY; GEOGRAPHY; PEST ANALYSIS; OVERWINTERING; CODLING MOTH; TORTRICIDAE; ORCHARD; AGRONOMY","","","","","https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-008-9308-6 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093064667 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20093064667.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10980-008-9308-6 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pierre_Franck/publication/225180724_The_influence_of_landscape_on_insect_pest_dynamics_A_case_study_in_southeastern_France/links/0fcfd50b625a454ab7000000.pdf https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301596465","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1007/S10980-008-9308-6","","10.1007/s10980-008-9308-6","2105552755","","0","002-515-531-907-513; 005-346-710-452-221; 006-278-530-116-460; 006-308-525-460-894; 007-260-320-632-29X; 007-564-661-930-546; 009-522-503-130-954; 010-162-524-522-227; 011-508-246-956-659; 017-516-181-294-137; 022-040-574-352-916; 024-860-530-135-158; 031-094-771-196-289; 031-114-644-626-51X; 032-376-829-956-335; 038-050-491-689-943; 040-930-611-597-523; 041-981-707-584-66X; 042-336-185-080-206; 043-922-856-983-819; 048-222-577-387-904; 050-580-947-928-66X; 056-892-630-404-500; 058-479-800-510-95X; 069-366-512-460-44X; 074-138-002-216-945; 075-210-767-428-43X; 077-532-222-012-842; 087-109-316-580-01X; 090-412-082-790-734; 094-515-841-908-877; 098-312-271-690-700; 102-602-517-987-677; 108-218-821-288-91X; 110-111-894-688-860; 127-460-078-837-613; 129-005-638-846-365; 130-698-554-759-854; 143-082-599-603-403; 151-393-676-185-507; 153-219-521-750-160; 156-624-196-949-616; 171-447-946-311-398; 176-506-367-701-104","96","BENOIT RICCI; PIERRE FRANCK; JEAN-FRANÇOIS TOUBON; JEAN-CHARLES BOUVIER; BENOÎT SAUPHANOR; CLAIRE LAVIGNE","LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","","LENS",0,"RICCI B, 2008, LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","RICCI B, 2008, LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY"

THE STUDY WAS OVER SEVERAL YEARS (WINTER AND SUMMER) AT TWO SITES, HUNTINGDON AND SWAVESEY, IN EAST ANGLIA UK. 2. THE PRESENT PAPER DEALS WITH SIMILAR RELATIONSHIPS, BUT THE BIRD VARIABLES USED ARE THE ABUNDANCE OF INDIVIDUAL SPECIES, OF GROUPS OF SPECIES (ALL FINCHES, ALL RAPTORS, ETC.) AND OF ALL BIRDS, AS WELL AS SIMPSON'S INDEX OF DIVERSITY. THIS REQUIRED EXTENSIVE MODELLING - 105 MODELS FOR HUNTINGDON AND 174 FOR SWAVESEY. 3. THE RESULTS OF ALL 279 MODELS ARE PRESENTED IN A CONDENSED FORM, HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OF GIVEN FIELD BOUNDARY ATTRIBUTES TO PARTICULAR SPECIES OR GROUPS OF SPECIES. 4. LIKE BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS IN THE EARLIER PAPER, THE ABUNDANCE OF MANY SPECIES WAS STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THE LAND USE, AND BY THE MAIN VEGETATION VARIABLES (TREE HEIGHT AND NUMBER, HEDGEROW LENGTH, HEIGHT AND WIDTH). LAND USE WAS IMPORTANT TO A LARGER MAJORITY OF SPECIES, THE EXCEPTIONS BEING CARRION CROW, PHEASANT, REED BUNTING AND WREN. 5. VERGE WIDTH APPEARED IMPORTANT FOR SMALL INSECTIVORES (BLUE TIT) AND WAS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR SEED EATING BIRDS, E.G. MOST FINCHES AND BUNTINGS, RED-LEGGED PARTRIDGE IN SUMMER, AND CARRION CROW AND SKYLARK IN WINTER. 6. DITCH DIMENSIONS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ABUNDANCE OF SOME SEED EATERS (LINNET, REED BUNTING AND GOLDFINCH) AND INSECTIVORES (BLACKBIRD, GREAT TIT, SKYLARK, SONG THRUSH AND WREN). KESTREL AND THE GROUPS RAPTORS, CORVIDS, WADERS AND AQUATICS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE DITCHES. 7. THOUGH THE GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRESCRIPTIONS TO BENEFIT THE MAJORITY OF FARMLAND BIRDS WERE FOUND TO BE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE EARLIER PAPER, THE DETAILED SPECIES SPECIFIC MODELLING MADE IT POSSIBLE TO EXAMINE THE HABITAT REQUIREMENTS OF PARTICULAR SPECIES. 8.

THIS STUDY EVALUATED THE IMPACT OF RIPARIAN PLANTINGS ON WATER QUALITY OF LOWLAND STREAMS IN THE LAKE ELLESMERE CATCHMENT. A PAIRED-CATCHMENT DESIGN ON FOUR RIVER REACHES WAS USED TO COMPARE RESTORED RIPARIAN BUFFERS WITH CONTROL SITES UPSTREAM. CHEMICAL WATER QUALITY SAMPLING WAS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITY ASSESSMENT. EQUIVOCAL BENEFITS OF RIPARIAN RESTORATION WERE OBSERVED, WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN SOME VARIABLES BUT NOT IN OTHERS. RIPARIAN RESTORATION HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON WATER QUALITY IN TERMS OF INCREASING DISSOLVED OXYGEN AND DECREASING TURBIDITY. HOWEVER, CONDUCTIVITY INCREASED AT PLANTED SITES AND NO CHANGES WERE OBSERVED IN OTHER VARIABLES. THESE FINDINGS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE INSUFFICIENT WIDTH OF ALL FOUR BUFFERS, AND GAPS IN THE BUFFER SYSTEM CONTRIBUTING TO POOR WATER QUALITY. ALTHOUGH VARIABLE RESPONSES WERE SEEN IN INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, THIS RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT EVEN NARROW PLANTED BUFFER STRIPS MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING SOME WATER QUALITY PARAMETERS. THE OVERALL MIXED RESULTS PRESENT A FAIR ASSESSMENT OF THE BENEFITS OF RIPARIAN RESTORATION THAT MAY BE EXPECTED WITHIN A RELATIVELY SHORT TIME FOLLOWING VEGETATION ESTABLISHMENT.

THEREFORE, WE EXAMINED POTENTIAL DIFFERENCES IN SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS OF CLAYPAN SOIL PLANTED TO VFS WITH DIFFERING VEGETATION AND A TRADITIONAL ROW-CROP SYSTEM IN A MAIZE–SOYBEAN ROTATION.

THE GRASS VFS SOIL EXHIBITED THE GREATEST DEHYDROGENASE ACTIVITY LEVELS AND FDA ACTIVITY WAS GREATER IN THE GRASS AND AGROFORESTRY (I.E., TREE–GRASS) VFS SOILS RELATIVE TO THE CROPLAND SOIL. THE PLFA ANALYSIS REVEALED COMMUNITY STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES UNDERLYING THESE FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCES. THE AGROFORESTRY VFS SOIL WAS CHARACTERIZED BY A GREATER PROPORTION OF TOTAL BACTERIA, GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIA, ANAEROBIC BACTERIA AND MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI THAN THE CROPLAND SOIL.

ENHANCING FLORAL RESOURCES IS A WIDELY ACCEPTED MEASURE FOR PROMOTING BEES IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES, BUT EFFECTIVENESS VARIES CONSIDERABLY BETWEEN LANDSCAPES AND REGIONS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THIS VARIATION IS MAINLY DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION OF THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF MEASURES ON LOCAL FLORAL RESOURCES AND THE AVAILABILITY OF FLORAL RESOURCES IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE. TO TEST THIS, WE ESTABLISHED WILDFLOWER STRIPS IN FOUR EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, USING THE SAME SEED MIXTURE OF FORAGE PLANTS SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AT BEES. WE USED A BEFORE-AFTER CONTROL-IMPACT APPROACH TO ANALYSE THE IMPACTS OF WILDFLOWER STRIPS ON BUMBLEBEES, SOLITARY BEES AND RED LIST SPECIES AND EXAMINED TO WHAT EXTENT EFFECTS WERE AFFECTED BY LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE-WIDE FLORAL RESOURCE AVAILABILITY, LAND-USE INTENSITY AND LANDSCAPE COMPLEXITY. WILDFLOWER STRIPS GENERALLY ENHANCED LOCAL BEE ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS, INCLUDING RED-LISTED SPECIES. EFFECTIVENESS OF THE WILDFLOWER STRIPS INCREASED WITH THE LOCAL CONTRAST IN FLOWER RICHNESS CREATED BY THE STRIPS AND FURTHERMORE DEPENDED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF FLORAL RESOURCES IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE, WITH DIFFERENT PATTERNS FOR SOLITARY BEES AND BUMBLEBEES. EFFECTS ON SOLITARY BEES APPEARED TO DECREASE WITH INCREASING AMOUNT OF LATE-SEASON ALTERNATIVE FLORALRESOURCES IN THE LANDSCAPE, WHEREAS EFFECTS ON BUMBLEBEES INCREASED WITH INCREASING EARLY-SEASON LANDSCAPE-WIDE FLORAL RESOURCE AVAILABILITY.SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT THE EFFECTS OF WILDFLOWER STRIPS ON BEES ARE LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE EXTENT TO WHICH LOCAL FLOWER RICHNESS IS INCREASED. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS MEASURE COULD THEREFORE BE ENHANCED BY MAXIMIZING THE NUMBER OF BEE FORAGE SPECIES IN SEED MIXTURES, AND BY MANAGEMENT REGIMES THAT EFFECTIVELY MAINTAIN FLOWER RICHNESS IN THE STRIPS THROUGH THE YEARS. IN ADDITION, FOR BUMBLEBEES SPECIFICALLY, OUR STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF A CONTINUOUS SUPPLY OF FOOD RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE SEASON.

HEDGEROW QUALITY CAN BE GREATLY AFFECTED EITHER BY OVER- OR UNDER-MANAGEMENT. NEGLECT OF HEDGEROWS IS AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AS TRADITIONAL MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES SUCH AS HEDGELAYING BECOME ECONOMICALLY UNVIABLE. IN THE UK, FUNDING FOR HEDGE MANAGEMENT IS AVAILABLE UNDER AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES BUT RELATIVELY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW THIS IMPACTS ON WIDER BIODIVERSITY. WE USED A RANDOMISED BLOCK EXPERIMENT TO INVESTIGATE HOW HABITAT STRUCTURAL CHANGE, ARISING FROM A RANGE OF TECHNIQUES TO REJUVENATE HEDGEROWS (INCLUDING MORE ECONOMIC/MECHANISED ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL HEDGELAYING), AFFECTED INVERTEBRATE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY. WE COMBINED DIGITAL IMAGE ANALYSIS WITH ESTIMATES OF FOLIAGE BIOMASS AND QUALITY TO SHOW WHICH ASPECTS OF HEDGE STRUCTURE WERE MOST AFFECTED BY THE REJUVENATION TREATMENTS. ALL INVESTIGATED ASPECTS OF HABITAT STRUCTURE VARIED CONSIDERABLY WITH MANAGEMENT TYPE, THOUGH THE ABUNDANCE OF HERBIVORES AND PREDATORS WAS AFFECTED PRIMARILY BY FOLIAGE DENSITY. DETRITIVORE ABUNDANCE WAS MOST STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH VARIATION IN HEDGE GAP SIZE. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT HABITAT STRUCTURE IS AN IMPORTANT ORGANISING FORCE IN INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITY INTERACTIONS AND THAT MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE MAY AFFECT TROPHIC GROUPS DIFFERENTLY. SPECIFICALLY WE FIND THAT ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF HEDGEROW REJUVENATION COULD SUPPORT ABUNDANCES OF INVERTEBRATES COMPARABLE OR EVEN HIGHER THAN TRADITIONAL HEDGELAYING, WITH POSITIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RESTORATION OF A LARGER AREA OF HEDGEROW HABITAT ON A LIMITED BUDGET.","16","5","443","451","BIOMASS (ECOLOGY); BIODIVERSITY; DEAD HEDGE; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; COMMUNITY; HERBIVORE; AGROFORESTRY; TROPHIC LEVEL; ABUNDANCE (ECOLOGY); BIOLOGY","","","","DEFRA; NERC CENTRE FOR ECOLOGY AND HYDROLOGY","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179115000596 https://core.ac.uk/display/33452798 https://core.ac.uk/download/33452798.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.BAAE.2015.04.002","","10.1016/j.baae.2015.04.002","2060830412","","0","002-613-900-013-62X; 009-263-421-936-141; 009-737-636-338-028; 010-225-312-935-498; 016-454-058-212-274; 023-045-119-361-270; 024-743-924-814-572; 030-309-137-488-224; 034-662-603-831-951; 042-195-189-711-603; 042-765-530-097-726; 053-002-848-047-394; 057-283-401-649-275; 063-593-316-301-291; 065-315-870-907-728; 083-377-217-246-02X; 084-101-049-675-878; 084-893-330-370-820; 094-060-953-943-724; 097-095-789-567-42X; 101-401-792-322-920; 107-610-431-706-338; 113-711-894-515-431; 120-327-841-345-544; 123-531-564-917-678; 126-812-080-751-085; 128-892-311-920-110; 134-312-556-034-559; 149-250-414-297-242; 150-325-162-873-23X; 182-236-996-077-99X; 190-696-675-608-128","18","SAM R.

RESULTS SHOW THAT WITHOUT VEGETATIVE FILTER STRIP THE HERBICIDE LOAD THAT REACHES THE SURFACE WATER IS ABOUT 5–6 G HA −1  YEAR −1 FOR METOLACHLOR AND TERBUTHYLAZINE (I.E. 0.5–0.9% OF THE APPLIED RATE), CONFIRMING THAT RUNOFF FROM FLAT FIELDS AS IN THE PO VALLEY CAN HAVE A MINOR EFFECT ON THE WATER QUALITY, AND THAT MOST OF THE RISK IS POSED BY A FEW, OR EVEN JUST ONE EXTREME RAINFALL EVENT WITH A RETURN PERIOD OF ABOUT 25–27 YEARS, CAUSING RUNOFF WITH A MAXIMUM CONCENTRATION OF 64–77 ΜG L −1 .

ENHANCEMENT OF WILDLIFE HABITAT, WHILE IDENTIFIED AS A FUNCTION OF SUCH SYSTEMS, HAS OFTEN BEEN OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE TO SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVES. THOUGH GREATLY IMPORTANT, LITTLE CONSIDERATION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO HOW SPECIFIC SPECIES WILL RESPOND TO THE DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT OF RIPARIAN BUFFERS OR OTHER CONSERVATION LANDS. THIS STUDY COMPARED AVIAN COMMUNITIES WITHIN A CHRONOSEQUENCE OF RIPARIAN BUFFERS ESTABLISHED ON PREVIOUSLY CROPPED OR PASTURED LAND WITH THOSE OF THE NEARBY MATRIX LAND COVER TYPES (ROW CROP FIELDS AND AN INTENSIVELY GRAZED PASTURE). THE RIPARIAN BUFFERS CONSISTED OF NATIVE GRASSES, FORBS, AND WOODY VEGETATION ESTABLISHED AT THREE DIFFERENT TIMES (2, 9, AND 14+ YEARS PRIOR TO SURVEY). AT EACH SITE, 10 MIN POINT COUNTS FOR BREEDING BIRDS WERE CONDUCTED USING 50 M FIXED RADIUS PLOTS, WHICH WERE VISITED EIGHT TIMES BETWEEN MAY 15 AND JULY 10, 2008. A TOTAL OF 54 BIRD SPECIES WERE OBSERVED OVER ALL OF THE STUDY SITES. THE RE-ESTABLISHED RIPARIAN BUFFERS IN THIS STUDY HAD HIGHER BIRD ABUNDANCE, RICHNESS, AND DIVERSITY THAN THE CROP AND PASTURE SITES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT RE-ESTABLISHING NATIVE RIPARIAN VEGETATION IN AREAS OF INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE WILL PROVIDE HABITAT FOR A BROAD SUITE OF BIRD SPECIES, BUT THAT SPECIFIC SPECIES WILL REFLECT SUCCESSIONAL STAGE, HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL VEGETATIVE STRUCTURE, AND COMPOSITIONAL DIVERSITY OF THE BUFFER VEGETATION. THESE RESULTS EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF MATCHING BUFFER DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT TO SPECIES REQUIREMENTS IF THE OBJECTIVES ARE TO ATTRACT SPECIFIC TARGET SPECIES OR SPECIES GROUPS.","79","1","97","110","RIPARIAN ZONE; VEGETATION; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; GRAZING; CHRONOSEQUENCE; SPECIES RICHNESS; AGROFORESTRY; SPECIES DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE (ECOLOGY)","","","","","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-009-9270-6 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-009-9270-6/fulltext.html https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103162641 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103162641.html","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1007/S10457-009-9270-6","","10.1007/s10457-009-9270-6","2056774526","","0","002-804-556-350-740; 007-571-395-247-941; 009-969-155-123-483; 010-423-042-177-734; 010-508-256-532-52X; 015-373-969-372-614; 017-298-227-855-778; 018-031-816-823-049; 018-398-977-970-251; 019-167-790-540-348; 020-360-071-779-440; 021-080-303-062-714; 021-933-813-475-043; 023-683-277-287-21X; 025-715-932-386-959; 029-094-242-107-621; 035-049-792-223-867; 042-985-809-167-140; 051-855-217-004-154; 059-472-939-527-494; 068-452-604-669-157; 072-782-954-705-847; 079-196-971-304-319; 085-403-104-210-257; 092-010-579-589-586; 093-485-123-537-134; 113-900-387-576-996; 115-611-647-492-038; 129-795-413-211-042; 135-655-196-423-016; 137-969-870-156-955; 140-853-509-691-635; 152-835-722-718-83X; 166-952-622-390-540; 170-230-483-322-002; 191-359-559-824-869; 191-508-311-193-465; 191-820-479-471-007","34","SARA ALEXANDRA BERGES; LISA A.

MALES HAD LARGER HOME RANGES, AND WERE MORE MOBILE THAN FEMALES. RANGES WERE LARGER, AND ANIMALS MORE MOBILE, BEFORE HARVEST THAN AFTERWARDS. THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN RANGE SIZES OF BREEDING AND NON-BREEDING ANIMALS AFTER HARVEST, SUGGESTING THAT CHANGES IN HABITAT USE WERE NOT A FUNCTION OF CESSATION OF BREEDING. BEFORE HARVEST, WOOD MICE USED HABITATS WITHIN THEIR RANGES AT RANDOM, AND THEIR RANGES CONTAINED A HIGH PROPORTION OF CROPPED AREA. AFTER HARVEST THEY PREFERRED HEDGEROW AND AVOIDED MARGIN SET-ASIDE WITHIN THEIR RANGES, BUT DID NOT SIMILARLY AVOID THE SET-ASIDE BLOCK. THE PROPORTION OF CROPPED AREA WITHIN THEIR RANGES DECREASED AFTER HARVEST, AND THE PROPORTION OF MARGIN INCREASED.

EVAPOTRANSPIRATION RATES, SURFACE RUNOFF AND PERCOLATION OF WATER ACROSS A SOIL PROFILE ARE CONTROLLED BY SHELTERBELTS. THE HEAT TRANSFERS FROM CULTIVATED FIELDS TO SHELTERBELTS BY ADVECTION PROCESSES ENHANCE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION RATES FROM TREES. DEPTH OF GROUNDWATER TABLE AND THERMAL CONDITIONS HAVE IMPORTANT BEARING ON THE UPTAKE OF GROUNDWATER BY TREES. THE STUDIES SHOWED THAT IN THE TUREW AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE, LOCATED NEAR POZNAN, POLAND, SHELTERBELTS USE FOR EVAPOTRANSPIRATION 40 PERCENT MORE WATER THAN CULTIVATED FIELDS. FOR AIR HEATING CULTIVATED FIELDS USE 280 PERCENT OF SOLAR ENERGY MORE THAN SHELTERBELTS. THE SHELTERBELTS LIMIT N-NO 3 − SPREADING WITH GROUNDWATER VERY EFFECTIVELY. CONCENTRATIONS OF INFLOWING NITRATES WITH GROUNDWATER DROPPED TO 2.3–24.4 PERCENT OF THE INPUT FROM FIELDS. IN CONTRAST TO NITRATE IONS THE AMMONIUM BEHAVE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT. OFTEN CONCENTRATION OF AMMONIUM INCREASED IN GROUNDWATER UNDER SHELTERBELTS. HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF N-NH 4 + UNDER SHELTERBELTS THAN UNDER FIELD INDICATED THAT AMMONIUM IONS WERE RELEASED DURING DECOMPOSITION OF ORGANIC MATTER.

THESE ARE MOST OFTEN ESTABLISHED WITH SOWN SEED MIXTURES OF GRASSES AND HERB SPECIES. WE STUDIED THE IMPACT OF CUTTING MANAGEMENT AND THE ROLE OF THE SEEDBANK ON PLANT SPECIES DIVERSITY OF A SOWN BUFFER STRIP. TWO MAIN HYPOTHESES H1 WERE TESTED IN THIS STUDY: (I) SWARD CUTTING AND REMOVAL HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON PLANT SPECIES DIVERSITY IN A BUFFER ZONE ADJACENT TO A CULTIVATED FIELD AND (II) THE BUFFER ZONE SOIL SEEDBANK AND ADJACENT GRASSLAND ACT AS A SPECIES SOURCE FOR THE MANAGED BUFFER ZONE. AFTER 5 YEARS OF MANAGEMENT, THE NUMBER OF SPECIES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AND THE LITTER COVERAGE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN PLOTS MOWN YEARLY WITH CUTTINGS REMOVED THAN IN MOWN PLOTS WITH THE CUTTINGS LEFT OR AN UNCUT CONTROL. THE ABUNDANCE OF ELYMUS REPENS WAS NOT AFFECTED BY THE CUTTING MANAGEMENT. TO REDUCE E. REPENS PROBABLY NEEDS CUTTING MORE FREQUENTLY THAN ONCE PER YEAR. CUTTING MANAGEMENT DID NOT REDUCE EASILY-SOLUBLE PHOSPHORUS IN SOILS. FOR SPECIES COLONISATION, ADJACENT GRASSLAND PLAYED A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE THAN THE SOIL SEEDBANK. WE CONCLUDE THAT, IN THIS STUDY, THE REDUCED LITTER COVER, TOGETHER WITH ADJACENT SOURCES OF SPECIES, RESULTED IN THE GRADUAL INCREASE IN SPECIES DIVERSITY IN THE SPECIES-POOR BUFFER HABITAT. THIS STUDY TOOK PLACE IN A SINGLE LOCATION AND SIMILAR STUDIES IN ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS WOULD BE HELPFUL IN ASSESSING THE GENERALITY OF OUR RESULTS. ON THE EVIDENCE OF THIS STUDY, THE CONTRACT PERIODS OF AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL SCHEMES SHOULD BE LONGER THAN 5 YEARS TO ENSURE CUTTING DOES RESULT IN POSITIVE BENEFITS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF BIODIVERSITY.","51","6","641","649","BIODIVERSITY; CUTTING; GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY; WEED; BUFFER ZONE; BUFFER STRIP; AGROFORESTRY; SPECIES DIVERSITY; AGRONOMY; ARABLE LAND; BIOLOGY","","","","","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2011.00888.x","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1365-3180.2011.00888.X","","10.1111/j.1365-3180.2011.00888.x","1933842309","","0","002-832-393-044-316; 003-461-880-854-275; 003-617-703-274-032; 005-769-046-282-205; 014-226-881-970-330; 015-072-120-385-142; 020-041-155-134-270; 031-587-910-976-142; 032-192-970-524-05X; 039-505-502-984-134; 054-715-078-148-813; 062-236-461-028-808; 067-095-582-035-356; 070-239-213-610-528; 071-543-579-732-418; 082-139-190-700-359; 097-401-842-948-735; 099-437-976-818-570; 110-254-118-451-922; 110-743-613-765-547; 114-485-264-414-63X; 118-104-179-448-652; 132-397-715-162-287; 137-863-970-555-683; 139-587-466-264-697; 155-691-175-864-748; 158-040-572-868-750; 161-300-804-429-199; 167-175-414-731-307; 170-577-758-467-415","8","SANNA TARMI; JUHA HELENIUS; TERHO HYVÖNEN","WEED RESEARCH","WEED RESEARCH","","LENS",0,"TARMI S, 2011, WEED RESEARCH","TARMI S, 2011, WEED RESEARCH"

WE EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF UNCROPPED CULTIVATED MARGINS (UCM), SPRING FALLOW (SF) AND CROPPED CONSERVATION HEADLANDS WITH (CH) OR WITHOUT FERTILISER INPUTS (CH(NF)) IN SUSTAINING PLANT SPECIES DIVERSITY AND RARE SPECIES, IN ENGLAND, UK. SAMPLING WAS STRATIFIED AT 1 M, 3 M AND 5 M FROM THE EDGE OF THE MARGIN AND IN EIGHT REGIONS TO ASSESS ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON SPECIES COMPOSITION. SPECIES DIVERSITY, INCLUDING RARE SPECIES, WAS HIGHEST ON UCM, FOLLOWED BY SF AND CH(NF) MARGINS. DIVERSITY WAS GENERALLY LOWER ON CROPPED MARGINS DUE TO COMPETITION FROM THE CROP. FERTILISED CH MARGINS WERE THE LEAST DIVERSE OPTION AND WERE SIMILAR TO CEREAL CROP CONTROLS. SPECIES DIVERSITY WAS GREATEST AT THE EDGE OF ALL EXCEPT UCM MARGINS AND THERE WAS A STRONG LATITUDINAL DECLINE IN OVERALL DIVERSITY AND RARE SPECIES. AE MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTED FOR MORE VARIATION IN SPECIES COMPOSITION THAN HABITAT CONTEXT, PHYSICAL/CLIMATIC VARIABLES, SOIL PROPERTIES OR REGION. AT CROPPED SITES, THERE WAS OVERLAP BETWEEN MARGIN TYPE AND OTHER VARIABLES BUT SOIL PROPERTIES EXPLAINED LESS VARIATION. AT UNCROPPED SITES, MANAGEMENT AND PHYSICAL/CLIMATE VARIABLES EXPLAINED MOST VARIATION BUT SOIL PROPERTIES WERE MORE IMPORTANT THAN AT CROPPED SITES. THESE FINDINGS CONFIRM THAT AE SCHEMES ARE EFFECTIVE IN CONSERVING ARABLE PLANTS, INCLUDING RARE SPECIES, ACROSS A VARIETY OF LANDSCAPE TYPES. MORE PRECISE GEOGRAPHICAL TARGETING, IMPROVED CONTROL OF COMPETITIVE SPECIES AND RESEARCH ON THE HABITAT REQUIREMENTS OF RARE SPECIES WILL IMPROVE THE OVERALL EFFICACY OF SCHEMES IN THE FUTURE.","136","2","260","270","SUMMER FALLOW; BIODIVERSITY; RARE SPECIES; HABITAT; GEOGRAPHY; CONTEXT (LANGUAGE USE); AGROFORESTRY; SPECIES DIVERSITY; ARABLE LAND; COMPETITION (BIOLOGY)","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320706005301","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.BIOCON.2006.11.026","","10.1016/j.biocon.2006.11.026","2078317226","","0","012-926-285-189-171; 013-284-533-686-041; 014-229-118-471-777; 016-573-648-664-125; 025-149-893-113-195; 032-842-523-386-275; 047-946-954-821-823; 053-551-700-281-485; 054-274-474-416-858; 056-099-523-856-735; 061-723-728-946-07X; 064-975-099-130-640; 065-071-886-701-523; 073-977-220-319-580; 074-013-046-940-514; 074-793-529-288-006; 079-892-551-731-823; 080-164-660-083-693; 082-540-198-876-114; 083-102-813-642-755; 083-714-994-906-170; 085-894-135-330-699; 109-834-836-962-968; 114-421-043-522-327; 124-362-582-173-520; 132-380-117-709-640; 133-048-738-071-733; 139-998-842-847-885; 149-426-073-095-189; 152-856-891-760-185; 155-372-171-259-972; 197-798-610-196-806","69","KEVIN J.

CONSERVATION EFFORTS LARGELY FOCUS ON PROVIDING FORAGE RESOURCES FOR BUMBLEBEES THROUGH THE SUMMER, BUT PROVIDING SUITABLE HABITAT DURING THE PERIOD OF NEST FOUNDATION IN EARLY SPRING COULD BE A MORE EFFECTIVE METHOD OF BOOSTING LOCAL BUMBLEBEE POPULATIONS. THIS STUDY ASSESSES THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THREE DIFFERENT FARMLAND HABITAT TYPES (HEDGEROW, FIELD MARGIN AND GRASSLAND), AND THE RELATIVE MERITS OF RESPECTIVE LAND MANAGEMENT PRESCRIPTIONS UNDER THE SCOTTISH RURAL STEWARDSHIP SCHEME TO NEST SITE SEARCHING AND FORAGING BUMBLEBEE QUEENS DURING THE PERIOD OF QUEEN EMERGENCE AND COLONY FOUNDATION. HEDGEROWS WERE THE LEAST ATTRACTIVE HABITAT TYPE TO SPRING QUEENS. RURAL STEWARDSHIP SPECIES-RICH GRASSLAND COMPRISED A COMPLEX VEGETATION STRUCTURE ATTRACTING NEST SITE SEARCHING QUEENS, WHILST GRASSLAND THAT HAD BEEN ABANDONED ALLOWING NATURAL REGENERATION CONTAINED MORE FLOWERS, ATTRACTING FORAGING QUEENS. FIELD MARGIN HABITATS WERE THE MOST ATTRACTIVE HABITAT TYPE, AND RURAL STEWARDSHIP FIELD MARGINS ATTRACTED BOTH NEST SITE SEARCHING AND FORAGING QUEENS AT RELATIVELY HIGH DENSITIES. THIS MANAGEMENT OPTION CONSISTED OF A SOWN GRASS MIX, GIVING RISE TO THE COMPLEX VEGETATION STRUCTURE PREFERRED BY NEST SITE SEARCHING QUEENS, BUT REGULAR DISTURBANCE ALLOWED INVASION BY EARLY FLOWERING BUMBLEBEE FORAGE PLANTS.

THE STRUCTURE OF THE HERBACEOUS COVER IN THE BUFFERS CHANGES OVER TIME. WHEN ROWS OF TREES ARE PRESENT, THE GRASS COVER IS DECREASED BY THE SHADING ACTION OF THE TREES, BUT THE LEAF LITTER GAINS IMPORTANCE. IN VFS WITH GRASS COVER ONLY, THE COVER COMPOSITION CHANGES BECAUSE OF THE SUBSTITUTION OF GRASS BY BROADLEAF SPECIES. SIX METRES WIDE VFS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING RUNOFF VOLUME AND CONCENTRATION DURING BOTH WET AND DRY YEARS. CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT RUNOFF CONCENTRATION AND VOLUME ARE LINKED TO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RAINFALL EVENT, BUFFER, SOURCE OF HERBICIDES AND TIME AFTER APPLICATION. REGRESSION ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS FOR RUNOFF VOLUME ARE RAINFALL AMOUNT AND INTENSITY, TOTAL VEGETAL COVER IN THE VFS, CROP LEAF AREA INDEX AND TIME AFTER TREATMENT; FOR CONCENTRATION THEY ARE RAINFALL INTENSITY, CROP LEAF AREA INDEX AND TOTAL VEGETAL COVER IN THE VFS. THE ROLE OF VFS IS COMPLEX, SO APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ITS INCREASING FILTERING CAPACITY OVER TIME.","71","1","74","82","INFILTRATION (HYDROLOGY); PLANT COVER; LEAF AREA INDEX; TERBUTHYLAZINE; METOLACHLOR; FILTER STRIP; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; BUFFER STRIP; SURFACE RUNOFF; AGRONOMY; ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING","","FILTRATION; HERBICIDES/ISOLATION & PURIFICATION; PLANTS/METABOLISM; RAIN; REGRESSION ANALYSIS","HERBICIDES","","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18045643 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008Chmsp..71...74O/abstract https://core.ac.uk/display/53413590 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004565350701291X https://www.research.unipd.it/handle/11577/2270552","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.CHEMOSPHERE.2007.10.029","18045643","10.1016/j.chemosphere.2007.10.029","2072473680","","0","002-650-706-842-54X; 004-946-735-949-069; 012-264-524-522-980; 013-316-180-822-055; 017-329-056-922-292; 020-537-450-372-975; 021-655-763-861-159; 024-998-467-249-663; 025-131-472-929-81X; 028-034-500-501-517; 029-227-515-568-324; 034-195-159-242-383; 042-230-387-909-769; 044-327-313-877-518; 051-200-045-837-899; 052-589-530-283-548; 052-894-240-545-387; 064-662-281-730-944; 066-008-497-105-394; 079-562-504-772-874; 080-894-085-139-156; 083-528-691-484-522; 086-496-072-727-834; 094-049-137-663-313; 096-878-710-039-072; 103-148-967-328-600; 103-286-115-762-912; 104-230-077-662-702; 107-861-247-559-610; 111-288-588-656-115; 117-074-543-175-080; 128-195-997-346-382; 135-211-483-825-15X; 138-643-821-809-522; 142-092-889-852-638; 159-359-733-987-293; 181-090-792-931-175; 191-147-319-900-194","53","STEFAN OTTO; M.

(2001) FOR THE SCENIC BEAUTY ASSESSMENT. THE STUDY AREAS CONSISTED OF THREE ORIGINAL, UNTREATED, AND 15 MODIFIED RURAL LANDSCAPES REPRESENTING A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES. THE SCENIC BEAUTY OF THE LANDSCAPES WAS EVALUATED THROUGH PAIRWISE COMPARISONS OF THE RESPONSES OF 68 PEOPLE. FURTHERMORE, ATTITUDES TOWARDS ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES, WATER PROTECTION, BUFFER STRIPS AND SUBSIDIES TO AGRICULTURE WERE OBTAINED. THE RESPONDENTS FOUND THE MAINTAINED BUFFER STRIPS MORE PLEASING THAN UNMAINTAINED STRIPS AND CONSIDERED THAT THE QUALITY OF WATERCOURSES WAS INCREASED BY BUFFER STRIPS ALONG THEM. A SUITABLE WIDTH FOR THE BUFFER STRIP ALONG MAIN DITCHES, BROOKS AND WATERWAYS WAS REGARDED, ON AVERAGE, TO BE WIDER THAN THE CURRENT RECOMMENDATIONS. ALTHOUGH THE OPINIONS OF FARMERS WERE BASICALLY IN LINE WITH THE EXISTING RECOMMENDATIONS, FARMERS' OPININONS ON THE SECOND AND THIRD MOST IMPORTANT EFFECTS OF BUFFER STRIPS, AN INCREASE IN WEEDS AND A DECREASE IN CULTIVATED LAND, CLEARLY DIFFERED FROM THOSE OF THE OTHER RESPONDENTS. AFFORESTATION, LACK OF BUILDING MAINTENANCE AND ABANDONED FIELDS WERE CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IMPACTING RURAL LANDSCAPES.

GIVEN THESE PREMISES, A STUDY WAS DONE ON THE EASTERN PO PLAIN, IN A TRANSITION AREA BETWEEN THE TEMPERATE (EUROSIBERIAN) AND MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATIC ZONES, ADOPTING THE SAME SAMPLE SHAPE AND DIMENSIONS AS A NORTH-AMERICAN STUDY [CORBIT ET AL. (1999) J ECOL 87:220–232]. THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTIONS WERE POSED: (1) HOW COMMON ARE FOREST SPECIES IN HEDGEROWS? (2) DO ORIGIN, ISOLATION, DISTANCE FROM SOURCE, WIDTH AND ADJACENT LAND-USE FACTORS CORRELATE WITH THE FREQUENCY OF FOREST SPECIES? (3) ARE HEDGEROWS CORRIDORS FOR FOREST SPECIES? TO ADDRESS THESE, THREE FUNCTIONAL TYPES OF HEDGEROWS, IDENTIFIED BY COMPARING OLD AERIAL-PHOTOS, WERE SAMPLED: REMNANT ATTACHED (N = 12) AND REMNANT ISOLATED (N = 6) WITH RESPECT TO THE NEAREST WOODLAND AND REGENERATED ATTACHED (N = 4). IF WOODED PATCHES WERE A SOURCE FOR HEDGEROWS, THEN REGENERATED HEDGEROWS SHOULD BE MORE SIMILAR TO AN ADJACENT WOODLAND THAN AN ISOLATED REMNANT. A 900 M2 CIRCULAR PLOT IN WOODLANDS AND AN ADJACENT 90-M TRANSECT ALONG HEDGEROWS WERE SAMPLED FOR THE PRESENCE AND COVER OF ALL PLANT SPECIES, THEN 39 WOODLAND TAXA WERE SELECTED. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE THREE HEDGEROW TYPES EMERGED IN FOREST SPECIES RICHNESS, BUT NOT IN COVER. THE FOREST SPECIES COMPOSITION IN BOTH REMNANT AND REGENERATED ATTACHED HEDGEROWS SHOWED A STRONG AFFINITY WITH THE ADJACENT STAND, IMPLYING A DISPERSAL PROCESS FROM WOODLAND (SOURCE) TO REGENERATED HEDGEROWS (SINK). A DISTANCE EFFECT ON FOREST SPECIES DISTRIBUTION CLEARLY LINKED TO A CORRIDOR FUNCTION WAS FOUND ONLY IN REGENERATED HEDGEROWS, WHILE IN THE REMNANT ATTACHED ONES, EVEN WITH A COMPOSITION SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE NEAREST WOODLAND SOURCE, OTHER ADDITIONAL FACTORS CANNOT BE IGNORED TO EXPLAIN THE FINE SCALE DISTRIBUTION OF FOREST SPECIES. THE COVER OF THE MOST COMMON ANT-DISPERSED SPECIES SHOWED A SIMILAR DISTANCE EFFECT WHILE VERTEBRATE-DISPERSED ONES DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT TREND WITH DISTANCE FROM WOODLANDS. HABITAT SUITABILITY FOR FOREST SPECIES WAS AFFECTED BY WIDTH, ESPECIALLY IN HEDGES WIDER THAN 12 M, BUT NOT BY ADJACENT LAND USE.","188","2","235","252","BIODIVERSITY; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; ECOLOGY; WOODLAND; GEOGRAPHY; MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE; BIOLOGICAL DISPERSAL; SPECIES RICHNESS; TRANSECT; TEMPERATE CLIMATE","","","","","http://paduaresearch.cab.unipd.it/4406/ https://www.jstor.org/stable/40212890 https://www.jstor.org/stable/info/40212890 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11258-006-9159-7 http://paduaresearch.cab.unipd.it/4406/1/Sitzia_2007.pdf https://www.research.unipd.it/handle/11577/1776850 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11258-006-9159-7.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1007/S11258-006-9159-7","","10.1007/s11258-006-9159-7","2092468039","","0","009-635-796-421-843; 010-250-877-529-926; 010-491-073-636-58X; 018-023-127-841-209; 018-463-393-074-304; 019-678-192-960-072; 019-843-445-116-58X; 020-397-079-701-583; 023-187-218-601-114; 024-608-779-166-000; 026-524-247-263-808; 026-926-325-058-247; 029-166-097-649-722; 033-432-973-124-71X; 035-857-688-042-308; 036-681-752-627-926; 036-838-626-539-581; 037-025-174-020-76X; 037-918-730-170-24X; 040-004-831-914-831; 040-274-357-523-365; 042-721-756-492-134; 042-901-767-821-19X; 044-037-639-154-912; 046-559-721-405-224; 047-994-627-473-32X; 051-197-969-663-775; 053-441-336-748-650; 055-051-694-358-299; 057-001-477-328-971; 058-113-713-450-833; 061-507-800-670-287; 063-207-503-700-767; 068-143-605-669-192; 069-222-611-667-46X; 071-601-864-758-089; 072-975-105-883-930; 073-859-868-800-687; 079-034-689-238-707; 080-357-443-253-546; 081-559-066-309-760; 082-612-601-545-869; 089-627-402-193-481; 091-812-760-612-259; 092-815-192-924-456; 096-835-160-953-686; 098-571-819-798-087; 107-527-494-739-340; 108-857-223-056-60X; 109-162-269-116-845; 109-507-453-904-682; 110-115-299-576-037; 115-742-892-181-305; 116-485-763-851-01X; 120-419-248-919-613; 132-473-320-897-539; 156-624-196-949-616; 158-604-272-738-517; 165-123-901-414-731; 168-592-107-353-063; 176-543-809-298-678; 187-050-769-304-212","33","TOMMASO SITZIA","PLANT ECOLOGY","PLANT ECOLOGY","","LENS",0,"SITZIA T, 2006, PLANT ECOLOGY","SITZIA T, 2006, PLANT ECOLOGY"

THE STUDY WAS BASED ON THE COMPARISON OF TWO TRANSECTS, ONE WITH A HEDGE, THE OTHER WITHOUT, USING MAINLY A DENSE GRID OF TENSIOMETERS. THE INFLUENCE OF THE BOTTOMLAND HEDGE WAS LOCATED IN THE AREA WHERE TREE ROOTS WERE DEVELOPED, SEVERAL METRES UPSLOPE FROM THE HEDGE, AND COULD BE OBSERVED BOTH IN THE SATURATED AND NON-SATURATED ZONE, FROM MAY TO DECEMBER. THE HEDGE INDUCED A HIGH RATE OF SOIL DRYING, BECAUSE OF THE HIGH EVAPORATIVE CAPACITY OF THE TREES. WE EVALUATED THAT WATER UPTAKE BY THE HEDGE DURING THE GROWING SEASON WAS AT LEAST 100 MM HIGHER THAN WITHOUT A HEDGE. THIS INCREASED DRYING RATE LED TO A DELAYED REWETTING OF THE SOILS UPSLOPE FROM THE HEDGE IN AUTUMN, OF ABOUT 1 MONTH COMPARED WITH THE SITUATION WITHOUT A HEDGE. SEVERAL CONSEQUENCES OF THIS DELAYED REWETTING ARE EXPECTED: A DELAY IN THE RETURN OF SUBSURFACE TRANSFER FROM THE HILLSLOPE TO THE RIPARIAN ZONE, A BUFFERING EFFECT OF HEDGES ON FLOODS, ALREADY OBSERVED AT THE CATCHMENT SCALE, AND AN INCREASED RESIDENCE TIME OF POLLUTANTS.

A SET OF WEATHER STATIONS, SUPPLIED BY AMET- LITSCHMANN AND SUCHY VELKE BILOVICE, WAS USED FOR THE MEASURING. THE STATIONS MEASURED WIND VELOCITY (M/S), SOIL TEMPERATURE IN DEPTHS OF 5 AND 10 CM (°C), AIR TEMPERATURE (°C), RADIATION (W.M<JATS:SUP>-2</JATS:SUP>) AND PRECIPITATION (MM) FROM JANUARY 1 TO DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE IMAGETOOL APPLICATION WAS USED TO ESTABLISH OPTICAL POROSITY, BASED ON PHOTOS TAKEN IN SUMMER AND WINTER. OPTICAL POROSITY WAS ESTABLISHED AS A RATIO OF WHITE SPOTS TO THEIR TOTAL NUMBER IN A SPECIFIC SECTION OF A PHOTOGRAPH. THE OPTICAL POROSITY WAS 5% DURING THE GROWING SEASON AND 23% OUTSIDE THE GROWING SEASON.

DATE OF SILKING WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT PREDICTOR OF BIRD DAMAGE TO CORN; EARLIER MATURING FIELDS RECEIVED GREATER DAMAGE. A FIELD'S PEAK POPULATION OF NORTHERN CORN ROOTWORM BEETLES (DIABROTICA LONGICORNIS) WAS THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLE AND WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH BIRD DAMAGE. OTHER VARIABLES OF LESSER IMPORTANCE WERE THE EXTENT TO WHICH A FIELD WAS BORDERED BY WOODS AND HEDGEROWS AND THE FIELD'S WEEDINESS (BOTH POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH DAMAGE). HUSK EXTENSION PAST THE TIP OF A CORN EAR WAS ALWAYS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH BLACKBIRD DAMAGE WITHIN A GIVEN FIELD THAT RECEIVED HIGHER AMOUNTS OF BIRD DAMAGE. BECAUSE THIS VARIABLE WAS UNIMPORTANT IN EXPLAINING VARIATION IN DAMAGE AMONG FIELDS, HOWEVER, WE FEEL THAT RECOMMENDING THE USE OF CORN HYBRIDS WHOSE BIRD-RESISTANCE IS BASED PRIMARILY ON HUSK EXTENSION IS UNWARRANTED. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 49(4):1109-1115 ON A CONTINENT-WIDE BASIS, BLACKBIRD DAMAGE TO CORN IS NOT A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

THE EFFECT OF CONTROLLED DRAINAGE AND RIPARIAN BUFFERS AS BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO REDUCE THE LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL NONPOINT SOURCE NITROGEN FROM THE MIDDLE COASTAL PLAIN HAS NOT BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED. THE MIDDLE COASTAL PLAIN IS CHARACTERIZED BY INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE ON SANDY SOILS WITH DEEPLY INCISED OR CHANNELIZED STREAMS. A 2-YEAR STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLLED DRAINAGE, RIPARIAN BUFFERS, AND A COMBINATION OF BOTH IN THE MIDDLE COASTAL PLAIN OF NORTH CAROLINA. IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT RAISING THE WATER TABLE NEAR THE DITCH WOULD ENHANCE NITRATE-NITROGEN REDUCTION THROUGH DENITRIFICATION. ON THE SANDY SOILS STUDIED, CONTROLLED DRAINAGE DID NOT EFFECTIVELY RAISE THE WATER TABLE NEAR THE DITCH TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN OBSERVED ON THE FREE DRAINAGE TREATMENT. DUE TO RANDOM TREATMENT LOCATION, THE FREE DRAINAGE TREATMENT WAS INSTALLED ALONG A DITCH WITH A SHALLOWER IMPERMEABLE LAYER COMPARED TO THE IMPERMEABLE LAYER ON THE CONTROLLED DRAINAGE TREATMENTS (2 M VERSUS 3- TO 4-M DEEP). THIS RESULTED IN A PERCHED OR HIGHER WATER TABLE ON THE FREE DRAINAGE TREATMENT. OVER 17 STORM EVENTS, THE RIPARIAN BUFFER (FREE DRAINAGE) TREATMENT HAD AN AVERAGE GROUNDWATER TABLE DEPTH OF 0.92 M COMPARED TO 0.96 AND 1.45 M FOR THE COMBINATION (RIPARIAN BUFFER AND CONTROLLED DRAINAGE) AND CONTROLLED DRAINAGE TREATMENTS, RESPECTIVELY. NITRATE CONCENTRATION DECREASE BETWEEN THE FIELD WELLS AND DITCH EDGE WELLS AVERAGED 29% (BUFFER ONLY), 63% (BUFFER AND CONTROLLED DRAINAGE), AND 73% (CONTROLLED DRAINAGE ONLY). ALTHOUGH APPARENTLY MORE NITRATE WAS REMOVED FROM THE GROUNDWATER ON THE CONTROLLED DRAINAGE TREATMENTS, THE CONTROLLED DRAINAGE TREATMENT WATER TABLE NEAR THE DITCH WAS NOT RAISED CLOSER TO THE GROUND SURFACE COMPARED TO THE FREE DRAINAGE TREATMENT. NITRATE REMOVAL EFFECTIVENESS WAS ATTRIBUTED TO LOCAL SOIL AND LANDSCAPE PROPERTIES, SUCH AS DENITRIFICATION IN DEEPER REDUCED ZONES OF THE SOIL PROFILE.","129","2","82","92","RIPARIAN ZONE; WATERTABLE CONTROL; RIPARIAN BUFFER; DITCH; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; WELL DRAINAGE; SOIL SALINITY CONTROL; DRAINAGE; HYDROLOGY (AGRICULTURE); ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING","","","","","https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/en/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=200902215427566879 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=323845 https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%290733-9437%282003%29129%3A2%2882%29","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9437(2003)129:2(82)","","10.1061/(asce)0733-9437(2003)129:2(82)","2065878749","","0","002-027-268-565-284; 002-509-409-482-215; 015-213-427-435-243; 015-514-563-181-208; 016-259-935-732-332; 016-886-654-276-361; 021-187-528-186-865; 023-842-569-989-956; 035-157-530-442-048; 040-665-244-257-257; 049-377-460-200-299; 060-049-553-153-247; 063-866-021-105-753; 067-935-774-027-528; 080-589-148-600-106; 087-138-533-405-771; 096-695-870-619-787; 100-845-850-323-114; 102-432-153-097-825; 103-989-366-241-549; 105-270-727-269-180; 123-754-328-151-613; 132-186-585-542-192; 134-860-865-497-079; 141-101-347-131-583; 150-539-908-471-485; 169-607-559-923-667; 173-787-454-724-990; 185-249-332-171-432","22","MICHAEL D.

MARGIN PLOTS WERE REGENERATED SPONTANEOUSLY OR WERE SOWN TO GRASS/FORB MIXTURES AND WERE MANAGED UNDER A CUTTING REGIME WITH REMOVAL OF CUTTINGS. IN GENERAL, SOIL NITRATE N, SOIL AMMONIUM N AND SOIL MINERAL N LOSSES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY DISTANCE FROM THE FIELD CROP EDGE AND NOT BY PLANT COMMUNITY TYPE.

INSIDE THE MARGIN STRIP, TOTAL SOIL MINERAL N AS WELL AS N LOSS DURING WINTER WAS MINIMAL AT A DISTANCE OF 5 M FROM THE CROP EDGE. THE REDUCTION OF SOIL NITRATE N NEAR THE BOUNDARY BY THE PRESENCE OF A MARGIN STRIP WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCREASE IN ABUNDANCE OF LESS COMPETITIVE SPECIES AND FOR AN UP TO 20% HIGHER SPECIES-RICHNESS WITHIN THE FIELD BOUNDARIES.

TO EXPLORE THE VARIABILITY OF RUNOFF RESPONSES, WE ANALYZED SURFACE RUNOFF HYDROGRAPHS FROM 12 NEIGHBORING HILLSLOPES IN CENTRAL IOWA, USA THAT WERE OBSERVED FOR 72 RUNOFF EVENTS OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD. THESE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENTAL HILLSLOPES RECEIVE VARIOUS PRAIRIE FILTER STRIP TREATMENTS AND DRAIN AREAS RANGING FROM 0.48 TO 3.19 HA. THE DISTANCES BETWEEN THEM VARY FROM TENS OF METERS TO ABOUT 3 KM. WE COMPARED THE HYDROGRAPHS FROM THE REMAINING 11 HILLSLOPES TO THE HYDROGRAPH AT THE BENCHMARK HILLSLOPE (I.E., HILLSLOPE B6 WITH NO TREATMENT). THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT: (1) FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL EVENT IN WHICH NOTICEABLE SURFACE RUNOFF OCCURRED, THE HYDROGRAPHS FROM THESE HILLSLOPES HAD SIMILAR SHAPES BUT DIFFERENT MAGNITUDES; (2) FOR ANY PAIRED HILLSLOPES, THE SHAPE SIMILARITY PERSISTED, BUT THE SCALING FACTOR (THE REGRESSION SLOPE BETWEEN TWO FLOW SERIES) CHANGED ACROSS EVENTS; AND (3) FOR ANY RUNOFF EVENT, NO SIMPLE RELATIONSHIP EXISTS BETWEEN THE SPATIAL VARIATION OF THE SCALING FACTOR AND THE SLOPE, SLOPE LENGTH, AREA, AND PRAIRIE STRIP WIDTH AT THE FOOTSLOPE OF THE HILLSLOPES. INTERESTINGLY, WE FOUND THAT FOR 9 OUT OF THE 11 PAIRED HILLSLOPES, 40–70% OF THE TEMPORAL VARIATION IN THE SCALING FACTORS CAN BE EXPLAINED BY THE ANTECEDENT WETNESS CONDITION AND THE MAXIMUM HOURLY RAIN ACCUMULATION. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE SMALL-SCALE SURFACE RUNOFF RESPONSES ARE SPATIALLY VARIABLE BUT ORGANIZED LINEARLY, I.E., SHAPE SIMILARITY (OR LINEARITY) IN SPACE IS ANOTHER FEATURE OF THE SMALL-SCALE RUNOFF PROCESS. THIS PHENOMENON SEEMS TO RESULT FROM THE SPATIAL VICINITY AND SMALL-SCALE SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF RAINFALL INTENSITY AND ANTECEDENT SOIL MOISTURE.","523","","1","13","RUNOFF CURVE NUMBER; HYDROLOGICAL MODELLING; HYDROGRAPH; COMMON SPATIAL PATTERN; RUNOFF MODEL; FILTER STRIP; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SURFACE RUNOFF; SPATIAL VARIABILITY","","","","CHINA SCHOLARSHIP COUNCIL","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169415000554 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015JHyd..523....1C/abstract https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153116389","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2015.01.038","","10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.01.038","2075751711","","0","004-465-624-036-972; 006-066-406-396-675; 006-329-950-846-598; 007-677-722-142-043; 008-320-326-223-348; 008-971-380-056-340; 009-780-396-180-412; 010-104-942-454-938; 011-493-172-373-290; 017-930-583-619-831; 019-676-561-924-896; 023-423-073-201-524; 029-742-050-023-063; 030-093-631-991-87X; 030-368-791-861-089; 031-529-836-604-491; 034-393-502-726-631; 036-372-523-897-245; 044-993-084-386-540; 046-140-235-164-24X; 048-106-086-853-933; 049-081-213-291-880; 049-847-868-261-232; 051-172-034-272-006; 052-133-234-984-053; 054-715-809-921-479; 055-192-571-710-917; 060-900-585-984-084; 063-521-010-406-506; 065-315-236-996-946; 067-069-254-382-35X; 067-533-754-673-731; 067-652-033-344-200; 067-705-506-184-662; 069-373-781-508-435; 069-473-047-149-720; 069-803-377-717-240; 070-431-249-324-267; 073-060-264-884-691; 079-233-446-576-041; 084-646-631-268-151; 086-621-201-433-227; 089-906-855-730-210; 092-843-881-158-062; 100-989-960-787-246; 101-486-167-877-192; 104-112-496-691-738; 115-327-011-925-661; 116-061-932-250-460; 119-271-226-592-492; 120-332-902-677-961; 121-638-852-965-268; 122-876-708-988-828; 138-659-345-103-997; 154-158-369-190-671; 159-041-181-557-542; 163-186-925-373-984; 164-778-477-702-099; 167-447-710-673-654; 168-888-939-226-270; 169-167-901-776-708; 171-887-276-660-079; 176-781-779-656-916; 176-965-602-042-093; 181-648-893-047-370; 186-799-475-314-560","3","BO CHEN; WITOLD F.

WHILST A LARGE NUMBER OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS HAVE FOCUSED ON NITRATE REMOVAL MECHANISMS, SUCH AS PLANT UPTAKE AND DENITRIFICATION MAXIMIZATION IN BUFFER ZONES, FEW HAVE STUDIED THE EFFECTS THAT DIFFERENT SOIL MANAGEMENT TREATMENTS HAVE ON DRAINAGE RATES. THE APPLICATION OF CHLORIDE TRACER TO SOILS UNDER SIX DIFFERENT VEGETATIVE TREATMENTS FROM TWO DIFFERING SOIL TEXTURES PRODUCED BREAKTHROUGH CURVES HIGHLIGHTING THE DOMINANT FLOW MECHANISMS FOR EACH MANAGEMENT PRACTICE. OF THE 18 BREAKTHROUGH TRACERS DETERMINED, 9 EXHIBITED A RAPID MACROPORE HYDROLOGY, 6 INTERMEDIATE MESOPORE THROUGH-FLOW AND THREE SLOW MICROPORE FLOW. SOLUTE BREAKTHROUGH FLOW RATE WAS SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN ALL VEGETATION AND SOIL TREATMENTS (P< 0.05), INDICATING THAT BOTH PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DETERMINATION OF DRAINAGE FLOW PATHWAYS AND TRANSPORT SPEED. VEGETATION SUCH AS SCRUB, WITH A LARGE ROOT NETWORK, LED TO INCREASED SOIL POROSITY, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY AND THE MAXIMUM PEAK DRAINAGE RATES OF THE SOIL. ON THE OTHER HAND, MAIZE AND GRASS TREATMENTS, WITH SMALLER AND LESS DENSE ROOT NETWORKS, EXHIBITED LOWER SOIL POROSITY AND HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY, INCREASING SOLUTE RESIDENCE TIME WITHIN THE SOIL MATRIX AND HENCE A LONGER LAG TIME TO PEAK EFFLUENT CONCENTRATION. ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE TREATMENTS ON EACH SOIL TEXTURE WERE DIFFERENT, AND SO COULD NOT BE DIRECTLY COMPARED, RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT OPTIMAL TREATMENTS WERE SOIL SPECIFIC, BUT THAT GRASSED AND MAIZE BUFFER STRIPS, ON A SOIL WITH LOW SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY, WOULD PROVIDE THE BEST COMPROMISE AT MITIGATING SOLUTE DRAINAGE WHILST MAINTAINING MANAGEMENT PRACTICALITY.","4","1","79","89","LEACHING (AGRICULTURE); LEACHING MODEL; SOIL SCIENCE; SOIL WATER; SOIL TEXTURE; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; BUFFER STRIP; MACROPORE; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; SOIL MANAGEMENT","","","","","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan_Helliwell/publication/257610486_An_assessment_of_the_nitrate_leaching_risk_for_different_buffer_strip_establishments/links/00b7d5257dca436ad1000000.pdf https://academic.oup.com/biohorizons/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/biohorizons/hzr010 https://paperity.org/p/34395859/an-assessment-of-the-nitrate-leaching-risk-for-different-buffer-strip-establishments https://academic.oup.com/biohorizons/article/4/1/79/239068 http://biohorizons.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/1/79.short","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1093/BIOHORIZONS/HZR010","","10.1093/biohorizons/hzr010","2167141367","","0","000-549-090-803-93X; 002-509-409-482-215; 005-938-835-135-552; 006-083-384-428-879; 006-149-152-327-090; 007-004-053-886-726; 007-562-317-521-197; 009-379-307-440-518; 009-734-707-902-332; 013-845-839-283-541; 020-145-060-372-619; 023-889-860-756-398; 024-953-196-350-874; 030-171-471-836-846; 032-534-854-350-184; 036-664-186-194-585; 036-691-351-087-147; 040-533-615-849-901; 043-174-752-205-093; 045-072-492-341-691; 046-281-752-876-770; 047-315-074-139-26X; 055-072-866-441-535; 057-761-750-960-591; 062-305-363-494-940; 075-513-523-284-853; 079-938-824-114-304; 087-273-309-280-750; 088-136-093-994-951; 095-263-397-244-602; 100-148-435-274-753; 101-119-554-728-109; 106-177-292-362-975; 106-728-665-320-283; 108-459-198-531-582; 108-516-754-439-890; 108-525-633-526-407; 111-435-647-398-863; 112-269-099-044-532; 116-056-662-262-050; 121-468-243-703-60X; 125-122-409-294-402; 129-369-314-834-031; 134-281-196-430-419; 141-101-347-131-583; 144-787-876-778-751; 145-679-514-567-429; 150-539-908-471-485; 168-227-494-191-408; 168-390-972-372-263; 169-535-456-005-169; 186-392-345-345-321; 187-955-281-261-673","3","JONATHAN R.

OBSERVATIONS WERE CONDUCTED IN THE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE OF WESTERN VOLHYNIA WITH FIELDS OF DIFFERENT LAND USE INTENSITY (A LARGE-SCALE FARMING SYSTEM AND SMALL TRADITIONAL ARABLE FIELDS). THE TOTAL LENGTH OF THE STUDIED STRUCTURES WAS 4760 M AND THE FOLLOWING FIVE CATEGORIES OF STRUCTURES WERE DISTINGUISHED: FIELD ROAD VERGES ADJACENT TO LARGE (1) AND SMALL FIELDS (2), FIELD MARGINS BETWEEN THE PATCHES OF XEROTHERMIC GRASSLANDS AS WELL AS LARGE (3) OR SMALL FIELDS (4) AND BALKS (5). THE DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF SPECIES MENTIONED ABOVE WERE RECORDED THERE.

THE MOBILITY OF POLLINATING ANIMALS IS SIGNIFICANT TO THEIR IMPORTANCE BUT WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT HOW LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE INFLUENCES POLLINATOR MOVEMENTS. LINEAR LANDSCAPE FEATURES SUCH AS HEDGEROWS AND EMBANKMENTS ARE CONSPICUOUS FEATURES OF AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AND ARE IMPORTANT ARTIFICIAL HABITATS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT. HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN SOME DEBATE AS TO THE FUNCTION OF THESE LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS AS CORRIDORS BETWEEN LARGER EXPANSES OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT SEPARATED BY URBAN AND AGRICULTURAL HABITATS. FEW STUDIES HAVE SPECIFICALLY STUDIED INSECT FLIGHT RESPONSES TO LINEAR LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS. BY OBSERVING BUMBLEBEE FLIGHT BEHAVIOUR ALONG HEDGEROWS AND, BY CREATING A MEDIUM-SCALE EXPERIMENTAL ARRAY OF FLOWER PATCHES USING AN ARTIFICIAL LINEAR FEATURE, WE EXAMINED WHETHER SUCH STRUCTURES CAN ELICIT AN ORIENTED FLIGHT RESPONSE ALONG THEM AND THEREFORE FACILITATE INSECT MOVEMENT THROUGH THE LANDSCAPE. WE FOUND THAT BOTH HEDGEROWS AND ARTIFICIAL LINEAR LANDSCAPE FEATURES CAN INFLUENCE THE FLIGHT DIRECTIONS OF BUMBLEBEES (BOMBUS SPP. HYMENOPTERA, APIDAE), ONE OF EUROPE’S MOST IMPORTANT GROUPS OF POLLINATORS. A BIOASSAY EXPERIMENT IN WHICH SALVIA PRATENSIS (LAMIACEAE) WAS PLANTED INTO LANDSCAPE PATCHES WITH DIFFERING NUMBERS OF CONNECTING HEDGEROWS SHOWED THAT THIS DIRECTIONAL RESPONSE CAN HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS – PLANTS HAD INCREASED POLLINATOR ACTIVITY, POLLEN RECEIPT AND SUBSEQUENT SEED SET IN PATCHES WITH MORE CONNECTIONS.

UNCROPPED FIELD MARGINS ARE IMPORTANT FORAGING HABITATS ON FARMLAND FOR MANY DECLINING BIRD SPECIES AND ARE A KEY COMPONENT OF AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES ACROSS EUROPE. MAXIMIZING THE VALUE OF FORAGING HABITATS REQUIRES DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HABITAT SELECTION AND FOOD AVAILABILITY. 2. WE FIRSTLY CONDUCTED AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY OF FORAGING HABITAT SELECTION BY BREEDING YELLOWHAMMERS EMBERIZA CITRINELLA L. ON LOWLAND MIXED FARMLAND, IN RELATION TO UNDERLYING INVERTEBRATE AND VEGETATION CHARACTERISTICS. 3. THERE WAS A CLEAR SEASONAL SHIFT IN THE RELATIVE USE OF FIELD MARGINS AND CEREAL CROPS. MARGINS WERE USED LESS THAN CROPS IN LATE SUMMER, DESPITE SUPPORTING HIGHER INVERTEBRATE ABUNDANCE RELATIVE TO CEREALS. SEASONAL INCREASES IN VEGETATION HEIGHT WERE MOST MARKED IN MARGINS, SUGGESTING THE SEASONAL DECLINE IN MARGIN USE MAY REFLECT REDUCED FOOD ACCESSIBILITY. 4. IN THE SECOND PHASE OF THE STUDY, FIELD MARGINS WERE CUT EXPERIMENTALLY TO CREATE SHORT, OPEN PATCHES WITHIN TALLER MARGIN SWARDS. THE USE OF CUT PATCHES BY FORAGING YELLOWHAMMERS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN EARLY AND LATE SUMMER, AND PATCHES WERE USED MORE FREQUENTLY WITH INCREASING HEIGHT OF ADJACENT UNCUT MARGIN. THESE FINDINGS STRONGLY SUPPORT THE THEORY THAT TALL VEGETATION REDUCES MARGIN ACCESSIBILITY IN LATE SUMMER. 5. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. PROVISION OF INVERTEBRATE-RICH FIELD MARGINS IS A CORE COMPONENT OF AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES, BUT CURRENT PRESCRIPTIONS MAY RESULT IN THEM HAVING LIMITED VALUE IN LATE SUMMER. MORE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT, SUCH AS MORE FREQUENT CUTTING, MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS FOR FORAGING BIRDS BY CREATING SHORT, OPEN VEGETATION PATCHES. MEASURES TO INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY TO INVERTEBRATES ON FARMLAND ARE LIKELY TO BENEFIT A RANGE OF BIRD SPECIES ACROSS A VARIETY OF CROP TYPES.","46","2","353","362","FORAGING; VEGETATION; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; RANGE (BIOLOGY); GEOGRAPHY; GRASSLAND; AGRICULTURAL LAND; SPECIES RICHNESS; ABUNDANCE (ECOLOGY)","","","","","https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093095982 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01613.x/full https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01613.x https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20093095982.html https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juliet_Vickery/publication/229475730_Improving_the_value_of_field_margins_as_foraging_habitat_for_farmland_birds/links/5416cafe0cf2bb7347db7286.pdf https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01613.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01613.x","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1365-2664.2009.01613.X","","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01613.x","2002467839","","0","002-900-720-944-007; 003-251-732-418-644; 005-068-000-072-681; 014-373-326-060-805; 015-691-707-399-917; 018-345-804-742-85X; 028-955-327-048-080; 029-705-760-353-953; 030-831-977-852-027; 032-390-963-080-355; 036-556-226-795-548; 040-889-337-784-868; 044-307-871-990-779; 048-449-850-493-123; 053-787-579-034-941; 060-114-103-966-089; 064-454-510-982-621; 067-557-731-400-673; 068-452-604-669-157; 069-379-822-515-162; 073-935-983-022-480; 074-793-529-288-006; 079-051-208-482-165; 080-139-567-968-521; 080-917-805-094-419; 080-930-934-258-236; 094-746-201-098-704; 116-622-350-649-17X; 119-268-869-323-408; 124-362-582-173-520; 125-995-631-935-63X; 126-051-353-473-137; 126-125-162-266-054; 132-380-117-709-640; 133-858-248-195-498; 143-273-453-722-006; 145-728-200-767-581; 149-200-651-727-319; 165-804-108-473-473; 179-048-991-295-983","111","DAVID J.

ALTHOUGH THE ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF BUFFER VEGETATION ARE WELL ESTABLISHED BY PLOT- AND FIELD-SCALE RESEARCH, BUFFER ADOPTION BY FARMERS IS LIMITED. LANDSCAPE-SCALE APPROACHES CAN ADDRESS SEVERAL OBSTACLES BY SIMULTANEOUSLY CONSIDERING ECOLOGICAL IMPACT, ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY, AND AESTHETIC QUALITY AND PREFERENCE IN BUFFER PLACEMENT AND DESIGN. WITHIN FOUR WATERSHEDS OF WASHINGTON’S PALOUSE FARMING REGION, WE EXAMINED RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ECOLOGICAL AND AESTHETIC RESPONSES TO THE EXISTING LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE PLUS THREE ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS, DIFFERENTIATED BY SUCCESSIVE INCREASES IN WOODY BUFFERS. METHODOLOGY COMBINED GIS ANALYSIS, DIGITAL IMAGE SIMULATION, SOIL EROSION MODELING AND MAPPING, AND A LANDSCAPE PREFERENCE SURVEY. LANDSCAPE ECOLOGICAL FUNCTION, MEASURED BY EROSION AND DEPOSITION RATES, IMPROVED AS BUFFER ELEMENTS WERE ADDED INTO EACH SUCCESSIVE SCENARIO. MAGNITUDE OF IMPROVEMENTS VARIED AMONG SCENARIOS AND AMONG WATERSHEDS, REVEALING OPPORTUNITIES FOR TARGETING BUFFERS TO MAXIMIZE ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS AND ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY. CONCURRENTLY, AESTHETIC PREFERENCE, MEASURED AS SCENIC QUALITY RATINGS, INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.05) FROM THE EXISTING LANDSCAPE THROUGH THE SECOND SUCCESSIVE SCENARIO OF IMPROVED ECOLOGICAL FUNCTION. NO PREFERENCE DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE SECOND AND THIRD SCENARIOS. RESULTS EXPAND CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF MULTIFUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES AND ENCOURAGE FUTURE RESEARCH ON WHETHER LINKING ECOLOGICAL AND AESTHETIC QUALITY IN BUFFER DESIGN MIGHT FAVORABLY INFLUENCE ADOPTION.

CONCERN ABOUT THE PUTATIVE IMPACTS OF THIS PRACTICE ON LOCAL WATERS RESULTED IN A COLLECTION OF STUDIES TO: (1) DETERMINE THE SENSITIVITY OF EARLY LIFE STAGES OF BIVALVES TO COPPER, A COMMONLY USED FUNGICIDE; (2) EXAMINE ACUTE AND CHRONIC BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF RUNOFF ON TIDAL CREEKS; AND (3) EXAMINE THE EFFICACY OF MANAGEMENT PRACTICES DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE DELIVERY OF PESTICIDES TO ADJACENT CREEKS.

POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LANDSCAPE COMPLEXITY AND BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL IS NOW WELL KNOWN AND IS ASSUMED TO MAINLY COME FROM THE FACT THAT NATURAL ENEMIES USE SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS FOR OVERWINTERING. HOWEVER, THE RESPECTIVE ROLE OF EACH TYPE OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS IN THE LANDSCAPE IN SHAPING NATURAL ENEMY COMMUNITIES AND PEST CONTROL REMAINS POORLY STUDIED. MOREOVER, THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES IN STRUCTURING THESE COMMUNITIES REMAINS LARGELY UNEXPLORED. THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO PROVIDE AN INSIGHT INTO THE TYPES OF SNH NATURAL ENEMIES USE FOR OVERWINTERING AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS IN STRUCTURING THEIR OVERWINTERING COMMUNITIES. OVERWINTERING NATURAL ENEMY COMMUNITIES WERE SAMPLED IN 7 TYPES OF SNH (I.E., FOREST INTERIOR (FI), SOUTH-FACING FOREST EDGE (FES), NORTH-FACING FOREST EDGE (FEN), DRY UNMANAGED GRASSLAND (UGD), WET UNMANAGED GRASSLAND (UGW), MANAGED GRASS STRIP (CAP GRASS STRIP) EITHER DOMINATED BY MONOCOTYLEDONOUS PLANTS (MGM) OR BY DICOTYLEDONOUS PLANTS (MGD)). ABUNDANCE, SPECIES RICHNESS AS WELL AS COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OF EACH GROUP OF ENEMIES WERE THEN EXPLAINED BY LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE PARAMETERS TO ASSESS THEIR RELATIVE IMPORTANCE. IN OUR STUDY, OVERWINTERING NATURAL ENEMY COMMUNITIES DIFFERED MARKEDLY AMONG TYPES OF SNH. EXPLANATORY VARIABLES PROVED TO HAVE A DECREASING INFLUENCE IN SHAPING NATURAL ENEMY COMMUNITY COMPOSITIONS FROM THE LOCAL (I.E. IN THE EMERGENCE TRAP PERIMETER, IN 3 M- AND 15 M-RADIUS CIRCULAR ZONES AROUND IT) TO THE IMMEDIAT LANDSCAPE (WITHIN 30 M- AND 60 M-RADIUS CIRCULAR ZONES) AND THEN THE MID-DISTANT ONE (WITHIN 120 M-, 250 M- AND 500 M-RADIUS CIRCULAR ZONES). WE PARTICULARLY FOUND THAT MANAGEMENT INTENSITY AND VEGETATION HEIGHT WERE VERY STRONG DRIVERS OF NATURAL ENEMY DIVERSITY AT THE LOCAL SCALE. MANAGED CAP GRASS STRIPS TURNED OUT AS THE MAIN SOURCE HABITAT OF BENEFICIALS IN THE SPRING WHILE FORESTS ACTED QUITE NEGATIVELY ON LOCAL ABUNDANCES OF MOST OF THE BENEFICIALS STUDIED. ON THE OPPOSITE, MEDIUM ARABLE LAND AND GRASSLAND SURFACE AREAS PROVED TO BE FAVOURABLE FOR THEM AS A WHOLE IN THE IMMEDIAT LANDSCAPE, WHILE IN THE MID-DISTANT LANDSCAPE, FALLOWS FAVOURED APHIDOPHAGOUS HOVERFLIES AND ARABLE LANDS DID SO FOR SPIDERS. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR A MORE PRECISE DESCRIPTION OF SNH IN THE LANDSCAPE IF WE ARE TO MECHANISTICALLY UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF COMPOSITIONAL LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY ON ZOOPHAGOUS ARTHROPOD POPULATIONS AND TO GIVE RELEVANT GUIDELINES TO DESIGN LANDSCAPES FAVOURING NATURAL BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL.","194","","17","28","HABITAT; ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; GRASSLAND; OVERWINTERING; NATURAL (ARCHAEOLOGY); SPECIES RICHNESS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ARABLE LAND; ABUNDANCE (ECOLOGY)","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880914002242 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880914002242","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.AGEE.2014.04.018","","10.1016/j.agee.2014.04.018","2017699807","","0","001-261-565-923-219; 004-472-145-506-143; 008-225-619-668-580; 009-909-414-518-97X; 011-508-246-956-659; 013-439-054-708-024; 013-526-378-431-354; 014-475-770-713-515; 014-953-363-120-759; 016-052-929-723-298; 016-823-705-101-257; 017-516-181-294-137; 021-933-113-017-949; 025-990-754-410-325; 029-433-936-125-211; 029-476-222-336-498; 029-540-327-546-890; 030-012-917-796-79X; 030-605-654-781-361; 040-463-440-362-905; 042-765-344-128-744; 051-586-492-600-425; 053-121-575-080-691; 056-892-041-411-85X; 056-892-630-404-500; 057-326-824-587-341; 057-898-374-057-282; 058-105-561-757-413; 062-036-445-726-722; 063-141-893-182-571; 064-638-334-902-296; 069-901-245-663-534; 070-573-740-499-634; 074-793-529-288-006; 076-863-055-982-955; 087-520-578-895-249; 090-479-535-234-324; 091-265-753-392-171; 091-563-882-813-329; 094-448-753-890-34X; 096-920-887-442-138; 097-095-789-567-42X; 097-540-703-901-873; 109-691-661-850-685; 111-528-391-156-029; 113-124-060-953-420; 113-365-099-387-283; 122-154-985-613-384; 122-505-864-826-289; 122-528-143-728-138; 126-322-219-192-539; 126-812-080-751-085; 137-124-485-341-72X; 140-473-846-131-917; 142-547-556-180-595; 148-203-562-421-657; 150-325-162-873-23X; 192-923-404-596-807; 196-310-671-741-320","70","JEAN-PIERRE SARTHOU; ARIANE BADOZ; BERNARD E.

WE RELATE BRITISH FARMLAND BIRD ABUNDANCE AT THE 1 KM SQUARE SCALE TO THREE VARIABLE SETS: LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION (FOR EXAMPLE, AREAS OF WOODLAND, URBAN AND ARABLE), FIELD BOUNDARY CHARACTERISTICS AND CROPPING. WE THEN USE MULTI-MODEL INFERENCE TO SUMMARIZE MODEL FITS FOR EACH VARIABLE SET AND COMPARE THEIR EXPLANATORY POWER TO IDENTIFY THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE THREE FORMS OF DESCRIPTION OF THE FARM LANDSCAPE. THE IMPORTANT VARIABLES ACROSS SPECIES WITHIN EACH SET SHOW THE HABITAT FEATURES THAT ARE MOST SIGNIFICANT FOR THE FARMLAND BIRD COMMUNITY.; ; MODELS COMPRISING LANDSCAPE VARIABLES PROVIDED THE BEST FITS FOR 21 OF 31 BIRD SPECIES, WHILE FIELD BOUNDARY VARIABLES WERE MOST IMPORTANT FOR SEVEN SPECIES AND CROPPING VARIABLES FOR ONE. AFTER CONTROLLING FOR LANDSCAPE INFLUENCES, WE THEN FOUND THAT FIELD BOUNDARY VARIATION WAS SLIGHTLY MORE INFLUENTIAL THAN CROPPING. THESE PATTERNS REMAINED WHEN FARMLAND-SPECIALIST SPECIES WERE CONSIDERED ALONE. THIS SHOWS THAT LANDSCAPES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF BIRD ABUNDANCE AND THAT CROPPING PATTERNS AND FIELD BOUNDARY CHARACTERISTICS ARE INFLUENTIAL ONLY WITHIN THE CONSTRAINTS OF LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE. HOWEVER, BOUNDARIES AND, ESPECIALLY, CROPS REMAIN IMPORTANT FROM A MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE VOLATILE, AND CAN STILL DRIVE POPULATION CHANGE. IMPORTANT SINGLE VARIABLES THAT AFFECTED MULTIPLE SPECIES INCLUDED WOODLAND (PREDOMINANTLY NEGATIVE EVEN WITHIN FARMLAND-DOMINATED LANDSCAPES), HEDGES WITH TREES (PROVIDING NESTING HABITAT AND SONG-POSTS) AND HETEROGENEITY BOTH OF LANDSCAPES AND OF CROPPING (PREDOMINANTLY POSITIVE EFFECTS).

ONE METHOD OF REDUCING EXCESS NUTRIENT RUNOFF FROM NON-POINT SOURCES IS TO RESTORE OR ENHANCE EXISTING RIPARIAN AREAS AS VEGETATIVE BUFFERS. A FIELD SCALE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO ASSESS THE ABILITY OF REMNANT GIANT CANE (ARUNDINARIA GIGANTEA (WALT.) MUHL.) AND FOREST RIPARIAN BUFFER ZONES TO ATTENUATE NUTRIENTS IN AGRICULTURAL SURFACE RUNOFF FROM NATURAL PRECIPITATION EVENTS. TWO ADJACENT, 10.0 M WIDE RIPARIAN BUFFERS WERE INSTRUMENTED WITH 16 OVERLAND FLOW COLLECTORS TO MONITOR SURFACE RUNOFF FOR NITRATE, AMMONIUM, AND ORTHOPHOSPHATE. MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN AT 3.3 M INCREMENTS WITHIN EACH BUFFER. THE FOREST BUFFER SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED INCOMING DISSOLVED NITRATE-N, DISSOLVED AMMONIUM-N, TOTAL AMMONIUM-N, AND TOTAL ORTHOPHOSPHATE MASSES IN SURFACE RUNOFF BY 97, 74, 68, AND 78 , RESPECTIVELY WITHIN THE 10.0 M RIPARIAN BUFFER. NUTRIENT REDUCTIONS WITHIN THE CANE BUFFER WERE 100 FOR ALL THREE NUTRIENTS DUE TO RELATIVELY HIGH INFILTRATION RATES. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS OF TOTAL AMMONIUM- N AND TOTAL ORTHOPHOSPHATE WERE DETECTED BY 3.3 M IN THE CANE BUFFER AND AT 6.6 M IN THE FOREST BUFFER.

THIS STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO DISCERN THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT HERBACEOUS COVER TYPES ON TREE GROWTH AND SURVIVAL WHEN INTERPLANTED. LADINO CLOVER ( TRIFOLIUM REPENS L.) AND ORCHARDGRASS ( DACTYLIS GLOMERATA L.) WERE SOWN AND SEEDLINGS OF THREE TREE SPECIES, GREEN ASH ( FRAXINUS PENNSYLVANICA MARSH.), BLACK WALNUT ( JUGLANS NIGRA L.), AND RED OAK ( QUERCUS RUBRA L.)

A SERIES OF PLOTS CONTAINING THE NATIVE MIX OF ANNUAL AND PERENNIAL WEED SPECIES WAS USED AS A CONTROL. HEIGHT AND STEM CALIPER OF THE TREES WERE TAKEN FOR 4 YEARS. ADDITIONALLY, HABITAT QUALITY FOR BIRD SPECIES WAS ASSESSED WITH RESPECT TO THE CORN ( ZEA MAYS L.) CROP THE FILTER STRIPS REPLACED. RESULTS INDICATED THAT COVER TYPE HAD LITTLE INFLUENCE ON TREE GROWTH AND SURVIVAL WHEN WEED CONTROL ADJACENT TO SEEDLINGS WAS EFFECTIVE. COMPARED WITH THE NATIVE WEED POPULATION, CLOVER AND GRASS COVERS ALLOWED EQUAL HEIGHT GROWTH OF TREES, PROVIDING NO GREATER COMPETITION BUT HIGHER MANAGEMENT COSTS. FOR HABITAT QUALITY, FILTER STRIPS PROVIDED BETTER HABITAT FOR BIRDS WHEN COMPARED WITH CORN.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK WAS TO ASSESS THE VFS EFFICIENCY AND EVALUATE THE UNCERTAINTY IN PREDICTING THE MICROBIAL POLLUTANT REMOVAL FROM OVERLAND FLOW IN VFS. WE USED THE KINEMATIC WAVE OVERLAND FLOW MODEL AS IMPLEMENTED IN KINEROS2 COUPLED WITH THE CONVECTIVE-DISPERSIVE OVERLAND TRANSPORT MODEL WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THE REVERSIBLE ATTACHMENT-DETACHMENT AND SURFACE STRAINING OF INFILTRATING BACTERIA. THE MODEL WAS SUCCESSFULLY CALIBRATED WITH EXPERIMENTAL DATA OBTAINED FROM A SERIES OF SIMULATED RAINFALL EXPERIMENTS AT VEGETATED AND BARE SANDY LOAM AND CLAY LOAM PLOTS, WHERE FECAL COLIFORMS WERE RELEASED FROM MANURE SLURRY APPLIED ON THE TOP OF THE PLOTS. THE CALIBRATED MODEL WAS THEN USED TO ASSESS THE SENSITIVITY OF THE VFS EFFICIENCY TO THE MODEL PARAMETERS, RAINFALL DURATION, AND INTENSITY FOR A CASE STUDY WITH A 6-M VFS PLACED AT THE EDGE OF 200-M LONG FIELD. THE MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS WERE ALSO PERFORMED TO EVALUATE THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE VFS EFFICIENCY GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE MODEL PARAMETERS AND KEY INPUTS. THE VFS EFFICIENCY WAS FOUND TO BE <95% IN 25%, <75% IN 23%, AND <25% IN 20% OF CASES. RELATIVELY LONG HIGH-INTENSITY RAINFALLS, LOW HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITIES, LOW NET CAPILLARY DRIVES OF SOIL, AND HIGH SOIL MOISTURE CONTENTS BEFORE RAINFALLS CAUSED THE PARTIAL FAILURE OF VFS TO RETAIN COLIFORMS FROM THE INFILTRATION EXCESS RUNOFF.","38","4","1636","1644","LOAM; INFILTRATION (HYDROLOGY); WATER CONTENT; WATER QUALITY; FILTER STRIP; HYDROLOGY; MANURE; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SURFACE RUNOFF; SURFACE WATER","","CALIBRATION; ENTEROBACTERIACEAE/ISOLATION & PURIFICATION; MODELS, THEORETICAL; MONTE CARLO METHOD; PLANTS; UNCERTAINTY; WATER MICROBIOLOGY","","","https://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/ad_hoc/12655300EnvironmentalTransport/STWIR_reprints/jeq-38-4-1636.pdf https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/38/4/1636 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2008.0328 https://msu.edu/~akguber/files/STWIR/jeq-38-4-1636.pdf https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80420525/EnvironmentalTransport/STWIR_reprints/jeq-38-4-1636.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19549940 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/19549940 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/download/31757/PDF https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093247011 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/31757","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.2134/JEQ2008.0328","19549940","10.2134/jeq2008.0328","1994634509","","0","000-073-950-100-003; 000-473-351-643-13X; 000-521-240-880-638; 001-168-995-099-307; 007-850-000-698-097; 011-751-968-011-964; 013-446-432-560-502; 017-171-643-071-851; 020-188-845-767-450; 024-686-342-544-391; 026-434-734-570-195; 032-226-381-470-99X; 033-881-668-870-349; 038-580-087-999-964; 041-734-577-789-422; 053-514-836-557-388; 055-204-862-812-935; 055-488-793-301-441; 064-560-673-923-65X; 064-655-278-564-572; 066-714-492-024-42X; 067-559-517-600-50X; 070-377-273-331-446; 076-436-701-138-403; 076-826-572-086-275; 103-154-083-684-408; 105-796-662-135-478; 111-288-588-656-115; 112-700-431-523-654; 115-460-127-924-989; 127-751-427-061-826; 128-320-740-075-409; 148-511-377-828-599; 151-498-245-092-772; 151-755-829-769-77X; 166-604-449-988-782; 172-848-836-166-883; 182-906-730-748-020; 195-277-143-877-584","36","ANDREY K.

TO STUDY HABITAT EFFECTS ON THE EASTERN WOODRAT (NEOTOMAFLORIDANA), WE SURVEYED NESTS OF THE EASTERN WOODRAT IN WOODLANDS, GRASSLANDS, AND CROPLANDS ALONG 77 KM OF SECONDARY ROADS IN THREE COUNTIES IN NORTH-CENTRAL KANSAS. ALL NESTS WERE LOCATED IN WOODLANDS (~2% OF HABITAT), ALTHOUGH GRASSLANDS AND CROPLANDS CONSTI- TUTED 36% AND 62% OF HABITAT SURVEYED, RESPECTIVELY. IN OUR SURVEY, NESTS WERE ASSOCIATED POSITIVELY WITH SHELTERBELTS (3.6 NESTS PER 100 M OF ROAD EDGE) BUT NOT WITH SHRUB PATCHES (1.1 NESTS PER 100 M OF ROAD EDGE) OR RIPARIAN WOODLANDS (0.3 NESTS PER 100 M OF ROAD EDGE). CONSEQUENTLY, WE SPECIFICALLY CENSUSED NESTS IN AN ADDITIONAL 12 RIPARIAN WOODLANDS AND 12 SHELTERBELTS. NESTS OF EASTERN WOODRATS WERE LESS DENSE IN RIPARIAN WOOD- LANDS (9.4 NESTSLHA) THAN IN SHELTERBELTS (55.5 NESTSLHA). DENSITY OF WOODRAT NESTS DECREASED AS WIDTH OF A WOODED AREA INCREASED. FURTHER, NESTS PER 100 M OF LENGTH OF WOODLAND DID NOT INCREASE AS THE WIDTH OF WOODLAND INCREASED. THESE PATTERNS SUGGEST THAT WOODLAND EDGE, NOT WOODLAND INTERIOR, IS THE PRIMARY FACTOR IN ABUNDANCE OF EASTERN WOODRATS IN THIS REGION. ALTHOUGH THE EASTERN WOODRAT HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN CONSID- ERED A WOODLAND SPECIES, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THIS ASSESSMENT IS INCORRECT. OUR OBSERVATIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT ANTHROPOGENIC MODIFICA- TION OF THE GREAT PLAINS, IN THE FORM OF PLANTED SHELTERBELTS AND EXPANDED RIPARIAN WOODLAND, LIKELY HAS INCREASED THE DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF EASTERN WOODRATS, COMPARED TO THE MID-1800S.

BUFFER STRIPS AND MANAGED INTENSIVE ROTATIONAL GRAZING (MIRG) HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO PROTECT AND RESTORE STREAM ECOSYSTEMS IN WISCONSIN. HOWEVER, THE ECOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF A SWITCH FROM TRADITIONAL LIVESTOCK MANAGEMENT TO MIRG OR BUFFER STRIP ESTABLISHMENT HAVE NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED. DIFFERENCES IN SMALL MAMMAL COMMUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH RIPARIAN AREAS ON CONTINUOUSLY GRAZED AND MIRG PASTURES, AS WELL AS VEGETATIVE BUFFER STRIPS ADJACENT TO ROW CROPS, WERE INVESTIGATED IN SOUTHWESTERN WISCONSIN DURING MAY–SEPTEMBER 1997 AND 1998. MORE SPECIES (MEAN OF 6–7) WERE FOUND ON THE BUFFER SITES THAN ON THE PASTURE SITES (MEAN OF 2–5). TOTAL SMALL MAMMAL ABUNDANCE ON BUFFER SITES WAS GREATER THAN ON THE PASTURES AS WELL; THERE WERE 3–5 TIMES AS MANY ANIMALS ON THE BUFFER SITES COMPARED TO THE PASTURE SITES, DEPENDING ON YEAR. THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN SPECIES RICHNESS OR TOTAL ABUNDANCE BETWEEN MIRG AND CONTINUOUSLY GRAZED PASTURES IN EITHER YEAR. TOTAL SMALL MAMMAL ABUNDANCE WAS GREATER NEAR THE STREAM THAN AWAY FROM THE STREAM, REGARDLESS OF FARM MANAGEMENT PRACTICE BUT THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN SPECIES RICHNESS. BUFFER STRIPS APPEAR TO SUPPORT A PARTICULARLY RICH AND ABUNDANT SMALL MAMMAL COMMUNITY. ALTHOUGH RESULTS DID NOT DETECT A DIFFERENCE IN SMALL MAMMAL USE BETWEEN PASTURE TYPES, FARM-WIDE IMPLICATIONS OF A CONVERSION FROM CONTINUOUS TO MIRG STYLES OF GRAZING MAY BENEFIT SMALL MAMMALS INDIRECTLY BY CAUSING AN INCREASE IN THE PREVALENCE OF PASTURE IN THE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE.","88","1","49","59","RIPARIAN ZONE; ECOLOGY; MANAGED INTENSIVE ROTATIONAL GRAZING; GRAZING; BUFFER ZONE; PASTURE; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; BUFFER STRIP; SPECIES RICHNESS; ABUNDANCE (ECOLOGY)","","","","","https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usgsstaffpub/522/ http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1531&context=usgsstaffpub https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70024891 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880901001542","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/S0167-8809(01)00154-2","","10.1016/s0167-8809(01)00154-2","2006547533","","0","005-073-055-538-326; 010-083-294-693-008; 012-338-039-886-640; 014-322-432-919-02X; 018-982-083-333-790; 026-652-453-307-433; 028-455-082-855-472; 029-067-159-542-004; 034-461-301-281-56X; 035-093-656-083-327; 040-198-568-662-726; 051-751-437-557-117; 052-407-380-233-819; 057-191-112-701-980; 059-573-097-010-175; 062-840-277-915-897; 063-314-964-834-008; 064-592-044-575-740; 068-824-335-098-900; 068-997-932-046-194; 073-466-062-049-161; 075-781-408-578-136; 077-260-437-651-741; 080-104-280-558-672; 083-292-483-412-825; 090-434-065-856-305; 105-658-519-498-107; 105-670-059-365-224; 106-011-783-545-979; 106-184-521-213-152; 109-440-424-327-317; 118-670-885-675-090; 135-116-340-737-691; 141-005-140-982-524; 162-119-967-627-958; 164-502-760-111-254; 194-566-776-043-947","41","ERIK W.

IN A STUDY CONDUCTED IN IOWA (USA), FOUR TREATMENTS WITH STRIPS OF NPV VARYING IN SLOPE POSITION AND PROPORTION OF AREA WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED AMONG 12 SMALL AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS IN A BALANCED INCOMPLETE BLOCK DESIGN. RUNOFF SAMPLES FROM 2008 TO 2010 WERE ANALYZED FOR DOC AND CORRELATED WITH FLOW DATA TO DETERMINE FLOW WEIGHTED DOC CONCENTRATIONS AND LOADS. DATA WERE ANALYZED FOR THE ENTIRE 3 YEARS, ANNUALLY, SEASONALLY, MONTHLY, BY FLOW EVENT SIZE AND FOR ONE EXTREME STORM EVENT. OVERALL WE FOUND FEW DIFFERENCES IN DOC CONCENTRATION WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT CONCENTRATIONS WERE GREATER IN THE 10 % NPV AT THE FOOTSLOPE WATERSHEDS THAN THE 20 % NPV IN CONTOURS WATERSHEDS OVER THE 3 YEARS, AND THE 100 % AGRICULTURAL TREATMENT HAD HIGHER DOC CONCENTRATIONS THAN ALL NPV TREATMENTS DURING THE ONE EXTREME EVENT. BECAUSE THE NPV TREATMENTS REDUCED RUNOFF, DOC EXPORT TENDED TO BE HIGHEST IN THE 100 % AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS OVER THE 3 YEARS AND DURING HIGH FLOWS. WE ALSO COMPARED TWO WATERSHEDS THAT WERE RESTORED TO 100 % NPV AND FOUND DECREASES IN DOC CONCENTRATIONS AND LOADS INDICATING THAT COMPLETE CONVERSION TO PRAIRIE LEADS TO LESS WATERSHED DOC EXPORT. REGRESSION RESULTS ALSO SUPPORT THE CONTENTION THAT INCREASES IN THE PERCENTAGE OF NPV IN THE WATERSHED DECREASES WATERSHED EXPORT OF DOC. FURTHER ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT DOC CONCENTRATIONS WERE DILUTED AS FLOW EVENT SIZE INCREASED, INDEPENDENT OF ANY TREATMENT EFFECTS.

RAPE PESTS WHICH ARE KNOWN TO POPULATE THE FIELDS FROM THE EDGES MIGHT BE AUGMENTED BY SOWN WEED STRIPS. TO EVALUATE WHETHER WEED STRIPS HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON RAPE CROP, INSECT PESTS AND THEIR ANTAGONISTS WERE STUDIED IN A WINTER RAPE FIELD NEAR BERNE, SWITZERLAND, DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS BY A SOWN WEED STRIP. THEY WERE REGISTERED AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES FROM THE WEED STRIP AND FROM THE OPPOSITE FIELD BOUNDARY IN 1993. THE POLLEN BEETLE MELIGETHES SP. AND THE CABBAGE WEEVILS CEUTORHYNCHUS ASSIMILIS PAYK., C. NAPI GYLL. AND C. PALLIDACTYLUS MARSH AND THE BRASSICA POD MIDGE DASINEURA BRASSICAE WINN. WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FREQUENT NEAR THE FIELD BOUNDARY THAN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD AND CLOSE TO THE SOWN WEED STRIP. THIS COULD BE BECAUSE A SOWN WEED STRIP DOES NOT ACT AS A REAL FIELD EDGE. FOR THE INVESTIGATED RAPE PODS, LITTLE DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED AS TO THE RATE OF INFESTATION OF C. ASSIMILIS. IT WAS ASTONISHING THAT ONLY A FEW PREDATORS WERE CAUGHT BY SWEEP NETTING IN THE WHOLE FIELD AS WELL AS CLOSE TO THE WEED STRIP. A HIGHER NUMBER OF PARASITOIDS NEAR THE SOWN WEED STRIP COULD NOT BE FOUND EITHER, WHICH WAS PROBABLY DUE TO THEIR HIGH MOBILITY.

WE TESTED THE HYPOTHESES THAT FIELD MARGINS OFFER A HIGHER DIVERSITY OF INVERTEBRATE PREY THAN INTENSIVELY MANAGED CROPS, AND THAT THE DIET OF NESTLINGS RECEIVING FOOD FROM FIELD MARGINS WILL THEREFORE BE MORE DIVERSE THAN THAT OF OTHER NESTLINGS. FIELD MARGINS HAD A GREATER VARIETY OF INVERTEBRATE PREY GROUPS TO OFFER THAN THE INTENSIVELY MANAGED CROPS. COLEOPTERA WERE THE MOST FREQUENTLY AND MOST ABUNDANTLY EATEN PREY GROUP BY BOTH ADULTS AND NESTLINGS. TOGETHER, COLEOPTERA, DIPTERA, LEPIDOPTERA, HYMENOPTERA AND ARANEAE ACCOUNTED FOR 91% OF THE NESTLING DIET. NESTLINGS ATE LARGER PREY ITEMS AND A LARGER PROPORTION OF LARVAE THAN ADULTS. ALMOST 75% OF BOTH ADULTS AND NESTLINGS CONSUMED PLANT MATERIAL, PERHAPS INDICATING A SCARCITY OF INVERTEBRATE RESOURCES. WHEN PROVIDED WITH FOOD FROM FIELD MARGINS, THE MEAN NUMBER OF INVERTEBRATE ORDERS IN THE NESTLING DIET INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 4.7 TO 5.5 AND THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES FROM 4.2 TO 5.8 PER SAMPLE.

RIPARIAN BUFFERS ARE OFTEN USED TO REDUCE AGRICULTURAL NPS YET THE EFFECT OF BUFFERS IN THE WATERSHED IS DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY. USING CORRECTED AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION (AICC) AND MODEL AVERAGING, WE COMPARED FLOW-PATH RIPARIAN BUFFER MODELS WITH LAND USE/LAND COVER (LULC) MODELS IN 24 WATERSHEDS FROM THE SE COASTAL PLAIN TO DETERMINE THE ABILITY OF RIPARIAN BUFFERS TO REDUCE OR MITIGATE STREAM TOTAL NITROGEN CONCENTRATIONS (TNC). ADDITIONAL MODELS CONSIDERED THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF HEADWATERS AND ARTIFICIAL AGRICULTURAL DRAINAGE IN THE COASTAL PLAIN. A BUFFER MODEL WHICH INCLUDED CROPLAND AND NON-BUFFERED CROPLAND BEST EXPLAINED STREAM TNC (R2 = 0.75) AND WAS FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE THE CORRECT MODEL THAN THE LULC MODEL. THE MODEL AVERAGE PREDICTED THAT CURRENT BUFFERS REMOVED 52 % OF NITROGEN FROM THE EDGE-OF-FIELD AND 45 % OF POTENTIAL NITROGEN FROM THE AVERAGE SE COASTAL PLAIN WATERSHED. ON AVERAGE, 26 % OF STREAM NITROGEN LEAKED THROUGH BUFFERED CROPLAND. OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT STREAM TNC COULD POTENTIALLY BE REDUCED BY 34 % IF BUFFERS WERE ADEQUATELY RESTORED ON ALL CROPLAND. SUCH ESTIMATES PROVIDE REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS OF NITROGEN REMOVAL VIA BUFFERS TO WATERSHED MANAGERS AS THEY ATTEMPT TO MEET WATER QUALITY GOALS. IN ADDITION, MODEL COMPARISONS OF AICC VALUES INDICATED THAT NON-HEADWATER BUFFERS MAY CONTRIBUTE LITTLE TO STREAM TNC.

WHILE LANDSCAPE CONTEXT AND HABITAT QUALITY ARE KNOWN TO INFLUENCE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF BEES, THERE IS A LACK OF EVIDENCE FROM MANIPULATIVE FIELD EXPERIMENTS ON BEES' RESPONSES TO ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT ACROSS DIFFERENTLY STRUCTURED LANDSCAPES. WE PRESENT THE RESULTS OF A LARGE-SCALE STUDY THAT INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF A TARGETED AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEME (AES) ON BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS SPP.) OVER THREE YEARS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. FORAGE PATCHES OF DIFFERENT SIZES WERE SOWN WITH A CONSERVATION FLOWER MIXTURE ACROSS EIGHT SITES COVERING A BROAD RANGE OF AGRICULTURAL LAND USE TYPES. SPECIES RICHNESS AND WORKER DENSITIES (ESPECIALLY OF THE LONGER-TONGUED BOMBUS SPECIES FOR WHICH THE MIXTURE WAS TARGETED) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ON SOWN FORAGE PATCHES THAN ON EXISTING NON-CROP CONTROL HABITATS THROUGHOUT THE THREE-YEAR STUDY, BUT THE STRENGTH OF THIS RESPONSE DEPENDED ON BOTH THE PROPORTIONS OF ARABLE LAND AND ABUNDANCE OF HERBACEOUS FORB SPECIES IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE. THE SIZE OF SOWN PATCHES ALSO AFFECTED WORKER DENSITY, WITH SMALLER PATCHES (0.25 HA) ATTRACTING HIGHER DENSITIES OF SOME SPECIES THAN LARGER PATCHES (1.0 HA). OUR MODELS SHOW THAT A TARGETED AES CAN DELIVER GREATER NET BENEFITS IN MORE INTENSIVELY FARMED AREAS, IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF BUMBLE BEES SUPPORTED, THAN IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES WHERE OTHER FORAGING HABITATS EXIST. THESE FINDINGS SERVE TO STRENGTHEN THE EVIDENCE BASE FOR EXTENDING AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES TO BOOST DECLINING POLLINATOR POPULATIONS TO A LARGER NUMBER OF AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES ACROSS THE GLOBE.","21","5","1760","1771","POLLINATOR; FORAGE (HONEY BEE); FORB; FORAGING; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; CONTEXT (LANGUAGE USE); SPECIES RICHNESS; AGROFORESTRY; ABUNDANCE (ECOLOGY); BIOLOGY","","AGRICULTURE; ANIMALS; BEES/CLASSIFICATION; BEHAVIOR, ANIMAL/PHYSIOLOGY; CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES/METHODS; ECOSYSTEM; ENGLAND; FLOWERS","","BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL (BBS/E/C/00004970) UNITED KINGDOM","https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/10-0677.1 https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/34532 https://core.ac.uk/display/2779919 https://repository.rothamsted.ac.uk/item/8q936/bumble-bee-species-responses-to-a-targeted-conservation-measure-depend-on-landscape-context-and-habitat-quality http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/10-0677.1/abstract https://www.jstor.org/stable/23023115 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/10-0677.1 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21830716 https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/34532/1/Carvell_etal_2011_EcolAppl.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/2779919.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1890/10-0677.1","21830716","10.1890/10-0677.1","2138326488","","0","003-460-280-575-85X; 008-225-619-668-580; 010-290-657-368-370; 011-968-803-898-621; 012-267-243-122-028; 013-185-681-358-943; 014-590-282-698-428; 015-905-951-111-509; 016-989-884-391-279; 018-631-611-493-436; 020-453-657-118-968; 021-657-818-388-442; 021-763-881-730-115; 022-392-117-877-556; 023-208-215-719-846; 024-093-678-975-458; 024-940-486-253-797; 028-043-899-910-64X; 031-862-039-493-29X; 034-333-107-858-752; 034-980-495-883-757; 035-138-891-064-544; 037-733-558-467-103; 046-004-550-166-441; 048-543-721-099-075; 049-091-169-377-597; 050-170-086-535-191; 052-425-505-697-799; 052-621-223-170-401; 056-099-523-856-735; 069-083-458-833-742; 074-793-529-288-006; 075-065-572-952-073; 078-419-232-375-219; 083-810-224-480-214; 085-507-496-811-84X; 098-312-271-690-700; 104-896-273-096-868; 111-381-468-642-188; 112-917-317-852-89X; 115-606-139-771-296; 117-947-244-584-95X; 120-524-273-028-868; 150-275-342-089-773; 161-644-427-039-572; 168-312-770-361-773; 178-850-274-409-230","108","CLAIRE CARVELL; JULIET L.

THIS PATTERN IS ALSO A COMPONENT OF FARM MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT. THIS PAPER DEALS WITH MODELING THE LAND USE SPATIAL ORGANIZATION IN FARMS ACCORDING TO THESE DUAL CRITERIA. THE HYPOTHESIS IS TESTED THAT THE LOCATION OF FARMS ALONG A GRADIENT OF BOCAGE LANDSCAPE—GRADIENT OF DECREASING HEDGEROWS DENSITY AND INCREASING FIELD SIZE—INFLUENCES THEIR INNER LAND USE ORGANIZATION. THE TESTS WERE BASED ON MUTUAL INFORMATION AND PROVIDED A HIERARCHY OF DRIVING FACTORS OF LAND USE ALLOCATION IN FARMS, AS WELL AS A CLASSIFICATION OF COMBINATIONS OF LAND USE AND FIELD TYPES. THREE BOCAGE SITES—A, DENSE; B, INTERMEDIATE; AND C, OPEN BOCAGE—WERE CHOSEN IN NORTHEAST BRITTANY (FRANCE), ON A 20 KM2 MICRO-REGION OF CONVENTIONAL DAIRY PRODUCTION BASED ON MAIZE (ZEA MAYS L.), GRASSLAND AND WINTER CEREALS, MAINLY WHEAT (TRITICUM SPP.). IN THIS CONTEXT, LAND USE ALLOCATION IN A FARM WAS BETTER EXPLAINED BY THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FARM TERRITORY, I.E. THE ACTUAL LAND USED BY A SINGLE FARM, RATHER THAN BY THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FARM HOUSEHOLD/ENTERPRISE, AS DEFINED BY PRODUCTION, SOCIOECONOMIC AND TECHNICAL FEATURES. FARMS OF THE OPEN BOCAGE SHOWED MARKED CONCENTRIC PATTERNS OF LAND USE AWAY FROM THE FARMSTEADS, INVOLVING PROGRESSIVELY PASTURES USED BY DAIRY COWS, FODDER CROPS, PASTURES USED BY LIVESTOCK AND CASH CROPS. IN THESE FARMS, THERE WAS A PRONOUNCED DIFFERENTIATION OF THE FIELDS THAT HELD SIMULTANEOUSLY CONSTRAINTS OF SURROUNDING HEDGEROWS, SMALL SIZE AND HYDROMORPHY. FARMS OF THE DENSE BOCAGE SITE WERE MORE FRAGMENTED AND CONSTRAINTS WERE DISTRIBUTED MORE DIVERSELY THROUGH FIELDS, SO THAT LAND USE ALLOCATION WAS NOT OPTIMIZED ACCORDING TO THE DISTANCE FROM THE FARMSTEAD. THE CONCENTRIC PATTERN OF LAND USE WAS THEREFORE DISTORTED IN THESE FARMS. AT A LANDSCAPE LEVEL, SUCH DISTORTIONS LED TO A LAND USE MOSAIC DOMINATED BY LARGE PATCHES OF SPECIALIZED FIELDS IN THE OPEN BOCAGE, AND TO A FINE GRAIN AND HETEROGENEOUS LAND USE MOSAIC IN THE DENSE BOCAGE. THIS STUDY THEREFORE DEMONSTRATED HOW THE STRUCTURE OF THE FARM TERRITORY IN DIFFERENT BOCAGE LANDSCAPES HAS A MAJOR INFLUENCE ON LAND USE ALLOCATION IN FARMS. THE RESULTS EMPHASIZE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN LAND USE AND LAND STRUCTURING IN FARM QUALITY OF MANAGEMENT, WHICH IN TURN INFLUENCES THE LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE.","101","1","53","72","LIVESTOCK; AGRICULTURE; CASH CROP; COMMON SPATIAL PATTERN; GEOGRAPHY; GRASSLAND; CONTEXT (LANGUAGE USE); DRIVING FACTORS; LAND USE; AGROFORESTRY","","","","","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880903001993 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880903001993","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/S0167-8809(03)00199-3","","10.1016/s0167-8809(03)00199-3","2041181481","","0","000-484-826-607-866; 000-689-156-232-020; 002-607-184-736-112; 003-546-476-189-819; 005-984-268-611-870; 009-519-509-199-293; 010-687-152-524-484; 011-763-120-498-742; 023-950-701-194-236; 026-537-035-659-141; 030-957-113-466-229; 035-527-491-535-676; 037-957-821-245-261; 039-800-551-937-475; 040-398-047-933-072; 041-788-996-695-512; 047-169-122-814-90X; 051-434-907-184-089; 053-137-818-248-134; 067-358-106-573-016; 068-110-607-470-581; 073-021-255-359-439; 073-394-076-706-054; 073-991-527-323-833; 074-988-388-452-369; 081-015-842-500-088; 084-776-462-976-223; 089-257-427-127-83X; 089-585-128-318-217; 091-362-025-881-051; 091-758-692-195-881; 092-983-060-262-609; 093-661-771-475-269; 101-931-589-244-355; 106-864-238-578-702; 108-532-360-722-802; 113-221-284-601-672; 115-818-187-214-915; 130-698-554-759-854; 130-822-660-683-860; 133-716-442-972-509; 134-910-223-418-626; 144-311-251-829-72X; 157-792-538-740-695; 176-506-367-701-104; 198-944-659-141-32X","83","CLAUDINE THENAIL; JACQUES BAUDRY","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","","LENS",0,"THENAIL C, 2004, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","THENAIL C, 2004, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT"

HABITAT DESTRUCTION AND INCREASING LAND USE INTENSITY RESULT IN HABITAT LOSS, FRAGMENTATION AND DEGRADATION, AND SUBSEQUENTLY IN THE LOSS OF SPECIES DIVERSITY. THE FACT THAT THESE FACTORS ARE OFTEN HIGHLY CONFOUNDED MAKES DISENTANGLING THEIR EFFECTS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, AND THEIR RELATIVE IMPACT ON SPECIES LOSS IS MOSTLY SPECULATIVE. 2. IN A TWO-YEAR STUDY, WE ANALYSED THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF CHANGED LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION (INCREASED AREAS OF CROPPED HABITATS), REDUCED HABITAT CONNECTIVITY AND REDUCED HABITAT QUALITY ON NEST COLONIZATION OF CAVITY-NESTING BEES, WASPS AND THEIR PARASITOIDS. WE SELECTED 23 PAIRS OF CONVENTIONAL AND ORGANIC WHEAT FIELDS IN THE CENTRE OF LANDSCAPE CIRCLES (500 M RADIUS) DIFFERING IN EDGE DENSITIES (LANDSCAPE CONFIGURATION) AND % NON-CROP HABITATS (LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION). STANDARDIZED TRAP NESTS WERE ESTABLISHED IN THE FIELD CENTRES AND IN NEIGHBOURING PERMANENT FALLOW STRIPS (MAKING A TOTAL OF 92 NESTING SITES). 3. FACTORS AT ALL THREE SCALES AFFECTED NEST COLONIZATION. WHILE BEES WERE ENHANCED BY HIGH PROPORTIONS OF NON-CROP HABITAT IN THE LANDSCAPE, WASPS PROFITED FROM HIGH EDGE DENSITIES, SUPPORTING OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT WASPS ARE ENHANCED BY CONNECTING CORRIDORS. COLONIZATION OF HERBIVORE-PREDATING WASPS WAS LOWER IN FIELD CENTRES THAN IN FALLOW STRIPS FOR CONVENTIONAL SITES, BUT NOT FOR ORGANIC SITES, INDICATING A FALLOW-LIKE CONNECTIVITY VALUE OF ORGANIC FIELDS. THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF HABITAT TYPE AND FARMING SYSTEM VARIED AMONG FUNCTIONAL GROUPS SUGGESTING THAT THEIR PERCEPTION OF CROP-NON-CROP BOUNDARIES OR THE AVAILABILITY OF THEIR FOOD RESOURCES DIFFERED. 4. LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE EFFECTS ON PARASITOIDS WERE MAINLY MEDIATED BY THEIR HOSTS. PARASITISM RATES WERE MARGINALLY AFFECTED BY LOCAL FACTORS. A SPECIALIST PARASITOID WAS MORE SENSITIVE TO HIGH LAND USE INTENSITY THAN ITS HOST, WHEREAS GENERALIST PARASITOIDS WERE LESS SENSITIVE. 5. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE CONVERSION OF CROPLAND INTO NON-CROP HABITAT MAY NOT BE A SUFFICIENTLY SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY TO ENHANCE WASPS OR OTHER SPECIES THAT SUFFER MORE FROM ISOLATION THAN FROM HABITAT LOSS. INTERESTINGLY, HABITAT CONNECTIVITY APPEARED TO BE ENHANCED BY BOTH HIGHER EDGE DENSITIES AND BY ORGANIC FIELD MANAGEMENT. THUS, WE CONCLUDE THAT HIGH PROPORTIONS OF CONVENTIONALLY MANAGED AND LARGE CROP FIELDS THREATEN POLLINATION AND BIOLOGICAL CONTROL SERVICES AT A LANDSCAPE SCALE.","79","2","491","500","POLLINATOR; BIODIVERSITY; POLLINATION; NEST; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; PARASITOID; GENERALIST AND SPECIALIST SPECIES; HABITAT DESTRUCTION; BIOLOGY","","AGRICULTURE; ANIMALS; BEES/PARASITOLOGY; BIODIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM; WASPS/PARASITOLOGY","","","https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01642.x https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20015213/ https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103077582 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20015213 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01642.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01642.x/full https://eref.uni-bayreuth.de/id/eprint/16289 https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01642.x https://europepmc.org/article/MED/20015213","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1365-2656.2009.01642.X","20015213","10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01642.x","2019296384","","0","001-051-404-142-811; 004-916-984-876-81X; 007-590-189-380-964; 008-225-619-668-580; 008-291-203-169-732; 015-311-657-471-492; 015-348-182-108-487; 017-516-181-294-137; 018-209-687-890-039; 023-935-502-746-047; 024-240-876-657-562; 026-735-761-517-671; 027-867-910-497-397; 030-989-751-486-255; 031-189-865-030-804; 031-862-039-493-29X; 032-452-486-736-649; 035-775-229-294-961; 043-334-181-578-717; 044-315-002-495-725; 045-445-063-674-649; 050-137-130-449-043; 054-274-474-416-858; 056-064-713-708-207; 056-789-845-462-569; 056-892-630-404-500; 057-420-111-160-322; 057-720-330-037-206; 060-093-061-735-556; 062-218-780-389-812; 062-501-527-775-318; 072-547-204-496-863; 075-666-685-673-883; 083-674-424-765-819; 086-268-358-012-610; 086-525-130-009-786; 089-762-789-750-124; 093-579-516-936-299; 094-542-264-880-862; 098-312-271-690-700; 113-194-919-014-308; 115-606-139-771-296; 117-345-687-903-78X; 119-131-541-250-789; 136-469-390-650-498; 142-024-470-292-163; 145-176-906-866-327; 146-382-118-408-345; 153-465-066-221-921; 154-386-144-197-99X; 176-438-790-085-693; 185-374-982-166-638","210","ANDREA HOLZSCHUH; INGOLF STEFFAN-DEWENTER; TEJA TSCHARNTKE","THE JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY","THE JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY","","LENS",0,"HOLZSCHUH A, 2009, THE JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY","HOLZSCHUH A, 2009, THE JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY"

THE LEGISLATION MANDATES 10-M AND 20-M BUFFERS, RESPECTIVELY, FOR MODERATE SLOPED (I.E. 5%) AGRICULTURAL FIELDS THAT BORDER STREAMS. SINCE 2001, ENVIRONMENT CANADA HAS BEEN EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF VARIOUS BUFFER WIDTHS ON OPERATIONAL FARMS IN REDUCING TOXICITY AND CONTAMINANT CONCENTRATIONS IN RUNOFF. SAMPLE COLLECTORS, PLACED IN 44 FIELDS AT THE FIELD EDGE (0M), 10M AND AT DISTANCES OUT TO 30M, COLLECTED OVERLAND FLOW FOLLOWING RAINFALL-INDUCED RUNOFF EVENTS. SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED WITHIN 24 HOURS OF AN EVENT AND ANALYSED FOR SEVEN PESTICIDES (ENDOSULFAN, CHLOROTHALONIL, CARBOFURAN, LINURON, METRIBUZIN, METALAXYL, MANCOZEB), WATER QUALITY PARAMETERS AND DAPHNIA MAGNA TOXICITY. THE 10-M BUFFER REQUIRED FOR MODERATE SLOPED FIELDS WAS EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING CONTAMINANT CONCENTRATIONS BUT NOT ALWAYS TO LESS THAN LETHAL CONCENTRATIONS TO DAPHNIA MAGNA. LIMITED DATA BEYOND 10M FOR FIELDS OF BOTH SLOPE TYPES PRECLUDED MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS ON A SUITABLE BUFFER WIDTH FOR SHALLOW SLOPED FIELDS AND EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF 20-M BUFFERS FOR STEEP SLOPED FIELDS. WHEN PAIRED DATA WERE COMBINED AND STATISTICALLY TESTED FOR ALL FIELDS, THE STUDIED PESTICIDES UNDERWENT A 52-98% AND 68-100% REDUCTION IN AQUEOUS AND PARTICULATE CONCENTRATIONS WITHIN 10M AND 30M, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, BY 10M, SOLUBLE PHOSPHORUS, NITRATE-NITROGEN AND TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLIDS WERE REDUCED BY 34%, 38% AND 64%, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS SUGGEST BUFFER ZONES ON OPERATIONAL FARMS ARE CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING CONTAMINANT REDUCTIONS COMPARABLE TO THOSE REPORTED FOR CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTS. INCONSISTENT SITING OF SAMPLE COLLECTORS BEYOND 10M LIMITED THE EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTS OF FIELD SLOPE AND BUFFER WIDTH ON BUFFER EFFECTIVENESS ON WORKING FARMS. FUTURE STUDIES ON BUFFER EFFICIENCY ON OPERATIONAL FARMS SHOULD FOCUS ON BUILDING THE DATA SET BEYOND 10M AND EVALUATING LOAD REDUCTIONS.","409","5","868","882","PESTICIDE; CHLOROTHALONIL; BUFFER ZONE; WATER QUALITY; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; STREAMS; TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLIDS; SURFACE RUNOFF; ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING; ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING","","AGRICULTURE/LEGISLATION & JURISPRUDENCE; ANIMALS; DAPHNIA/DRUG EFFECTS; ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING; PESTICIDES/ANALYSIS; PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND; RAIN; RIVERS/CHEMISTRY; WATER POLLUTANTS, CHEMICAL/ANALYSIS; WATER POLLUTION/LEGISLATION & JURISPRUDENCE","PESTICIDES; WATER POLLUTANTS, CHEMICAL","","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21163513/ http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969710012428 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969710012428 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21163513 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ScTEn.409..868D/abstract","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.SCITOTENV.2010.11.011","21163513","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.11.011","1988199854","","0","002-650-706-842-54X; 005-046-617-641-306; 009-742-460-635-737; 013-452-798-688-19X; 015-274-013-722-997; 020-537-450-372-975; 024-618-280-817-643; 024-998-467-249-663; 025-131-472-929-81X; 029-496-825-325-876; 040-806-887-128-56X; 042-036-288-239-561; 042-230-387-909-769; 044-401-317-828-273; 046-747-744-517-198; 052-894-240-545-387; 064-662-281-730-944; 066-508-752-240-077; 070-129-859-863-682; 076-826-572-086-275; 078-927-735-353-813; 079-562-504-772-874; 082-797-391-654-568; 083-528-691-484-522; 102-929-358-865-836; 103-148-967-328-600; 103-286-115-762-912; 111-288-588-656-115; 117-074-543-175-080; 169-607-559-923-667; 181-090-792-931-175; 191-147-319-900-194; 194-158-767-830-671","56","A.M.

IN THIS STUDY, A SIMPLE AND RAPID METHODOLOGY WAS EMPLOYED TO MEASURE THE QUALITY OF DIFFERENT HABITATS FOR BUTTERFLY SPECIES ON 10 ARABLE FARMS IN LOWLAND BRITAIN. THIS HABITAT MONITORING WAS SEVEN TIMES MORE RAPID THAN THE TRADITIONAL SPECIES-BASED BUTTERFLY MONITORING. DATA ON BUTTERFLY ABUNDANCE WERE COMBINED WITH THE INFORMATION GATHERED ON HABITAT QUALITY AT FIVE OF THE FARMS USING STEPWISE REGRESSION. THESE MODELS HAD A CONSISTENTLY HIGH DEGREE OF EXPLANATORY POWER FOR THE SUMMARY VARIABLES OF TOTAL BUTTERFLY ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS, AND THE FUNCTIONAL GROUPINGS OF MOBILE AND IMMOBILE SPECIES. THERE WAS GOOD AGREEMENT BETWEEN OBSERVED AND PREDICTED ESTIMATES OF SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE WHEN THE MODELS WERE VALIDATED ON A FURTHER FIVE INDEPENDENT SITES. MODELS TO PREDICT THE ABUNDANCE OF 11 COMMON BUTTERFLY SPECIES WERE ALSO PRODUCED. THESE VARIED CONSIDERABLY IN THEIR PREDICTIVE POWER AND VALIDITY BETWEEN SPECIES. THE RESULTS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF TARGETED HABITAT CREATION FOR BUTTERFLIES WHICH IS PROMOTED UNDER THE AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES, ESPECIALLY THE RECENTLY INTRODUCED POLLEN AND NECTAR SEED MIXTURES (WM2) AVAILABLE UNDER THE COUNTRYSIDE STEWARDSHIP SCHEME. THE MODELS CONFIRMED THE IMPORTANCE OF SHELTER, FLORISTICALLY DIVERSE FIELD MARGINS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF NECTAR RESOURCES FROM LEGUME SPECIES IN EXPLAINING THE ABUNDANCE OF IMMOBILE BUTTERFLY SPECIES IN ARABLE LANDSCAPES. THESE SOURCES OF NECTAR AND THE PRESENCE OF LARVAL HOST PLANTS IN THE CRUCIFER FAMILY WERE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN EXPLAINING THE ABUNDANCE OF MOBILE SPECIES. THE RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF THE POTENTIAL OF THIS APPROACH FOR: (I) ASSESSING HABITAT QUALITY FOR BUTTERFLIES IN INTENSIVELY MANAGED LANDSCAPES; (II) ENHANCING THE VALUE OF BUTTERFLY MONITORING SCHEMES IN EXPLAINING CHANGES IN BUTTERFLY ABUNDANCE AT THE SITE AND NATIONAL SCALE; AND (III) INFORMING HABITAT MANAGEMENT AND RESTORATION GUIDELINES FOR BUTTERFLY CONSERVATION ON ARABLE FARMLAND.","118","3","313","325","BIODIVERSITY; NECTAR; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; BUTTERFLY; SPECIES RICHNESS; AGROECOSYSTEM; ARABLE LAND; ABUNDANCE (ECOLOGY); BIOLOGY","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320703003690 https://core.ac.uk/display/381230","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.BIOCON.2003.09.011","","10.1016/j.biocon.2003.09.011","2090811884","","0","008-167-536-662-383; 009-012-164-159-153; 010-388-027-175-334; 015-031-975-300-430; 022-821-709-291-930; 032-493-338-723-126; 033-171-578-206-480; 033-248-413-039-314; 040-213-683-952-22X; 044-445-829-636-966; 047-547-531-740-994; 048-443-302-315-740; 051-060-286-692-596; 056-383-727-358-744; 056-585-869-238-25X; 063-024-434-156-048; 071-000-612-789-205; 073-010-346-426-592; 077-623-747-437-53X; 079-068-774-342-74X; 080-164-660-083-693; 082-389-624-773-160; 086-062-368-206-503; 096-611-124-444-400; 105-145-742-902-746; 107-150-898-526-934; 114-480-653-531-829; 117-233-951-265-769; 146-186-564-390-79X; 170-590-252-813-233; 171-352-683-438-394; 171-738-087-214-88X; 180-254-269-257-202; 185-008-568-344-443","125","RICHARD F.

THESE CHANGES HAVE AFFECTED THE POPULATIONS OF MANY SPECIES OF BIRDS IN THE ESPINAL ECOREGION OF ARGENTINA. HOWEVER, RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BIRDS AND AGRICULTURE IN THE NEOTROPICS ARE POORLY KNOWN. WE ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF CROPS AND FIELD MARGINS IN AN AREA OF AGRICULTURE TYPICAL FOR THE ESPINAL ECOREGION ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE BIRD COMMUNITY, AND WE ASSESSED THE VALUE OF THIS HABITAT FOR SPECIES OF CONSERVATION CONCERN. BIRDS AND VEGETATION WERE SAMPLED IN AND ALONG THE MARGINS OF FIELDS OF SOYBEAN (THE MOST WIDESPREAD CROP) AND ALFALFA. TWENTY-FIVE OF THE 41 SPECIES RECORDED—INCLUDING ALL THE SPECIES OF CONSERVATION CONCERN—WERE FOUND ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN FIELD MARGINS; ONLY FIVE SPECIES OCCURRED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN WITHIN THE FIELDS.

SURFACE RUN-OFF CAUSED BY NATURAL RAINFALL AND RELATED TRANSPORT OF METOLACHLOR, TERBUTHYLAZINE AND PENDIMETHALIN WERE MEASURED ON PLOTS OF 40 M LENGTH WITHOUT FILTER STRIPS (F0), AND AFTER PASSING OVER THREE TYPES OF HERBICIDE-UNTREATED FIELD MARGIN: 12 M CONSERVATION HEADLAND (CH12), 6 M (GF6) AND 12 M GRASS STRIPS (GF12). RUN-OFF WAS ALSO MEASURED AFTER SIMULATED RAINFALL ON 7 M LONG PLOTS WITHOUT (F0) AND WITH 3 M GRASS STRIPS (GF3). ALL THREE HERBICIDES WERE TRANSPORTED BOTH IN DISSOLVED AND IN ADSORBED FORMS; THE PARTITIONING DEPENDED ON THEIR WATER SOLUBILITY WITH METOLACHLOR AND TERBUTHYLAZINE MAINLY TRANSLOCATED IN DISSOLVED FORM (F0: HIGHEST MEAN CONCENTRATIONS FOR A NATURAL RUN-OFF EVENT 721 AND 220 ΜG L -1 , RESPECTIVELY). PENDIMETHALIN WAS PREDOMINANTLY TRANSPORTED IN ADSORBED FORM (MAXIMUM MEAN CONCENTRATION 11.2 ΜG L -1 ). IN THE SEDIMENT, THE HIGHEST MEAN HERBICIDE CONTENTS IN A SINGLE NATURAL EVENT (F0) ACCOUNTED FOR 2294 ΜG KG -1 (METOLACHLOR), 1317 ΜG KG -1 (TERBUTHYLAZINE) AND 5648 ΜG KG -1 (PENDIMETHALIN). THE PROPORTIONS OF APPLIED HERBICIDE TRANSLOCATED WERE 0.3% (METOLACHLOR), 0.2% (TERBUTHYLAZINE) AND 0.06% (PENDIMETHALIN; F0, NATURAL RAINFALL). THE EXTENT OF HERBICIDE TRANSPORT DECREASED WITH TIME BUT WITHIN THIS TREND SOIL SEALING, SOIL MOISTURE AND AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF RAINFALL INCREASED LOSSES. COMPARED WITH THE F0 PLOTS, THE REDUCTION OF HERBICIDE TRANSLOCATION AFTER NATURAL RAINFALL REACHED 80-83% (CH12), 80-88% (GF6) AND >99% (GF12) OVER THE 3-YEAR PERIOD. THE 12 M GRASS STRIPS ALLOWED ONLY ONE EXTREME RUN-OFF EVENT TO PASS THROUGH, THUS PROVIDING A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE WATERCOURSE PROTECTION AGAINST HERBICIDE POLLUTION.","23","3","294","305","PESTICIDE; WATER CONTENT; TERBUTHYLAZINE; PENDIMETHALIN; METOLACHLOR; SEDIMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SURFACE RUNOFF; AGRONOMY; SURFACE WATER","","","","","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1475-2743.2007.00097.x https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-2743.2007.00097.x","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1475-2743.2007.00097.X","","10.1111/j.1475-2743.2007.00097.x","2088845239","","0","000-526-408-411-556; 001-424-754-077-983; 003-148-094-786-550; 003-888-081-454-171; 006-232-969-732-127; 027-521-568-087-326; 049-773-598-549-535; 051-851-638-777-86X; 069-097-776-076-932; 094-049-137-663-313; 096-878-710-039-072; 102-299-231-485-20X; 111-288-588-656-115; 117-074-543-175-080; 131-944-587-954-848; 149-367-063-545-839; 176-181-840-447-605; 181-000-667-326-695","48","STEFAN PÄTZOLD; C.

COMPARED TO HERBACEOUS VEGETATION, HIGH TRANSPIRATION RATES ARE MEASURED FOR ISOLATED TREES, SHELTERBELTS OR HEDGEROWS. THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE INFLUENCE OF A TREE HEDGE ON THE SOIL AND GROUNDWATER CL− CONCENTRATIONS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF USING CL− AS AN INDICATOR OF TRANSPIRATION AND WATER MOVEMENTS NEAR THE TREE ROWS. CL− CONCENTRATIONS WERE MEASURED OVER 1 YEAR AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS IN THE UNSATURATED ZONE AND IN THE GROUNDWATER ALONG A TRANSECT INTERSECTING A BOTTOMLAND OAK HEDGE. WE OBSERVED A STRONG SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY OF CL− CONCENTRATIONS, WITH VERY HIGH VALUES UP TO 2 G L−1 IN THE UNSATURATED ZONE AND 1·2 G L−1 IN THE UPPER PART OF THE GROUNDWATER. THIS CONTRASTS WITH THE LOW AND HOMOGENEOUS CONCENTRATIONS (60–70 MG L−1) IN THE DEEPER PART OF THE GROUNDWATER. CL− ACCUMULATION IN THE UNSATURATED ZONE AT THE END OF THE VEGETATION SEASON ALLOWS US TO IDENTIFY THE ACTIVE ROOT ZONE EXTENSION OF TREES. IN WINTER, UPSLOPE OF THE TREE ROW, DOWNWARDS LEACHING PARTLY RENEWS THE SOIL SOLUTION IN THE ROOT ZONE, WHILE THE SLOW WATER MOVEMENT UNDER THE TREES OR FARTHER DOWNSLOPE RESULTS IN CL− ACCUMULATION AND LEADS TO A SALINIZATION OF THE SOIL AND GROUNDWATER. THIS SALINIZATION IS OF THE SAME ORDER AS EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS PRODUCE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON OAK SEEDLINGS. THE MEASUREMENT OF CL− CONCENTRATIONS IN THE UNSATURATED ZONE UNDER TREE ROWS AT THE END OF THE VEGETATION SEASON WOULD INDICATE WHETHER CERTAIN TOPOGRAPHIC, PEDOLOGICAL OR CLIMATIC CONDITIONS ARE LIKELY TO FAVOUR A STRONG SALINIZATION OF THE SOIL, AS OBSERVED IN THE PRESENT STUDY.

THE VFS REDUCED BOTH RUNOFF DEPTH (10.2–91.2%) AND HERBICIDE LOSSES (85.7–97.9%) IN THE MONITORED RAINFALL EVENTS. TOTAL HERBICIDE LOSS WITH RUNOFF WAS LOW (0.69–3.98 G HA−1 WITHOUT VFS, LESS THAN 0.27 G HA−1 WITH VFS), BUT CONCENTRATIONS WERE SOMETIMES VERY HIGH, ESPECIALLY OF TERBUTHYLAZINE AND ISOPROTURON DURING THE FIRST EVENTS AFTER TREATMENT. IN THESE EVENTS THERE WAS A HIGH PROBABILITY OF EXCEEDING THE ECOTOXICOLOGICAL ENDPOINT FOR ALGAE, BUT THE VFS HELPED TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL RISK. TWO VFS EFFECTIVENESS MECHANISMS WERE IDENTIFIED: (I) DILUTION, AND (II) A “SPONGE-LIKE” EFFECT, WHICH TEMPORARILY TRAPPED CHEMICALS INSIDE THE VFS BEFORE RELEASING THEM.","61","5","717","725","PESTICIDE; TERBUTHYLAZINE; METOLACHLOR; FILTER STRIP; PHYTOTOXICITY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SURFACE RUNOFF; AGRONOMY; ARABLE LAND; ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING; WATER POLLUTION","","ACETAMIDES/ANALYSIS; ANIMALS; ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING; EUKARYOTA; FESTUCA; FISHES; HERBICIDES/ANALYSIS; PHENYLUREA COMPOUNDS/ANALYSIS; RAIN; RISK ASSESSMENT; SOIL POLLUTANTS/ANALYSIS; TRIAZINES/ANALYSIS; VIBURNUM; WATER MOVEMENTS; WATER POLLUTANTS, CHEMICAL/ANALYSIS; WATER POLLUTION/PREVENTION & CONTROL","ACETAMIDES; HERBICIDES; PHENYLUREA COMPOUNDS; SOIL POLLUTANTS; TRIAZINES; WATER POLLUTANTS, CHEMICAL; ISOPROTURON; TERBUTYLAZINE; METOLACHLOR","","https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005Chmsp..61..717V/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16219506 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653505004546 https://core.ac.uk/display/53404823 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653505004546","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.CHEMOSPHERE.2005.03.043","16219506","10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.03.043","2038145559","","0","011-230-574-777-701; 020-537-450-372-975; 024-556-636-186-088; 025-131-472-929-81X; 028-034-500-501-517; 034-195-159-242-383; 041-595-642-229-417; 044-327-313-877-518; 055-486-051-386-205; 065-427-966-967-115; 072-053-332-217-590; 072-742-147-675-34X; 078-927-735-353-813; 079-562-504-772-874; 082-425-030-497-387; 082-797-391-654-568; 083-528-691-484-522; 103-148-967-328-600; 107-861-247-559-610; 115-642-860-718-878; 135-211-483-825-15X; 138-643-821-809-522; 150-226-384-158-289; 178-140-173-536-98X; 197-154-241-626-829","55","M.

THE FEW SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CONSERVATION AND AGRICULTURAL LAND-USES SUGGEST THAT THE RANDOM PLACEMENT OF CONSERVATION LAND-USES IS AN INEFFICIENT WAY TO IMPROVE WATER QUALITY.","20","4","1083","1092","RIPARIAN ZONE; AGRICULTURE; RIPARIAN FOREST; WATER QUALITY; SEDIMENT; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; LAND USE; PHOSPHORUS","","","","","https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1189&context=nrem_pubs http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-fdf1deef-d9ae-4cf7-8159-83076d5507cf https://works.bepress.com/richard_schultz/45/ https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/nrem_pubs/189/","HTTP://YADDA.ICM.EDU.PL/YADDA/ELEMENT/BWMETA1.ELEMENT.AGRO-FDF1DEEF-D9AE-4CF7-8159-83076D5507CF","","","2123230916","","0","000-079-952-662-293; 004-349-107-287-986; 007-868-997-910-082; 014-491-655-050-373; 016-053-060-230-167; 019-744-631-826-397; 033-044-738-035-245; 034-592-985-941-134; 034-919-730-265-105; 038-335-400-539-341; 040-221-131-319-100; 041-814-374-999-489; 044-411-819-751-746; 048-396-942-580-957; 056-448-774-024-709; 056-580-414-502-20X; 057-727-962-585-077; 059-425-649-279-03X; 083-619-701-060-090; 085-809-299-662-172; 090-795-276-892-641; 097-728-085-931-913; 099-909-333-640-927; 102-307-069-255-349; 116-694-649-287-604; 118-507-802-614-015; 123-241-612-304-775; 132-380-946-851-855; 140-616-695-304-053; 143-672-110-669-096; 158-384-086-943-400; 158-726-850-354-116; 190-027-017-517-824","7","GEORGE N.

WHEN MODELING THE HYDROLOGY OF VF, IT IS OFTEN ASSUMED THAT OVERLAND FLOW IS PLANAR, BUT OUR RESEARCH INDICATES THAT IT CAN BE TWO-DIMENSIONAL WITH CONVERGING AND DIVERGING PATHWAYS. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT FLOW CONVERGENCE WILL NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE THE SEDIMENT TRAPPING CAPABILITY OF VF. THE OBJECTIVES WERE TO DEVELOP A TWO-DIMENSIONAL MODELING APPROACH FOR ESTIMATING SEDIMENT TRAPPING IN VF AND TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF CONVERGING OVERLAND FLOW ON SEDIMENT TRAPPING BY VF. IN THIS STUDY, THE PERFORMANCE OF A VF THAT HAS FIELD-SCALE FLOW PATH LENGTHS WITH UNCONTROLLED FLOW DIRECTION WAS QUANTIFIED USING FIELD EXPERIMENTS AND HYDROLOGIC MODELING. SIMULATIONS OF WATER FLOW PROCESSES WERE PERFORMED USING THE PHYSICALLY BASED, DISTRIBUTED MODEL MIKE SHE. A MODELING APPROACH THAT PREDICTS SEDIMENT TRAPPING AND ACCOUNTS FOR CONVERGING AND DIVERGING FLOW WAS DEVELOPED BASED ON THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY SEDIMENT FILTRATION MODEL. THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT AS FLOW CONVERGENCE INCREASES, FILTER PERFORMANCE DECREASES, AND THE IMPACTS ARE GREATER AT HIGHER FLOW RATES AND SHORTER FILTER LENGTHS. CONVERGENCE THAT OCCURS IN THE CONTRIBUTING FIELD (IN-FIELD) UPSTREAM OF THE BUFFER HAD A SLIGHTLY GREATER IMPACT THAN CONVERGENCE THAT OCCURRED IN THE FILTER (IN-FILTER). AN AREA-BASED CONVERGENCE RATIO WAS DEFINED THAT RELATES THE ACTUAL FLOW AREA IN A VF TO THE THEORETICAL FLOW AREA WITHOUT FLOW CONVERGENCE. WHEN THE CONVERGENCE RATIO WAS 0.70, IN-FILTER CONVERGENCE CAUSED THE SEDIMENT TRAPPING EFFICIENCY TO BE REDUCED FROM 80% FOR THE PLANAR FLOW CONDITION TO 64% FOR THE CONVERGING FLOW CONDITION. WHEN AN EQUIVALENT CONVERGENCE OCCURRED IN-FIELD, THE SEDIMENT TRAPPING EFFICIENCY WAS REDUCED TO 57%. THUS, NOT ONLY IS CONVERGENCE IMPORTANT BUT THE LOCATION WHERE CONVERGENCE OCCURS CAN ALSO BE IMPORTANT.","48","2","541","555","HYDROLOGICAL MODELLING; SOIL SCIENCE; VOLUMETRIC FLOW RATE; FILTER (LARGE EDDY SIMULATION); MIKE SHE; SEDIMENT; WATER FLOW; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; DISTRIBUTED ELEMENT MODEL; FLOW (PSYCHOLOGY)","","","","","http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1585&context=abe_eng_pubs http://elibrary.asabe.org/abstract.asp??JID=3&AID=18328 http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/abe_eng_pubs/302/ https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/biosysengfacpub/662/ https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=1201100 https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1665&context=biosysengfacpub https://works.bepress.com/matthew_helmers/68/ https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5491 http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/21371 http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/ja/ja_helmers002.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/38933088 https://www.srs.fs.fed.us/pubs/21371 https://core.ac.uk/download/38933088.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.13031/2013.18328","","10.13031/2013.18328","2093488077","","0","003-148-094-786-550; 004-933-400-226-990; 013-158-601-419-635; 017-168-449-861-203; 021-860-145-353-993; 022-325-890-159-594; 024-799-639-156-913; 027-988-435-399-704; 028-912-913-842-092; 031-444-429-401-694; 045-573-628-287-109; 057-603-249-735-303; 068-432-148-221-069; 076-826-572-086-275; 082-797-391-654-568; 086-812-760-777-597; 097-054-825-053-530; 111-288-588-656-115; 134-191-656-379-548; 182-906-730-748-020","26","MATTHEW J.

ITS MOST COMMON PARASITOID IS COPIDOSOMA ARETAS (WALKER) (HYMENOPTERA: CHALCIDOIDEA: ENCYRTIDAE). TO IDENTIFY SELECTIVE FLOWERING PLANTS THAT COULD BE USED TO INCREASE FUNCTIONAL BIODIVERSITY, THE LONGEVITY OF C. ARETAS AND ITS HOST A. COMARIANA WAS ASSESSED ON 5 FLOWERING SPECIES: BUCKWHEAT, FAGOPYRUM ESCULENTUM MOENCH (CARYOPHYLLALES: POLYGONACEAE); BORAGE, BORAGO OFFICINALIS L. (BORAGINACEAE); STRAWBERRY, FRAGARIA X ANANASSA DUCHESNE (ROSALES: ROSACEAE); PHACELIA, PHACELIA TANACETIFOLIA BENTHAM (BORAGINACEAE); AND DILL, ANETHUM GRAVEOLENS L. (APIALES: APIACEAE). DILL WAS ONLY TESTED WITH C. ARETAS. SUCROSE AND POLLEN SERVED AS POSITIVE CONTROLS, AND PURE WATER AS A NEGATIVE CONTROL. IN A SUBSEQUENT FIELD EXPERIMENT, A. COMARIANA LARVAL DENSITY WAS ASSESSED AT 1, 6, AND 11 M DISTANCES FROM BUCKWHEAT FLOWER STRIPS IN 3 FIELDS. THE PROPORTION OF FIELD-COLLECTED LARVAE THAT WERE PARASITIZED BY C. ARETAS OR FUNGI WAS ASSESSED. AMONG THE TESTED FLORAL DIETS, BUCKWHEAT WAS SUPERIOR FOR C. ARETAS, INCREASING ITS LONGEVITY BY 1.4 TIMES COMPARED TO WATER. ALTHOUGH BUCKWHEAT ALSO INCREASED LONGEVITY OF A. COMARIANA, ITS LONGEVITY AND SURVIVAL ON BUCKWHEAT, BORAGE, AND STRAWBERRY WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT, SO BUCKWHEAT WAS CHOSEN FOR FIELD EXPERIMENTS. A. COMARIANA DENSITIES IN THE 3 FIELDS WITH SOWN BUCKWHEAT FLOWER STRIPS WERE 0.5, 4.0, AND 8.3 LARVAE PER M PER ROW OF STRAWBERRY RESPECTIVELY. OF THE COLLECTED LARVAE, A TOTAL OF 1%, 39%, AND 65% WERE PARASITIZED BY C. ARETAS, RESPECTIVELY. THE DENSITY OF A. COMARIANA AND THE PROPORTION PARASITIZED BY C. ARETAS WERE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED. DISTANCE FROM FLORAL STRIPS HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON EITHER A. COMARIANA LARVAL DENSITY OR ON THE PROPORTION OF INDIVIDUALS PARASITIZED BY C. ARETAS. FEW OTHER PARASITOIDS EMERGED FROM COLLECTED LARVAE, AND NO LARVAE WERE INFECTED BY ENTOMOPATHOGENIC FUNGI. STILL, TOTAL A. COMARIANA MORTALITY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY DISTANCE TO FLOWER STRIPS, WITH THE HIGHEST MORTALITY NEAR THE FLOWER STRIPS. AS NO EFFECT OF BUCKWHEAT FLOWER STRIPS ON C.

THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY WERE TO: 1) DETERMINE IF EFFECTIVENESS OF A FILTER STRIP CHANGES OVER YEARS SINCE ESTABLISHMENT, AND 2) DETERMINE IF TEMPORAL CHANGE DEPENDS ON VEGETATION TYPE. FOUR VEGETATION TREATMENTS WERE REPLICATED FIVE TIMES IN 3 × 7.5 M (10 × 25 FT) PLOTS. PLOTS CONTAINING ALL-GRASS (NEW GRASS) AND GRASS WITH TREES AND SHRUBS (NEW FOREST) WERE ESTABLISHED IN SPRING OF 1995 AMONG OTHERWISE SIMILAR PLOTS THAT CONTAINED EITHER GRASS SINCE CA. 1970 (OLD GRASS) OR WERE RE-CULTIVATED AND RE-PLANTED ANNUALLY WITH GRAIN SORGHUM (CROP). ONCE EACH SUMMER, IN 1995, 1996, 1997, 2003, AND 2004, IDENTICALLY PREPARED SOLUTIONS CONTAINING SEDIMENT, NITROGEN (N) AND PHOSPHORUS (P) FERTILIZER, AND BROMIDE TRACER WERE APPLIED TO THE UPPER END OF EACH PLOT DURING A SIMULATED RAINFALL EVENT OF 2.5 CM (1 IN) IN 30 MINUTES, AND THE LOAD AND CONCENTRATION OF RUNOFF COMPONENTS WERE MEASURED IN OUTFLOW FROM THE PLOTS. RETENTION OF SOLUTION COMPONENTS AND REDUCTION OF THEIR CONCENTRATIONS BY THE NEW GRASS AND NEW FOREST PLOTS IMPROVED FROM EFFECTIVENESS SIMILAR OR LESS THAN THE CROP PLOTS TO EFFECTIVENESS SIMILAR TO THE OLD GRASS PLOTS WITHIN THREE GROWING SEASONS. IMPROVEMENT COINCIDED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF DENSER VEGETATIVE GROUND COVER AND A SLOWER RATE OF RUNOFF FLOW THROUGH THE PLOTS. CHANGE IN INFILTRATION ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE IMPROVEMENT IN OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF DIVERGENCE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF NEW GRASS AND NEW FOREST PLOTS. WE CONCLUDE THAT FILTER STRIP PERFORMANCE IMPROVES OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS SINCE ESTABLISHMENT. MOST OF THE CHANGE OCCURS WITHIN THREE GROWING SEASONS AFTER ESTABLISHMENT. INFILTRATION CHARACTERISTICS ACCOUNT FOR MOST OF THAT CHANGE. GRASS AND FOREST VEGETATION ARE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE AS FILTER STRIPS FOR AT LEAST 10 GROWING SEASONS AFTER ESTABLISHMENT.","62","1","21","32","INFILTRATION (HYDROLOGY); GROWING SEASON; SORGHUM; VEGETATION TYPE; FERTILIZER; FILTER STRIP; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SURFACE RUNOFF; NITROGEN; AGRONOMY","","","","","https://www.jswconline.org/content/62/1/21.full.pdf https://www.jswconline.org/content/62/1/21 http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/ja/ja_dosskey005.pdf http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/26942 https://www.srs.fs.fed.us/pubs/26942","HTTPS://WWW.JSWCONLINE.ORG/CONTENT/62/1/21","","","2116566905","","0","000-420-455-789-45X; 002-937-270-631-538; 004-933-400-226-990; 005-046-617-641-306; 006-176-134-679-950; 009-586-998-362-572; 009-742-460-635-737; 013-487-233-481-079; 014-561-967-561-763; 017-885-841-853-429; 023-025-184-153-242; 023-889-860-756-398; 029-227-515-568-324; 032-031-027-467-560; 034-748-846-517-673; 035-134-609-293-178; 036-466-585-417-013; 038-439-180-047-201; 038-659-320-814-260; 044-401-317-828-273; 045-573-628-287-109; 056-025-688-669-098; 058-218-489-015-546; 061-560-919-049-562; 068-858-373-687-429; 073-564-601-864-691; 073-926-597-326-182; 076-826-572-086-275; 077-809-529-196-235; 084-156-857-036-757; 086-873-034-193-158; 087-142-362-977-119; 088-017-310-971-747; 088-236-621-248-724; 102-307-069-255-349; 103-148-967-328-600; 103-286-115-762-912; 104-916-636-873-124; 108-877-669-911-453; 109-376-461-877-242; 111-288-588-656-115; 111-299-180-503-936; 113-496-738-919-590; 115-642-860-718-878; 116-143-523-953-527; 123-334-480-318-27X; 134-191-656-379-548; 158-645-409-289-179; 160-843-688-361-688; 166-533-905-914-141; 170-256-364-738-510; 175-302-560-900-147; 182-906-730-748-020; 183-143-735-590-924","48","M.G.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFICIENCY OF 0-M, 3-M, 6-M AND 9-M GRASS FILTER STRIPS TO REDUCE MASSES OF DISSOLVED METOLACHLOR, ATRAZINE AND DEETHYLATRAZINE (A DEGRADATION PRODUCT OF ATRAZINE) EXPORTED IN RUNOFF. FOR THAT PURPOSE, 16 UNCULTIVATED PLOTS (3-M WIDE × 65-M LONG) WITH 0-M-, 3-M-, 6-M- AND 9-M-LONG GRASS FILTER STRIPS WERE SETUP IN A COMPLETELY RANDOMIZED BLOCK DESIGN. DURING FOUR SEASONS, MASSES OF DISSOLVED ATRAZINE, METOLACHLOR AND DEETHYLATRAZINE WERE DETERMINED FOR THE FIRST FOUR TO FIVE RAIN EVENTS, UNDER NATURAL RAIN CONDITIONS, AFTER ATRAZINE AND METOLACHLOR APPLICATION. GENERALLY, GRASS FILTER STRIPS REDUCED EXPORTED HERBICIDE MASSES BY MORE THAN 90% AND INFLUENCED ATRAZINE AND METOLACHLOR DISSIPATION KINETICS IN THE FIELD.

THEREFORE, UNDER THE PRESENT EXPERIMENTAL SOIL AND CLIMATE CONDITIONS, A GRASS FILTER STRIP OF 3 M WOULD BE A GOOD COMPROMISE BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OF SURFACE WATERS AGAINST ATRAZINE AND METOLACHLOR CONTAMINATION AND CONSERVATION OF AGRICULTURAL LAND USE.

THE EFFECT OF SAMPLING METHODS ON THE NUMBER OF HOVERFLY SPECIES AND INDIVIDUALS WAS ANALYZED. TWO SAMPLING METHODS WERE USED TO CATCH HOVERFLIES: NETTING AND PAN TRAPS. THE WHOLE SAMPLING PERIOD WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE SUBPERIODS, WHICH ARE EARLY (22ND APRIL–2ND JUNE), MIDDLE (11TH JUNE–1ST AUGUST) AND LATE (6TH AUGUST–11TH SEPTEMBER). ALTOGETHER 1,214 INDIVIDUALS OF 22 SPECIES WERE SAMPLED. FOURTEEN SPECIES WITH 78% OF INDIVIDUALS BELONGED TO THE APHIDOPHAGOUS GROUP, FEEDING ON APHIDS AS LARVAE. ALTOGETHER 861 INDIVIDUALS OF 22 HOVERFLY SPECIES WERE SAMPLED BY NETTING AND 353 INDIVIDUALS OF 10 SPECIES BY PAN TRAPS. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOVERFLY SPECIES WAS SIGNIFICANT LOWER IN THE LATE PERIOD THAN IN THE EARLY. THE TOTAL ABUNDANCE WAS HIGHER IN THE MIDDLE PERIOD COMPARED TO THE EARLY. THE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF APHIDOPHAGOUS SPECIES FOLLOWED A SIMILAR PATTERN AS THE TOTAL SPECIES VALUES. THE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF HOVERFLIES WERE SIGNIFICANT HIGHER IN 10 M AND 20 M DISTANCE IN THE WHEAT FIELD THAN ALONG THE HEDGEROW. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE PAN TRAPS WERE LESS EFFICIENT IN THE HEDGEROW THAN THE NETTING, BUT IN THE WHEAT FIELD THEY SAMPLED MORE HOVERFLIES BECAUSE OF VISUALLY ALLURING EFFECT ON HOVERFLIES IN THE ABSENCE OF FLOWERS.","69","3","381","388","POLLINATOR; LARVA; ECOLOGY; HOVERFLY; NETTING; SPECIES RICHNESS; TRANSECT; ARABLE LAND; ABUNDANCE (ECOLOGY); BIOLOGY","","","","","http://core.ac.uk/display/19563876 https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/biolog.2014.69.issue-3/s11756-013-0315-y/s11756-013-0315-y.xml https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/241115 https://link.springer.com/article/10.2478/s11756-013-0315-y https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/biolog.2014.69.issue-3/s11756-013-0315-y/s11756-013-0315-y.xml","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.2478/S11756-013-0315-Y","","10.2478/s11756-013-0315-y","2132177090","","0","000-890-614-606-582; 006-126-944-893-638; 007-243-303-723-240; 007-983-470-095-396; 009-012-164-159-153; 010-988-063-797-121; 014-065-020-413-191; 016-732-887-099-309; 018-959-906-131-888; 022-771-502-946-159; 025-162-529-099-143; 029-433-936-125-211; 032-309-609-339-669; 037-649-247-809-59X; 037-801-316-449-334; 039-622-275-777-057; 041-308-563-905-232; 043-243-299-576-545; 052-951-584-268-481; 053-611-828-022-484; 054-574-655-639-908; 056-585-869-238-25X; 062-554-425-020-511; 066-789-108-328-40X; 068-452-604-669-157; 070-573-740-499-634; 077-447-609-165-556; 080-603-556-908-327; 081-346-750-789-589; 090-065-520-860-63X; 091-274-237-112-529; 094-448-753-890-34X; 094-506-716-348-263; 098-492-558-088-638; 100-841-122-046-376; 102-475-614-737-400; 106-707-090-644-523; 107-188-835-457-613; 113-790-282-907-897; 114-519-845-592-808; 116-960-911-906-722; 126-322-219-192-539; 127-747-168-852-33X; 129-124-193-818-311; 137-105-318-357-659; 150-275-342-089-773; 161-726-640-746-005; 164-059-355-030-246; 188-074-330-681-030","7","RITA FÖLDESI; ANIKÓ KOVÁCS-HOSTYÁNSZKI","BIOLOGIA","BIOLOGIA","","LENS",0,"FÖLDESI R, 2014, BIOLOGIA","FÖLDESI R, 2014, BIOLOGIA"

WE SURVEYED THE VEGETATION OF FIELD BOUNDARIES IN ORGANIC AND NON-ORGANIC FARMS, RECORDED THE FIELD BOUNDARY TYPE AND WIDTH. WE CHARACTERIZED LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AROUND THE VEGETATION PLOTS (R = 250 M). WE CLASSIFIED PLANT SPECIES INTO TWO ECOLOGICAL RESPONSE GROUPS: (1) COMMON WEEDS AND OTHER SPECIES OCCURRING FREQUENTLY ON AGRICULTURAL LAND, I.E. ‘AGROTOLERANT SPECIES’ (47 SPECIES), AND (2) ALL OTHER SPECIES INTOLERANT TO CONTEMPORARY AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES—SO-CALLED ‘NATURE-VALUE SPECIES’ (190 SPECIES). WE ANALYSED THE EFFECT OF ORGANIC FARMING, BOUNDARY TYPE AND LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE ON THE DIVERSITY OF THESE TWO SPECIES GROUPS. WE FOUND THAT FIELD BOUNDARY TYPE AND LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE DESCRIBED MOST OF THE VARIATION IN SPECIES COMPOSITION OF THESE BOUNDARIES, WHILE ORGANIC FARMING HAD LITTLE EFFECT. HOWEVER, THE ANALYSIS OF PLANT SPECIES DIVERSITY REVEALED THAT ORGANIC FARMING SIGNIFICANTLY SUPPORTED THE SPECIES RICHNESS OF HIGH NATURE-VALUE SPECIES BY INCREASING SPECIES RICHNESS ON AVERAGE BY TWO SPECIES ON 4 M2 PLOT, WHILE THE RICHNESS OF AGROTOLERANT SPECIES DID NOT DEPEND ON FARMING TYPE. BOUNDARY TYPE HAD A SPECIFIC IMPACT ON SPECIES DIVERSITY—DITCHES ENHANCED THE RICHNESS OF NATURE-VALUE SPECIES AND SUPPRESSED AGROTOLERANTS; WOODY BOUNDARIES HOSTED ONLY A FEW AGROTOLERANT SPECIES AND ROAD VERGES INCREASED THE SPECIES RICHNESS OF BOTH SPECIES GROUPS. THE RICHNESS OF NATURE-VALUE SPECIES BENEFITED FROM WIDER OPEN BOUNDARIES, WHILE NARROW BOUNDARIES HOSTED MORE AGROTOLERANT SPECIES.","135","3","178","186","AGRICULTURE; ORGANIC FARMING; BIODIVERSITY; VEGETATION; ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; RANK ABUNDANCE CURVE; AGRICULTURAL LAND; SPECIES RICHNESS; AGROFORESTRY; SPECIES DIVERSITY","","","","","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880909002771 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103040347.html http://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND44288404 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880909002771 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103040347","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.AGEE.2009.09.005","","10.1016/j.agee.2009.09.005","1994085189","","0","003-985-399-942-102; 005-769-046-282-205; 006-209-416-467-452; 007-243-303-723-240; 008-524-220-939-553; 010-435-720-029-617; 012-187-317-384-830; 014-005-967-253-86X; 014-835-397-961-006; 015-023-911-974-997; 018-827-921-966-336; 021-177-852-241-142; 021-442-834-836-016; 022-032-010-231-027; 029-264-530-643-997; 029-386-831-957-40X; 031-579-741-921-238; 035-249-007-176-222; 038-316-745-349-398; 039-683-130-720-710; 040-851-297-121-31X; 042-985-809-167-140; 046-117-480-681-720; 046-500-604-745-231; 046-922-146-668-557; 047-546-677-833-03X; 049-774-123-059-115; 054-622-824-887-990; 054-715-078-148-813; 055-839-208-665-650; 056-099-523-856-735; 056-789-845-462-569; 057-720-330-037-206; 059-903-823-021-549; 060-708-377-821-918; 063-003-550-683-547; 063-617-276-329-073; 065-071-886-701-523; 067-354-818-441-267; 070-365-342-030-594; 073-021-383-708-605; 073-170-131-117-322; 075-521-453-779-278; 076-307-235-228-944; 080-213-693-060-517; 085-216-099-100-868; 086-525-130-009-786; 089-479-520-779-940; 095-455-937-190-024; 098-035-451-831-547; 101-656-029-176-741; 102-049-479-595-742; 108-606-742-009-569; 112-169-660-713-159; 115-161-489-792-477; 117-345-687-903-78X; 121-206-630-992-202; 121-270-336-123-002; 130-698-554-759-854; 131-060-331-668-772; 138-312-614-366-937; 141-005-140-982-524; 144-887-196-579-407; 145-863-435-046-625; 147-712-556-583-085; 150-062-616-431-988; 150-827-413-891-88X; 151-368-087-827-60X; 152-084-233-033-659; 152-601-901-059-68X; 155-691-175-864-748; 160-781-907-593-622; 161-072-580-272-396; 166-826-142-461-007; 167-196-987-930-306; 175-927-412-841-616; 176-506-367-701-104; 176-664-883-657-81X; 180-157-128-386-145; 184-621-408-258-203; 186-739-979-596-835; 187-941-892-082-802; 188-468-956-254-948; 188-597-703-306-560","55","TSIPE AAVIK; JAAN LIIRA","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","","LENS",0,"AAVIK T, 2010, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","AAVIK T, 2010, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT"

HOWEVER, THERE IS THE NEED TO INVESTIGATE THEIR ROLE IN INTENSIVE FARMING SYSTEMS WHERE A REALISTIC AND SHAREABLE PROPOSAL TO REALIZE BUFFER STRIPS CAN ONLY FORESEE THE USE OF A LIMITED SPACE. WE EVALUATED THE NITROGEN BUFFERING CAPACITIES OF TWO NARROW RIPARIAN STRIPS (5–8 M) ALONG IRRIGATION DITCHES LOCATED IN A TYPICAL FLAT AGRICULTURAL WATERSHED OF THE ALLUVIAL PLAIN OF THE RIVER PO (NORTHERN ITALY). SUBSURFACE WATER LEVEL AND NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS WERE MONITORED ALONG TRANSECTS OF PIEZOMETERS INSTALLED FROM CROP FIELDS TO DITCHES IN TWO DIFFERENT AREAS. SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATION IN WATER CHEMISTRY AND HYDROLOGY WERE INVESTIGATED TO INDIVIDUATE THE MAIN PROCESSES (BIOLOGICAL OR PHYSICAL) LEADING TO GROUNDWATER NITRATE DEPLETION RELATED TO FERTILIZATION, PLUVIOMETRIC REGIME AND SEASONAL VARIATION. THE RESULTS OBTAINED INDICATE AN ELEVATED NITRATE REMOVAL EFFICIENCY IN BOTH RIPARIAN AREAS. COMPARED TO THE HIGH MEAN CONCENTRATIONS MEASURED AT THE EXIT OF THE CROP FIELDS (10–90 MG L−1 N-NO3−), NITRATE LEVELS WITHIN RIPARIAN SITES CAN BE VERY LOW, COMPLETELY DISAPPEARING BELOW THE DITCHES. THE PATTERNS OF SOME CHEMICAL SPECIES (O2, SO42− AND HCO3−) AND THE POTENTIAL DENITRIFICATION RATES SUGGEST THAT DENITRIFICATION PLAYS A PREDOMINANT ROLE IN THE N-NO3− DEPLETION OBSERVED IN THE FIRST FEW METERS OF THE HERBACEOUS STRIP. THE KEY FACTORS IN THE SYSTEM ARE THE ELEVATED GROUNDWATER RESIDENCE TIME AND THE EFFECT OF THE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION. THE WATER UPTAKE BY WOODY VEGETATION AFFECTS THE SUBSURFACE WATER TO FLOW THROUGH THE RIPARIAN ZONE AND, AT THE SAME TIME, IT CONTRIBUTES TO COMPLETELY REMOVE THE NITRATE FROM THE GROUNDWATER. OUR FINDINGS ALSO SUGGEST THE DOUBLE ROLE OF RIPARIAN VEGETATION BOTH IN ECOHYDROLOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TERMS. IN FACT THE WATER UPTAKE BY TREES AFFECTS THE SUBSURFACE FLOW PATTERN AND CONTRIBUTES TO COMPLETELY REMOVE THE NITRATE IN THE RIPARIAN ZONE.","37","2","148","157","SUBSURFACE FLOW; RIPARIAN ZONE; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; NITRATE; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; BUFFER STRIP; DENITRIFICATION; GROUNDWATER; HYDROLOGY (AGRICULTURE); ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857410002582 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/843423 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857410002582","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.ECOLENG.2010.08.003","","10.1016/j.ecoleng.2010.08.003","2006501585","","0","000-600-406-746-566; 001-699-479-136-901; 002-321-610-856-114; 007-647-947-577-550; 008-467-759-539-985; 014-286-035-791-303; 014-316-223-277-453; 016-848-985-349-10X; 017-709-159-607-177; 019-956-026-948-622; 020-162-258-114-150; 025-790-337-809-216; 035-331-375-703-965; 036-177-171-687-91X; 039-471-920-005-67X; 044-456-125-092-896; 051-607-714-466-701; 052-494-986-045-941; 059-949-847-321-259; 063-921-186-022-381; 067-470-331-652-132; 073-703-019-282-474; 075-429-883-991-330; 075-611-331-410-172; 076-551-861-300-215; 078-812-044-832-284; 080-589-148-600-106; 101-504-801-125-323; 102-901-034-424-714; 126-051-201-417-566; 129-149-313-308-705; 133-007-756-045-351; 147-839-315-927-543; 150-539-908-471-485; 156-008-705-075-664; 164-811-124-878-023; 168-228-690-607-508; 179-775-405-073-482; 186-231-509-533-744","45","RAFFAELLA BALESTRINI; CRISTINA ARESE; CARLO ANDREA DELCONTE; ALESSANDRO LOTTI; FRANCO SALERNO","ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING","ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING","","LENS",0,"BALESTRINI R, 2011, ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING","BALESTRINI R, 2011, ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING"

AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION AND EXPANSION ARE REGARDED AS MAJOR CAUSES OF WORLDWIDE DECLINES IN BIODIVERSITY DURING THE LAST CENTURY. AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES (AES) HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN MANY COUNTRIES AS AN ATTEMPT TO COUNTERACT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE BY PROVIDING FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR FARMERS TO ADOPT ENVIRONMENTALLY-SENSITIVE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. 2. WE SURVEYED 18 PAIRS OF AES AND CONVENTIONALLY-MANAGED FARMS IN CENTRAL SCOTLAND (UNITED KINGDOM) TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF SPECIFIC AES MANAGEMENT PRESCRIPTIONS (FIELD MARGINS, HEDGEROWS, SPECIES-RICH GRASSLANDS AND WATER MARGINS) ON FARMLAND MOTHS. WE ALSO MEASURED THE INFLUENCE OF THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE ON MOTH POPULATIONS AT THREE SPATIAL SCALES (250 M, 500 M AND 1 KM RADII FROM EACH TRAPPING SITE) TO ASSESS AT WHICH SCALE MANAGEMENT WAS MOST IMPORTANT FOR THE CONSERVATION OF FARMLAND MOTHS. 3. IN GENERAL, PERCENTAGE COVER OF ROUGH GRASSLAND AND SCRUB WITHIN 250 M OF THE TRAPPING SITE WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT LANDSCAPE PREDICTOR FOR BOTH MICRO- AND MACROMOTH ABUNDANCE AND MACROMOTH SPECIES RICHNESS, ALTHOUGH NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF URBANIZATION WERE FOUND AT WIDER SCALES (WITHIN 1 KM), PARTICULARLY FOR MACROMOTH SPECIES RICHNESS. 4. THE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF MICROMOTHS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER WITHIN FIELD MARGINS AND SPECIES-RICH GRASSLANDS UNDER AES MANAGEMENT IN COMPARISON TO THEIR CONVENTIONAL COUNTERPARTS, WHEREAS AES WATER MARGINS INCREASED MICROMOTH ABUNDANCE, BUT NOT SPECIES RICHNESS. AES SPECIES-RICH GRASSLANDS AND WATER MARGINS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED MACROMOTH ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS, AND MACROMOTHS CONSIDERED 'WIDESPREAD BUT RAPIDLY DECLINING' ALSO GAINED SOME BENEFITS FROM THESE TWO AES PRESCRIPTIONS. IN CONTRAST, HEDGEROWS UNDER AES MANAGEMENT ENHANCED NEITHER MICROMOTH NOR MACROMOTH POPULATIONS. 5. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT INCREASING THE PERCENTAGE COVER OF SEMI-NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AT A LOCAL SCALE (E.G. WITHIN 250 M) BENEFITS BOTH MICRO- AND MACROMOTH POPULATIONS, AND THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SIMPLE AES MANAGEMENT PRESCRIPTIONS APPLIED TO RELATIVELY SMALL AREAS CAN INCREASE THE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF MOTH POPULATIONS IN AGRICULTURAL ENVIRONMENTS. © 2010 THE AUTHORS.

THE PAPER PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS OF BS AND REVIEWS THE MORE IMPORTANT DATA FROM RESEARCH PROGRAMMES CONDUCTED OVER THE LAST DECADE IN VENETO REGION (NORTH-EAST ITALY). OVER A PERIOD OF 3-5 YEARS, IN TWO EXPERIMENTAL SITES, YOUNG BS REDUCED TOTAL RUNOFF BY 33%, LOSSES OF N BY 44% AND P BY 50% COMPARED TO NO-BS. A MATURE BS WAS ABLE TO ABATE BOTH NO3-N AND DISSOLVED PHOSPHORUS CONCENTRATIONS BY ALMOST 100%, IN MOST CASES HAVING EXITING WATER THAT SATISFIED THE LIMIT FOR AVOIDING EUTROPHICATION. THE BS ALSO PROVED TO BE A USEFUL BARRIER FOR HERBICIDES, WITH CONCENTRATIONS ABATED BY 60% AND 90%, DEPENDING ON THE CHEMICAL AND THE TIME ELAPSED SINCE APPLICATION.

FOUR REPLICATE MARGINS ON ARABLE LAND EACH CONTAINED FIVE TREATMENT PLOTS 72 M LONG BY 6 M WIDE. THE TREATMENTS WERE: (1) CROPPED TO THE EDGE; (2) SOWN ‘TUSSOCKY’ GRASS MIX; (3) SOWN ‘GRASS AND WILDFLOWER’ MIX; (4) SPLIT MARGIN (3 M ‘TUSSOCKY’ GRASS ADJACENT TO HEDGE AND 3 M ‘GRASS AND WILDFLOWER’ NEXT TO CROP); AND (5) NATURAL REGENERATION. INVERTEBRATES WERE SAMPLED BY PITFALL TRAPPING, SWEEP NETTING, AND BUTTERFLY AND BUMBLEBEE TRANSECTS, AND IDENTIFIED TO SPECIES LEVEL. THE USE OF DIFFERENT FLOWER SPECIES BY FORAGING BUMBLEBEES WAS ALSO EXAMINED. DESPITE ALL TREATMENTS CONTAINING A FLUSH OF ANNUAL WEEDS EARLY IN THE ESTABLISHMENT YEAR, THE FIVE MARGIN TYPES WERE DISTINCT IN THEIR VEGETATION COMPOSITION BY THEIR FIRST MID-SUMMER. WHERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RESULTS WERE OBTAINED FOR INVERTEBRATES, AVOIDANCE OF THE ‘CROPPED’ TREATMENT WAS BY FAR THE COMMONEST OBSERVED RESPONSE. THIS TENDENCY COULD BE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED AMONGST THE CARABIDS, SPIDERS, BUTTERFLIES, BUMBLEBEES, MILLIPEDES AND HARVESTMEN, WITH MARGINS OFTEN CONTAINING DOUBLE OR MORE THE NUMBER OF INVERTEBRATES OF SIMILAR AREAS CROPPED TO THE EDGE. HAVING AVOIDED THE CROP, PREFERENCES FOR OTHER MARGIN TYPES WERE MIXED, BUT THERE WAS A MARKED TENDENCY BY MANY NECTAR AND/OR POLLEN-FEEDING, FLYING INSECTS TOWARDS GREATER ABUNDANCE ON THOSE MARGINS CONTAINING SOWN ‘WILDFLOWERS’ (E.G. BUTTERFLIES MEADOW BROWN AND RINGLET, BUMBLEBEES, POLLEN BEETLE MELIGETHES SP.) OR FLOWERS EITHER SOWN OR UNSOWN (SOLDIER BEETLE RHAGONYCHA FULVA ). THERE WAS A LESS STRONG TENDENCY FOR PREDATORY SPECIES OCCURRING IN THE VEGETATION CANOPY AND DEPENDING ON SMALL, ESPECIALLY FLYING INSECTS FOR FOOD, TO ALSO PREFER THE FLOWERY TREATMENTS (E.G. TOTAL SPIDERS CAUGHT BY SWEEPING, SEVEN-SPOT LADYBIRD). HARVESTMEN IN AUTUMN REJECT NATURAL REGENERATION IN FAVOUR OF ANY SOWN TREATMENT. ONLY ONE SPECIES, THE CARABID NEBRIA BREVICOLLIS , WAS TRAPPED IN HIGHER NUMBERS IN THE CROPPED TREATMENT THAN ON ANY SOWN MARGIN, AND THEN ONLY IN AUTUMN. OF THE SIX COMMON BUMBLEBEE SPECIES, THE TWO LONGEST-TONGUED SPECIES SHOWED DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF FLOWER VISITATION FROM THE REMAINING FOUR. THESE RESULTS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THAT SOWN FIELD MARGINS CAN RAPIDLY PRODUCE SUBSTANTIAL BIODIVERSITY BENEFITS ON ARABLE LAND, WITH THE RESULTING FAUNA INFLUENCED BY THE TYPE OF FIELD MARGIN CREATED.","106","2","259","271","FAUNA; BIODIVERSITY; NECTAR; ECOLOGY; BUMBLEBEE; WILDFLOWER; NEBRIA BREVICOLLIS; SOLDIER BEETLE; SPECIES DIVERSITY; BIOLOGY","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000632070100252X http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632070100252X","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/S0006-3207(01)00252-X","","10.1016/s0006-3207(01)00252-x","2037879773","","0","007-827-850-871-938; 014-809-297-009-430; 015-522-490-223-197; 020-713-595-267-906; 030-652-847-337-20X; 044-050-646-677-718; 056-892-041-411-85X; 058-105-561-757-413; 061-255-779-212-020; 077-623-747-437-53X; 078-068-143-214-104; 079-068-774-342-74X; 080-139-567-968-521; 087-186-786-234-321; 088-089-591-331-916; 104-824-287-195-100; 105-466-690-006-049; 111-564-806-763-612; 131-508-903-583-735; 142-547-556-180-595; 155-264-691-522-430; 170-044-763-432-805; 171-352-683-438-394","231","BILL MEEK; DICK LOXTON; TIM H.

IT IS STILL UNCLEAR, HOWEVER, WHICH HEDGEROW HABITATS HAVE THE BEST POTENTIAL OF SUPPORTING DIVERSE FOREST HERB COMMUNITIES, MAKING IT HARD TO TARGET PARTICULAR STRUCTURES FOR CONSERVATION. OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO IDENTIFY THE LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS OF HEDGEROWS THAT COULD HELP PREDICT THEIR POTENTIAL AT MAXIMIZING THE RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE, AND DIVERSITY OF NATIVE FOREST HERBS OF TEMPERATE DECIDUOUS FORESTS OF NORTH-EAST AMERICA. WE USED MULTIPLE REGRESSION, MORAN’I CORRELOGRAMS, AND CONDITIONAL AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF LANDSCAPE AND HISTORICAL VARIABLES (HEDGEROW AGE, AMOUNT OF ADJACENT FOREST COVER, CONNECTION TO FORESTS AND OTHER HEDGEROWS) AND OF LOCAL VARIABLES (HEDGEROW WIDTH, CANOPY COVER, COVER OF OTHER SPECIES) ON THE RESPONSE VARIABLES. THE RESULTS SHOW AN INCREASE IN FOREST HERB DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE IN HEDGEROWS WITH TIME AND WITH INCREASING NEARBY FOREST COVER. LOCAL FACTORS SUCH AS GREATER WIDTH AND REDUCED COVER OF OTHER SPECIES ALSO RELATE TO A GREATER ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF FOREST HERBS IN LINEAR HABITATS. THE FACT THAT FOREST HERB COMMUNITIES CAN REASSEMBLE IN HEDGEROW CORRIDORS WITH TIME IMPLIES THAT THERE COULD BE LONG-TERM BENEFITS IN MAINTAINING AND EVEN CREATING LINEAR HABITATS WHERE THERE IS A POOL OF DISPERSING FOREST HERBS.","141","1","298","307","CANOPY; OLD-GROWTH FOREST; BIODIVERSITY; TEMPERATE DECIDUOUS FOREST; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; SPECIES RICHNESS; AGROFORESTRY; AGROECOSYSTEM; ABUNDANCE (ECOLOGY)","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320707004090 https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND44019832","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.BIOCON.2007.10.003","","10.1016/j.biocon.2007.10.003","2158924568","","0","004-931-123-113-576; 007-221-361-423-978; 007-361-282-044-640; 007-571-395-247-941; 010-949-194-518-91X; 011-185-071-186-782; 011-817-622-257-771; 013-210-533-072-945; 018-300-493-662-705; 018-359-440-164-725; 018-463-393-074-304; 022-253-628-718-442; 026-450-244-324-768; 026-926-325-058-247; 028-260-567-737-933; 031-712-522-366-166; 032-328-441-523-30X; 037-979-273-547-994; 038-822-325-960-838; 040-058-016-041-863; 042-525-991-664-938; 043-510-003-480-725; 045-646-010-060-089; 046-117-480-681-720; 046-595-945-408-676; 046-662-847-447-759; 047-130-476-878-70X; 051-075-307-068-357; 051-197-969-663-775; 054-328-419-977-493; 055-551-318-921-640; 063-207-503-700-767; 065-172-604-775-608; 069-384-032-928-970; 071-601-864-758-089; 073-668-140-241-403; 073-798-803-161-275; 074-151-454-931-065; 075-182-328-430-399; 079-916-118-520-017; 083-199-823-871-264; 086-380-640-184-897; 094-234-240-781-128; 095-350-099-081-855; 096-074-282-606-638; 096-835-160-953-686; 097-076-798-843-218; 098-520-454-909-513; 098-889-499-768-531; 100-565-254-478-439; 108-184-742-497-745; 108-586-996-670-001; 123-117-631-521-216; 125-703-290-888-953; 128-463-822-517-061; 131-556-321-215-613; 136-453-842-687-376; 139-621-249-823-41X; 148-422-686-545-715; 149-673-684-724-149; 160-779-095-696-518; 166-153-854-096-315; 172-560-580-560-47X; 174-103-363-317-763; 180-721-397-650-279; 182-505-603-837-437","55","VALÉRIE ROY; SYLVIE DE BLOIS","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","","LENS",0,"ROY V, 2008, BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","ROY V, 2008, BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION"

THE MAIN AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE (I) TO INVESTIGATE HOW FOUR HEDGE STAND TYPES, I.E., SYSTEMS OF MANAGEMENT DISTINGUISHED ON THE BASIS OF THE NATURAL AND MANAGED GROWTH FORMS OF TREES AND SHRUBS (LOW SINGLE-STORIED, HIGH SINGLE-STORIED, TWO-STORIED AND MULTI-STORIED), DIFFER IN THEIR BIOMETRIC PARAMETERS AND (II) TO IDENTIFY THE PRIMARY MANAGEMENT-RELATED DETERMINANTS OF NATIVE WOODY SPECIES RICHNESS. THE STUDY USED A LARGE DATASET OF HEDGEROWS (N=538) SAMPLED IN SEVEN SITES IN NORTHERN ITALY. THE FOUR HEDGE STAND TYPES EXHIBITED HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SIZE AND BIOMETRIC PARAMETERS. THE MULTI-STORIED HEDGES, ASSOCIATED WITH THE HIGHEST STAND STRUCTURAL DIVERSITY INDEX VALUES, SUPPORTED THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF TREE SPECIES, FOLLOWED BY HIGH SINGLE-STORIED HEDGES. THE LOW SINGLE-STORIED HEDGE STAND TYPE CONTAINED THE LOWEST NUMBER OF SPECIES. WE FOUND A POSITIVE EFFECT OF HEDGE AREA AS WELL AS A MARGINAL NEGATIVE EFFECT OF BASAL AREA ON NATIVE WOODY SPECIES RICHNESS. THE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS ADDRESSED BY OUR STUDY INCLUDE CONVERSION OF SINGLE-STORIED INTO TWO- OR MULTI-STORIED TYPES, INCREASING HEDGE SIZE AND CONTROLLING HEDGE STAND BASAL AREA.","6","4","201","208","AGRICULTURE; HEDGE (FINANCE); BIODIVERSITY; DEAD HEDGE; FIELD (GEOGRAPHY); GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY; ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; SPECIES RICHNESS; BASAL AREA","","","","","https://iforest.sisef.org/contents/?id=ifor0749-006 https://iforest.sisef.org/pdf/?id=ifor0749-006 http://www.sisef.it/iforest/contents/?id=ifor0749-006 http://www.sisef.it/iforest/pdf/?id=ifor0749-006 https://core.ac.uk/display/53497125 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cattaneo_Dina/publication/237008587_Assessment_of_hedge_stand_types_as_determinants_of_woody_species_richness_in_rural_field_margins/links/0c96051ae09b7d3a35000000.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.3832/IFOR0749-006","","10.3832/ifor0749-006","2035578995","","0","000-329-241-681-366; 002-234-862-186-238; 007-513-938-529-086; 008-532-010-264-113; 011-175-232-330-433; 011-749-588-004-356; 011-813-364-108-969; 016-915-486-723-598; 016-944-193-681-825; 018-023-127-841-209; 020-670-103-284-949; 023-360-149-157-668; 023-935-502-746-047; 030-490-805-553-423; 031-335-116-917-830; 033-007-577-863-88X; 034-366-554-328-48X; 038-361-105-216-688; 039-524-631-746-697; 043-315-725-758-49X; 045-445-063-674-649; 047-130-476-878-70X; 047-949-455-932-004; 048-704-737-253-297; 050-221-705-163-68X; 050-532-464-266-167; 052-951-584-268-481; 053-364-624-635-937; 056-853-001-254-085; 057-122-180-983-992; 060-009-962-481-27X; 062-441-837-157-062; 068-452-604-669-157; 070-997-856-493-073; 071-601-656-233-384; 072-224-176-896-782; 073-798-803-161-275; 084-896-198-252-512; 086-026-725-403-460; 086-377-939-570-007; 088-934-637-295-013; 089-185-474-387-677; 089-601-345-641-026; 096-253-286-951-280; 101-150-316-380-050; 115-742-892-181-305; 118-027-534-280-035; 123-524-226-005-021; 134-362-031-188-18X; 144-650-014-019-56X; 154-750-119-428-838; 156-624-196-949-616; 161-425-757-559-60X; 183-783-359-943-428; 187-050-769-304-212; 195-877-107-571-018; 196-902-964-847-590","14","TOMMASO SITZIA; GIOVANNI TRENTANOVI; LORENZO MARINI; DINA CATTANEO; PAOLO SEMENZATO","IFOREST - BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY","IFOREST - BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY","","LENS",0,"SITZIA T, 2013, IFOREST - BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY","SITZIA T, 2013, IFOREST - BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY"

AMONG THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT, THERE WAS THE DETERMINATION OF CHANGE IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE MICROBIAL POPULATIONS OF SOIL OF THE WOODED RIPARIAN STRIP. THE COMPOSITION OF THE BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES COLLECTED AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE RIPARIAN STRIP WAS DETERMINED BY COMBINED APPROACHES INVOLVING CULTIVATION (CFU), MICROSCOPIC APPROACHES (CTC TEST), AND DNA-BASED TECHNIQUES (ARDRA AND DGGE). THE SIZE OF THE LIVING POPULATION WAS THE SAME INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE EXPERIMENTAL STRIP, WITH A MINOR PERCENTAGE OF CULTURABLE BACTERIA. HIGHER NUMBERS OF METABOLICALLY ACTIVE BACTERIA AND HIGHER BACTERIAL DIVERSITY WERE DETECTED IN THE INTERNAL SOIL, WITH DEEPER SOIL LAYERS SHOWING REDUCED DIVERSITY, THUS INDICATING THAT SOIL MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE RIPARIAN STRIP EFFECTIVELY SUPPORTS THE VIABILITY OF BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES. TOTAL OPERATIONAL TAXONOMIC UNITS (OTUS) AND PERCENTAGE OF SINGLE OTUS WERE ALSO FOUND TO BE ALWAYS HIGHER IN THE INTERNAL SOIL SAMPLES FOR ALL SOIL LAYERS, WITH THE PERCENTAGE OF FIRMICUTES INCREASING AND ACTINOBACTERIA DECREASING WITH DEPTH. THE INCREASING SOIL ORGANIC CARBON INPUTS DUE TO THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE GROWING PLANTS WERE FOUND TO SUPPORT BACTERIAL DIVERSITY IN ALL SOIL LAYERS.

THIS STUDY EXAMINED HOW DIFFERENT CARABID SPECIES WERE DISTRIBUTED IN FIELD AND FIELD MARGIN HABITATS, AND ANALYSED THEIR SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS.; ; 2;  WE SAMPLED 156 LOCATIONS IN A GRID OF PITFALL TRAPS OVER APPROXIMATELY 1 HA, COMPRISING A HEDGEROW AND ADJACENT PARTS OF TWO ARABLE FIELDS. TRAPS WERE MONITORED BETWEEN JUNE AND NOVEMBER 1994 TO PROVIDE DATA WITH HIGH SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION OF THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF SIX CARABID BEETLE TAXA.; ; 3;  THE PATTERN OF CARABID ACTIVITY-DENSITY OVER THE EXPERIMENTAL SITE WAS DISPLAYED IN A SERIES OF CONTOUR PLOTS. SPATIAL ANALYSES BY DISTANCE INDICES (SADIE) WERE USED TO PROVIDE AGGREGATION INDICES (IA) FOR THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF CARABID SPECIES AT DIFFERENT TIMES.; ; 4; A SECOND SADIE INDEX (IM) OF SPATIAL ASSOCIATION BETWEEN TWO SETS OF COUNTS WAS USED TO MEASURE THE SPATIAL STABILITY OF SPECIES’ AGGREGATION PATTERNS THROUGH TIME. IM WAS ALSO USED TO MEASURE ASSOCIATION OR DISSOCIATION BETWEEN THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF DIFFERENT SPECIES, AND THE SPATIAL ASSOCIATION BETWEEN A SPECIES’ DISTRIBUTION AND AN ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLE.; ; 5;  EACH TAXON WAS AGGREGATED MOST OF THE TIME, BUT DIFFERENT TAXA AGGREGATED IN PATCHES WITHIN THE FIELD AND/OR HEDGEROW TO DIFFERENT AND VARYING EXTENTS. THE FIELD BOUNDARIES WERE IMPORTANT FOR SOME SPECIES, EITHER AS THE ONLY HABITAT IN WHICH THEY OCCURRED (AMARA SPP.), AS THE MAJOR FOCUS OF MORE WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION (HARPALUS RUFIPES), OR AS A SEASONAL REFUGE (NEBRIA BREVICOLLIS). WITHIN THE CROP HABITAT, DIFFERENT SPECIES ALSO OCCUPIED DIFFERENT AREAS, PROVIDING SOME EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST SPECIES PACKING IN SPACE.; ; 6;  SPATIAL DISTRIBUTIONS BETWEEN CONSECUTIVE SAMPLES WERE STRONGLY AND POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED, INDICATING STABILITY OF PATCH LOCATION OVER SHORT TIME-SCALES. THE STRENGTH OF THE ASSOCIATION IN TURN WAS CORRELATED WITH ACTIVITY-DENSITY. WHEN TIME LAGS WERE INTRODUCED BETWEEN SAMPLE DISTRIBUTIONS, SOME NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION INDICES INDICATED DISPLACEMENT OF PATCHES. IN MOST CASES, HOWEVER, POSITIVE ASSOCIATION WAS MAINTAINED OVER LONG PERIODS, DEMONSTRATING PATCH STABILITY.; ; 7;  THE SPATIAL STABILITY OF PATCHES SUGGESTS THAT FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD FOCUS ON THE DETAILED MEASUREMENT OF BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH PATCH LOCATION. IDENTIFYING THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF POPULATION DISTRIBUTIONS IN FARMLAND HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR MANAGING HABITAT TO ENHANCE POPULATIONS OF BENEFICIAL PREDATORS, AND TARGETING INSECTICIDE APPLICATIONS IN PRECISION AGRICULTURE TO MINIMIZE THEIR ADVERSE SIDE-EFFECTS.","38","1","100","116","ABIOTIC COMPONENT; FIELD (GEOGRAPHY); HABITAT; ECOLOGY; HARPALUS RUFIPES; SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION; NEBRIA BREVICOLLIS; STABILITY (PROBABILITY); TAXON; BIOLOGY","","","","","https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00574.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00574.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00574.x/full https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND604258032","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1046/J.1365-2664.2001.00574.X","","10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00574.x","2080568963","","0","002-840-565-989-288; 005-477-965-388-217; 009-120-913-363-96X; 010-888-549-334-33X; 013-963-655-119-437; 014-571-735-949-397; 014-809-297-009-430; 014-945-646-073-964; 015-745-674-744-948; 020-831-252-589-740; 021-461-514-781-574; 021-462-701-059-231; 036-171-649-939-905; 037-241-390-682-529; 037-731-106-378-493; 041-946-823-120-543; 042-287-420-054-457; 043-329-639-022-790; 044-050-646-677-718; 046-117-070-832-020; 047-474-865-839-244; 047-591-108-263-658; 054-095-333-888-006; 056-892-041-411-85X; 058-098-786-154-557; 063-289-521-238-627; 069-622-233-079-646; 073-332-568-126-247; 080-139-567-968-521; 083-113-612-315-815; 092-387-691-527-318; 099-176-314-169-767; 103-574-740-960-136; 109-335-442-828-436; 109-407-548-674-770; 110-684-291-574-379; 118-423-406-852-101; 120-514-812-606-235; 122-593-714-312-795; 128-918-101-050-930; 133-540-484-254-808; 135-300-924-298-24X; 142-906-704-148-354; 157-255-319-968-581; 186-464-257-554-721; 194-482-255-430-935; 194-859-575-207-30X","197","THOMAS C.F.G.; L.

RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIPS CAN EFFECTIVELY REMOVE SEDIMENT AND NUTRIENTS FROM SURFACE RUNOFF. A FIELD-SCALE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTEGRATED POPLAR (POPULUS)-GRASS BUFFER STRIPS WITH DIFFERENT TREE PLANTING DENSITY IN REDUCING SEDIMENT, N, AND P FROM AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF DURING NATURAL RAINFALL EVENTS IN TAIHU LAKE WATERSHED, EASTERN CHINA. THE EXPERIMENTAL SITE CONSISTED OF FOUR TREATMENTS, INCLUDING A CONTROL PLOT WITH NO BUFFER STRIP (T0) AND THREE POPLAR-GRASS BUFFER STRIPS WITH DIFFERENT PLANTING DENSITIES OF 1,346 TREES HA−1 (T1), 769 TREES HA−1 (T2), AND 577 TREES HA−1 (T3) WITH PLANTING SPACING OF 2 × 5 M (6.5 × 16.4 FT), 4 × 5 M (13.1 × 16.4 FT), AND 6 × 5 M (19.7 × 16.4 FT), RESPECTIVELY. THE INTEGRATED POPLAR-GRASS BUFFER STRIPS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED RUNOFF VOLUME, SEDIMENT, TOTAL N, AND TOTAL P MASSES BY 49.3% TO 61.6%, 78.7% TO 90.2%, 57.2% TO 71.5%, AND 65.4% TO 81.4%, RESPECTIVELY. WITH INCREASING POPLAR PLANTING DENSITY IN BUFFER STRIPS, THE CANOPY INTERCEPTION AND MAXIMUM WATER STORAGE CAPACITY OF LITTER LAYER INCREASED, WHILE THE LOSS OF SEDIMENTS AND NUTRIENTS FROM RUNOFF DECREASED. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REMOVAL EFFICIENCY IN BUFFER T1 THAN THAT IN BUFFERS T2 AND T3 FOR SEDIMENT, PARTICLE-BOUND N (PN), AND PARTICLE-BOUND P (PP). THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN REMOVAL EFFICIENCY FOR AMMONIUM AS N (NH4-N), NITRATE AS N (NO3-N), AND PHOSPHATE P (PO4-P) BETWEEN BUFFERS T1 AND T2. ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT RAINFALL REGIMES, WE FOUND THAT THE REDUCTION IN RUNOFF VOLUME, SEDIMENT, AND NUTRIENTS LOAD FOR BUFFERS WERE HIGHER UNDER MILD-LONG DURATION EVENTS (RAINFALL INTENSITY CLASS 2 TO 4 MM H−1 [0.078 TO 0.15 IN HR−1]) AND LOWER UNDER INTENSE-SHORT DURATION EVENTS (RAINFALL INTENSITY CLASS 6 TO 8 MM H−1 [0.23 TO 0.31 IN HR−1]). THE REMOVAL EFFICIENCY OF THE BUFFERS WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH BOTH PRECIPITATION AND RAINFALL INTENSITY, AND THE RAINFALL INTENSITY HAD MORE EFFECT ON THE REMOVAL EFFICIENCY THAN THE PRECIPITATION. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE IMPACT OF TREE PLANTING DENSITY ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BUFFER STRIPS DEPENDED ON THE MEASURED PARAMETER. THAT IS, THE IMPACT ON SEDIMENT, PN, AND PP WAS GREATER THAN THAT ON THE SOLUBLE N AND P. THE EFFECT OF TREE PLANTING DENSITY ON THE PERFORMANCE OF BUFFER STRIPS IS MAINLY DUE TO THE INTERCEPTION OF CANOPY AND LITTER LAYER.","71","2","129","136","RIPARIAN ZONE; EUTROPHICATION; CANOPY INTERCEPTION; RIPARIAN BUFFER; SEDIMENT; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; BUFFER STRIP; SURFACE RUNOFF; INTERCEPTION","","","","","https://www.jswconline.org/content/71/2/129 https://www.jswconline.org/content/71/2/129.refs","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.2489/JSWC.71.2.129","","10.2489/jswc.71.2.129","2307069623","","0","008-380-052-396-94X; 010-151-054-506-703; 013-102-351-520-868; 013-487-233-481-079; 025-960-744-067-693; 028-802-252-344-012; 030-682-084-703-597; 036-060-922-824-075; 037-204-088-505-975; 044-982-906-041-039; 045-878-014-461-966; 054-943-080-161-413; 064-675-123-853-466; 070-129-859-863-682; 074-251-282-539-46X; 075-834-457-354-928; 076-574-109-431-630; 082-797-391-654-568; 087-333-571-914-458; 099-719-046-892-307; 105-984-333-519-882; 111-288-588-656-115; 115-642-860-718-878; 116-445-845-636-106; 117-095-370-385-460; 151-627-024-143-052; 164-037-026-126-506; 167-265-236-780-171; 178-790-415-022-573; 181-090-792-931-175","4","X.L.

IN ORDER TO SHOW THE EFFECTS OF HEDGEROW REMOVAL ON SUMMER MEDITERRANEAN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN RURAL LANDSCAPES, THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A COMPARISON OF SOME KEY ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS BETWEEN AREAS WHERE HEDGEROWS ARE STILL PRESENT, COMPARED TO AREAS WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED. THROUGH A TWO-WAY ANOVA, IT WAS FOUND THAT TEMPERATURES IN THE HEDGEROWS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN THE FIELDS, WHILST AIR TEMPERATURES BENEATH THE HEDGEROWS WERE LOWER, AND STEADIER, THAN THOSE OF SURROUNDING AREAS. WHEN TEMPERATURES OF THE FIELDS WERE COMPARED TO THOSE SITES WHERE HEDGEROWS HAD BEEN REMOVED, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN TEMPERATURES WERE DETECTED BELOWGROUND AND SOMETIMES AT SOIL SURFACE LEVEL BUT NOT AT HIGHER LEVELS. THE LEVELS OF SOIL WATER CONTENT AND ORGANIC CARBON WERE HIGHER WHERE HEDGEROWS WERE STILL IN PLACE. THESE DIFFERENCES INDICATE POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS DUE TO HEDGEROW REMOVAL. THE IMPLICATIONS OF HEDGEROW CONSERVATION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND FOR CROPLAND PRODUCTIVITY ARE DISCUSSED.","78","1","13","25","PRODUCTIVITY (ECOLOGY); SOIL WATER; SOIL ORGANIC MATTER; HEDGEROW REMOVAL; MICROCLIMATE; ECOLOGICAL STABILITY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SOIL CARBON; MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE; AGROFORESTRY","","","","","https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103046531 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-009-9224-z https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10457-009-9224-z https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-009-9224-z/fulltext.html http://nectar.northampton.ac.uk/3010/ https://pure.northampton.ac.uk/en/publications/the-effect-of-hedgerow-loss-on-microclimate-in-the-mediterranean-","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1007/S10457-009-9224-Z","","10.1007/s10457-009-9224-z","2098992937","","0","000-859-859-510-858; 004-259-813-635-301; 006-014-553-266-593; 007-513-938-529-086; 009-104-527-591-059; 011-055-691-850-597; 013-537-827-071-969; 015-606-762-402-796; 019-945-094-134-221; 021-951-510-082-145; 022-427-169-113-379; 024-369-018-626-02X; 024-766-267-051-035; 025-296-906-047-191; 026-138-277-832-99X; 027-554-288-342-119; 027-794-497-211-644; 028-917-029-117-685; 029-878-765-640-703; 029-904-475-177-008; 033-940-461-895-730; 038-487-202-161-432; 039-524-631-746-697; 041-013-862-299-246; 041-864-362-916-311; 045-756-108-073-74X; 048-223-385-236-735; 048-711-037-068-782; 049-540-456-352-692; 052-951-584-268-481; 052-953-850-403-789; 053-137-818-248-134; 054-715-078-148-813; 059-822-271-118-371; 060-397-400-821-890; 060-459-523-160-798; 061-312-895-242-620; 061-659-654-152-299; 062-441-837-157-062; 065-985-181-262-074; 066-302-610-938-45X; 066-761-779-416-465; 068-143-605-669-192; 071-601-864-758-089; 075-426-772-342-06X; 075-526-471-654-826; 077-277-772-557-227; 078-938-204-949-144; 087-814-527-586-749; 088-470-568-990-908; 088-914-677-431-296; 093-484-061-728-036; 101-866-358-809-365; 102-000-964-722-98X; 108-370-770-776-601; 112-682-614-463-686; 120-166-770-024-692; 128-989-457-245-884; 133-226-105-390-194; 154-094-574-732-599; 155-691-175-864-748; 157-135-415-418-575; 158-367-466-672-716; 162-524-610-628-068; 165-756-606-293-842; 168-193-278-954-64X; 168-744-090-896-896; 181-288-411-442-225; 186-655-586-118-519; 191-539-127-334-91X; 194-545-631-692-804; 194-570-919-374-615; 196-882-208-161-504","36","IVÁN A.

IN PARTICULAR, DIRECT EMPIRICAL DATA FOR A RANGE OF INVERTEBRATE TAXA SHOWING HOW FUNCTIONAL GROUPS RESPOND TO PLANT ARCHITECTURE IS LARGELY ABSENT FROM THE LITERATURE.; ; 2. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SWARD ARCHITECTURAL COMPLEXITY IN DETERMINING THE SPECIES RICHNESS OF PREDATORY AND PHYTOPHAGOUS FUNCTIONAL GROUPS OF SPIDERS, BEETLES, AND TRUE BUGS, SAMPLED FROM 135 FIELD MARGIN PLOTS OVER 2 YEARS WAS TESTED. THE PRESENT STUDY COMPARES THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF SWARD ARCHITECTURAL COMPLEXITY TO THAT OF PLANT COMMUNITY ASSEMBLAGE.; ; 3. SWARD ARCHITECTURAL COMPLEXITY WAS FOUND TO BE A DETERMINANT OF SPECIES RICHNESS FOR ALL PHYTOPHAGOUS AND PREDATORY FUNCTIONAL GROUPS. WHEN INDIVIDUAL SPECIES RESPONSES WERE INVESTIGATED, 62.5% OF THE SPIDER AND BEETLE SPECIES, AND 50.0% OF THE TRUE BUGS RESPONDED TO SWARD ARCHITECTURAL COMPLEXITY.; ; 4. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SWARD ARCHITECTURAL COMPLEXITY AND PLANT COMMUNITY ASSEMBLAGE INDICATE THAT THE NUMBER OF INVERTEBRATE SPECIES SUPPORTED BY THE PLANT COMMUNITY ALONE COULD BE INCREASED BY MODIFICATION OF SWARD ARCHITECTURE. MANAGEMENT PRACTICES COULD THEREFORE PLAY A KEY ROLE IN DIVERSIFYING THE ARCHITECTURAL STRUCTURE OF EXISTING FLORAL ASSEMBLAGES FOR THE BENEFIT OF INVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES.; ; 5. THE CONTRASTING EFFECTS OF SWARD ARCHITECTURE ON INVERTEBRATE FUNCTIONAL GROUPS CHARACTERISED BY EITHER DIRECT (PHYTOPHAGOUS SPECIES) OR INDIRECT (PREDATORY SPECIES) DEPENDENCE ON PLANT COMMUNITIES IS DISCUSSED.

MOST OF THE MANAGEMENT REGIMES INVOLVED VARYING THE TIMING AND FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THE FIELD MARGINS WERE CUT. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF CONSISTENT TEMPORAL TRENDS IN THE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF ARANEAE ON EITHER THE EXISTING OR EXPANDED ZONES OF THE FIELD MARGINS DURING THE FIRST FOUR YEARS OF THE EXPERIMENT. HOWEVER, LOWEST NUMBERS WERE RECORDED BEFORE EXPANSION OF THE MARGINS IN 1987, AND HIGHEST NUMBERS IN THE FINAL SAMPLE, IN 1991. ARANEAE REMAINED LESS ABUNDANT, AND LESS SPECIES RICH, ON THE NEWLY EXPANDED THAN ON THE EXISTING ZONES OF THE FIELD MARGINS FOUR YEARS AFTER THEY WERE ' SET-ASIDE'. CUTTING REDUCED BOTH ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS. REGIMES WHICH INCLUDED CUTTING IN MID-SUMMER HAD A GREATER IMPACT WHICH PERSISTED FOR LONGER THAN DID THOSE INVOLVING CUTTING IN SPRING AND AUTUMN. REMOVAL OF CUT MATERIAL WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER SPECIES RICHNESS THAN LEAVING IT IN SITU.

WHETHER LOCAL SPECIES RICHNESS IS DEPENDENT ON LOCAL OR LANDSCAPE FACTORS CAN BE ASSESSED BY EXAMINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE SPECIES RICHNESS. HERE WE STUDIED HOW LOCAL SPECIES RICHNESS IS RELATED TO LANDSCAPE-LEVEL SPECIES RICHNESS IN LANDSCAPES DIFFERING IN AGRICULTURAL INTENSITY. THE RELATIONSHIP WAS LINEAR FOR FIELD BOUNDARIES IN INTENSIVELY CULTIVATED LANDSCAPES AND NON-LINEAR IN LESS-INTENSIVELY CULTIVATED LANDSCAPES. IN LANDSCAPES CONTAINING SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS (ON AVERAGE 4% OF OVERALL LAND-USE), THE RELATIONSHIP WAS NON-LINEAR FOR FIELD BOUNDARIES, BUT LINEAR WHEN CONSIDERING LOCAL SPECIES RICHNESS OF THE GRASSLANDS THEMSELVES. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT LOCAL FACTORS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN LANDSCAPE FACTORS IN DETERMINING LOCAL SPECIES RICHNESS IN LANDSCAPES WHICH CONTAINED SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS. LOCAL SPECIES RICHNESS WAS LIMITED BY LANDSCAPE FACTORS IN INTENSIVELY CULTIVATED LANDSCAPES. THIS INTERPRETATION WAS SUPPORTED BY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOCAL SPECIES RICHNESS AND LANDSCAPE-SCALE AVERAGE MOBILITY AND GENERALIST PERCENTAGE OF BUTTERFLY ASSEMBLAGES. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF FIELD BOUNDARY HABITAT QUALITY FOR BUTTERFLIES IS EXPECTED TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE IN LANDSCAPES WITH SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS, THE SPECIES COMPOSITION OF WHICH IN TURN IS DEPENDENT ON THE REGIONAL OCCURRENCE OF GRASSLANDS.

IMPORTANT SOIL FUNCTIONS LIKE STRUCTURAL MAINTENANCE AND NUTRIENT CYCLING ARE AFFECTED BY EARTHWORMS, THUS IT IS ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTAND HOW ARABLE FARM MANAGEMENT INFLUENCES EARTHWORM SPECIES. ONE AIM OF ARABLE FIELD MARGIN STRIPS AND NON-INVERSION TILLAGE IS TO ENHANCE AGROBIODIVERSITY, HOWEVER THEIR INFLUENCE ON EARTHWORM SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES REMAINS UNCLEAR. IN PARTICULAR, ON-FARM STUDIES CONDUCTED OVER MULTIPLE YEARS THAT CAPTURE VARIABILITY ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE ARE RARE. THE CURRENT STUDY MONITORED EARTHWORM SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES ON 4 FARMS IN HOEKSCHE WAARD, THE NETHERLANDS, FROM 2010 TO 2012. IT WAS HYPOTHESISED THAT ARABLE FIELD MARGIN STRIPS (FM) AND NON-INVERSION TILLAGE (NIT; A REDUCED TILLAGE SYSTEM THAT LOOSENS SUBSOIL AT 30−35 CM DEPTH) WOULD HAVE HIGHER EARTHWORM SPECIES ABUNDANCES (EPIGEICS AND ANECICS IN PARTICULAR), SOIL ORGANIC MATTER, AND SOIL MOISTURE THAN ADJACENT MOULDBOARD PLOUGHING (MP) FIELDS, AND THAT EARTHWORM NUMBERS WOULD DECREASE WITH DISTANCE AWAY FROM FM INTO ARABLE FIELDS (MP ONLY). FM CONTAINED A MEAN TOTAL EARTHWORM ABUNDANCE OF 284 M −2 AND BIOMASS OF 84 G M −2 WHEREAS ADJACENT MP ARABLE FIELDS HAD ONLY 164 EARTHWORMS M −2 AND 31 G M −2 . APORRECTODEA ROSEA , LUMBRICUS RUBELLUS , LUMBRICUS TERRESTRIS , AND LUMBRICUS CASTANEUS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ABUNDANT IN FM THAN ADJACENT ARABLE SOIL UNDER MP. HOWEVER, NO DECREASING TREND WITH DISTANCE FROM FM WAS OBSERVED IN EARTHWORM SPECIES ABUNDANCES. A TILLAGE EXPERIMENT INITIATED ON THE FARMS WITH FM SHOWED THAT RELATIVE TO MP, NIT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED MEAN TOTAL EARTHWORM ABUNDANCE BY 34% TO 275 M −2 AND MEAN TOTAL EARTHWORM BIOMASS BY 15% TO 51 G M −2 OVERALL SAMPLING DATES AND FARMS. L. RUBELLUS , A. ROSEA , AND L. TERRESTRIS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ABUNDANT OVERALL IN NIT THAN MP. FM AND NIT POSITIVELY AFFECTED EARTHWORM SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCES AND IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT THESE EFFECTS COULD BE OBSERVED DESPITE VARIATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND SOIL PROPERTIES BETWEEN SAMPLINGS, FARMS, AND CROPS. HIGHER TOP-SOIL ORGANIC MATTER AND LESS PHYSICAL DISTURBANCE IN FM AND NIT LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER EARTHWORM SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCES. THE ANECIC SPECIES L.

WE EXAMINED THE JOINT EFFECTS OF REFUGE HABITATS AND INSECTICIDE APPLICATION ON CARABID ACTIVITY DENSITY (PARAMETER OF POPULATION DENSITY AND RELATIVE ACTIVITY) AND SPECIES COMPOSITION IN A CORNFIELD. 2. OUR 2-YEAR STUDY COMPRISED FOUR TREATMENTS: (I) ‐REFUGE/‐INSECTICIDE; (II) + REFUGE/ ‐INSECTICIDE; (III) ‐REFUGE/+INSECTICIDE; (IV) + REFUGE/ + INSECTICIDE. REFUGE STRIPS CONSISTED OF GRASSES, LEGUMES AND PERENNIAL FLOWERING PLANTS. ‘‐REFUGE’ STRIPS WERE PLANTED WITH CORN AND NOT TREATED WITH INSECTICIDE. 3. BEFORE PLANTING AND INSECTICIDE APPLICATION, CARABID ACTIVITY DENSITY IN THE CROP AREAS WAS SIMILAR ACROSS ALL TREATMENTS. INSECTICIDE APPLICATION IMMEDIATELY REDUCED CARABID ACTIVITY DENSITY AND ALTERED COMMUNITY COMPOSITION IN THE CROP AREA. 4. REFUGE STRIPS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ACTIVITY DENSITY OF BEETLES THAN ‐REFUGE STRIPS BEFORE PLANTING AND DURING THE SUMMER. 5. DURING SUMMER, AS NEW CARABIDS EMERGED AND INSECTICIDE TOXICITY DECLINED, THE PRESENCE OF REFUGE STRIPS INFLUENCED CARABIDS IN THE ADJACENT CROP AREA. CARABID ACTIVITY DENSITY WITHIN CROP AREAS PREVIOUSLY TREATED WITH INSECTICIDE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER WHEN ADJACENT TO REFUGE STRIPS. ALSO, CARABID COMMUNITIES WITHIN INSECTICIDE-TREATED CROP AREAS WERE AFFECTED BY THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF A REFUGE STRIP. 6. THE PRESENCE OF REFUGE STRIPS DID NOT CONSISTENTLY AUGMENT CARABID NUMBERS IN CROP AREAS WHERE INSECTICIDE WAS NOT APPLIED. ONE EXPLANATION MAY BE THAT INSECTICIDES DECREASED THE QUALITY OF CROP HABITAT TO CARABIDS BY DEPLETION OF PREY AND DIRECT MORTALITY. HOWEVER, SUBSEQUENT REBOUNDS IN PREY DENSITY AND THE ABSENCE OF COMPETING PREDATORS MAY MAKE THESE AREAS RELATIVELY MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN UNPERTURBED CROP HABITATS TO CARABID COLONIZATION FROM REFUGES. 7. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT REFUGES MAY BUFFER THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF INSECTICIDE APPLICATION ON CARABIDS IN ADJACENT FIELDS. DIVERSIFYING AGRO-ECOSYSTEMS WITH REFUGE HABITATS MAY BE A VIABLE STRATEGY FOR MAINTAINING CARABID POPULATIONS IN DISTURBED AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES TO KEEP PESTS BELOW OUTBREAK LEVELS.","38","2","472","483","BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL; INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT; PESTICIDE; HABITAT; PREDATION; ECOLOGY; POPULATION DENSITY; PEST ANALYSIS; AGROECOSYSTEM; AGRONOMY; BIOLOGY","","","","","https://www.jstor.org/stable/2655812 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00602.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00602.x/abstract https://lter.kbs.msu.edu/citations/2640 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00602.x https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00602.x","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1046/J.1365-2664.2001.00602.X","","10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00602.x","2154206394","","0","001-474-276-006-106; 005-028-851-696-576; 006-160-831-631-796; 007-625-495-965-212; 008-608-775-518-291; 009-734-180-719-581; 010-888-549-334-33X; 010-945-646-716-071; 011-789-039-750-846; 013-270-209-241-22X; 014-809-297-009-430; 014-941-860-389-566; 017-142-360-466-615; 019-456-510-284-708; 019-658-253-028-863; 022-070-333-305-083; 026-166-501-144-752; 026-922-796-528-470; 027-873-912-072-078; 030-580-481-786-771; 030-652-847-337-20X; 033-145-570-790-134; 034-985-325-044-398; 037-731-106-378-493; 038-321-854-469-870; 040-815-928-482-982; 041-962-175-932-702; 042-379-932-616-44X; 044-050-646-677-718; 045-924-425-733-406; 047-184-187-145-124; 047-898-549-829-481; 048-240-741-329-183; 051-103-549-479-234; 054-226-689-654-507; 055-083-398-263-398; 055-697-373-449-344; 055-911-047-425-210; 056-587-738-715-983; 056-892-041-411-85X; 056-892-630-404-500; 057-612-922-967-628; 058-743-931-737-265; 060-626-812-234-007; 062-036-445-726-722; 064-893-774-544-494; 067-639-922-939-929; 069-288-842-490-19X; 069-379-822-515-162; 069-622-233-079-646; 072-678-066-297-398; 072-817-046-222-302; 073-892-938-690-183; 078-910-780-389-507; 079-669-821-169-139; 080-139-567-968-521; 082-091-227-062-603; 084-384-881-244-614; 084-387-070-806-39X; 084-572-874-444-640; 085-372-195-731-912; 087-186-786-234-321; 088-399-968-370-207; 089-253-154-997-777; 090-414-638-170-776; 090-754-443-858-977; 097-164-580-285-460; 110-684-291-574-379; 121-270-336-123-002; 122-593-714-312-795; 123-653-571-393-994; 125-647-410-272-819; 132-569-724-005-273; 134-797-888-874-528; 134-829-434-760-01X; 134-921-760-522-115; 137-942-105-992-390; 139-460-793-557-755; 139-909-439-900-001; 140-873-753-237-870; 142-464-875-172-783; 145-653-851-729-665; 149-027-017-028-450; 149-431-649-896-445; 159-198-285-228-060; 166-002-533-461-846; 172-907-036-981-609; 183-952-378-399-880; 184-407-822-732-428; 187-941-892-082-802; 191-535-840-968-047; 194-482-255-430-935","166","JANA C.

ITS WIDESPREAD DECLINE IN WESTERN EUROPE HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION. ATTEMPTS TO RESTORE POPULATIONS HAVE CONCENTRATED UPON HABITAT MANAGEMENT. IN FRANCE, A MOSAIC OF STRIPS PLANTED WITH MAIZE- OR KALE-BASED MIXTURES IS WIDELY USED TO BENEFIT THE GREY PARTRIDGE ON INTENSIVELY CULTIVATED FARMLANDS. THE RATIONALE FOR PLANTING THESE SUMMER-TO-WINTER COVER STRIPS IS TO INCREASE THE OVERWINTER SURVIVAL RATE AND HENCE BREEDING DENSITY. ALTHOUGH THIS POLICY IS COSTLY TO APPLY, THERE IS LITTLE INFORMATION ON ITS EFFECTIVENESS.; ; 2; WE TESTED EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS MANAGEMENT SCHEME AS A PRACTICAL WAY OF IMPROVING OR RESTORING PARTRIDGE POPULATIONS. WE PRESENT DATA FROM A 6-YEAR BEFORE–AFTER CONTROL–IMPACT (BACI) EXPERIMENT REPLICATED ACROSS FOUR STUDY SITES. WE MONITORED PARTRIDGE POPULATIONS TO ESTIMATE BREEDING DENSITY, REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS AND OVERWINTER MORTALITY.; ; 3; DURING THE COURSE OF THE STUDY, NO PARTRIDGE POPULATION INCREASE OCCURRED ON MANAGED AREAS COMPARED WITH CONTROL AREAS. WILDLIFE COVER STRIPS DID NOT IMPROVE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS BUT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER OVERWINTER ‘APPARENT MORTALITY’ RATES.; ; 4; SOME FIELD DATA SUGGESTED THAT THERE WAS A PREDATION RISK AT COVER STRIP–FIELD EDGES. COVER STRIPS MAY CONCENTRATE A NUMBER OF SPECIES WITHIN SMALL ISOLATED AREAS AND MAY ACT, UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, AS AN ECOLOGICAL TRAP FOR PREY SPECIES SUCH AS THE GREY PARTRIDGE. DUE TO THESE COMPLEX AND UNFORESEEN INTERACTIONS, THIS HABITAT MANAGEMENT MEASURE PROVED UNSUITABLE FOR PARTRIDGE RESTORATION.; ; 5; SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. THIS STUDY HAS DEMONSTRATED THE NECESSITY OF FIELD EXPERIMENTS AT A FARM-SCALE TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HABITAT MANAGEMENT SCHEMES. A PRIORI ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON SMALLER SCALE STUDIES, EVEN IF THEY ARE SUPPORTED BY SOME FIELD EVIDENCE, CAN BE MISLEADING BECAUSE THEY FAIL TO CAPTURE THE EMERGENT PROPERTIES OF LARGER SCALE SYSTEMS. THIS STUDY IS A SPECIFIC ILLUSTRATION OF HOW THE BACI APPROACH IS A POWERFUL TOOL FOR ADDRESSING WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS AT LARGE SPATIAL SCALES.","41","5","846","857","REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; WILDLIFE CONSERVATION; WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT; HABITAT; PREDATION; ECOLOGY; ECOLOGICAL TRAP; GEOGRAPHY; GREY PARTRIDGE; WILDLIFE; AGROFORESTRY","","","","","https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00939.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00939.x/full https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00939.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00939.x","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.0021-8901.2004.00939.X","","10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00939.x","1597350551","","0","004-010-787-386-28X; 007-416-181-403-689; 012-499-497-461-372; 016-421-756-148-512; 018-028-975-115-624; 018-655-554-147-217; 021-507-080-163-445; 022-667-644-785-266; 023-935-502-746-047; 024-867-683-320-604; 026-029-480-862-892; 027-185-568-099-888; 033-090-661-724-372; 045-445-063-674-649; 047-000-620-546-182; 053-235-742-998-658; 054-194-261-317-098; 064-837-757-507-919; 068-258-337-754-12X; 068-452-604-669-157; 074-793-529-288-006; 076-919-109-535-676; 078-108-526-839-471; 080-621-909-570-00X; 086-184-504-457-784; 093-835-124-539-323; 094-927-462-200-693; 095-014-169-963-827; 097-657-189-866-102; 100-681-404-630-351; 105-626-400-923-835; 109-564-179-818-191; 111-085-619-662-631; 113-066-359-815-724; 122-307-635-255-948; 130-217-261-489-483; 139-200-896-129-808; 156-066-906-763-397; 158-990-919-499-51X; 159-943-070-825-906; 161-974-661-329-991; 171-875-346-786-761","75","ELISABETH BRO; PIERRE MAYOT; EVE CORDA; FRANÇOIS REITZ","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","","LENS",0,"BRO E, 2004, JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","BRO E, 2004, JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY"

FOR COMPARISON WE ALSO INVESTIGATED THE RESPONSE OF NON-APHIDOPHAGOUS HOVERFLIES. WE EXAMINED THE SPILLOVER FROM TWO TYPES OF FIELD MARGIN (GRASS MARGIN VS. HEDGEROW + GRASS MARGIN) TO ADJACENT MAIZE FIELDS LOCATED IN LANDSCAPES WITH DIFFERENT PROPORTION OF ARABLE LAND. THE SPILLOVER OF NATURAL ENEMIES WAS AFFECTED BY THE FIELD MARGINS, BUT THE RESPONSE VARIED BETWEEN INSECT GROUPS. THE SPILLOVER OF TACHINIDS WAS HIGHER FROM THE GRASS MARGIN THAN FROM HEDGEROWS, SUGGESTING THAT THE SPILLOVER OF THIS GROUP MAY BE RELATED TO THE LOW CONTRAST BETWEEN THE VEGETATION STRUCTURE OF THE MARGIN AND THE CROP. IN CONTRAST TO TACHINIDS, THE ABUNDANCE OF APHIDOPHAGOUS HOVERFLIES WAS HIGHER TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE CROP FIELD, INDEPENDENTLY OF THE TYPE OF FIELD MARGIN. THE SPILLOVER OF NON-APHIDOPHAGOUS HOVERFLIES WAS NOT AFFECTED BY THE TYPE OF FIELD MARGIN. THESE SPECIES WERE ONLY AFFECTED BY THE LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION AS THEIR SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE WERE HIGHER IN LANDSCAPES WITH LOW AMOUNTS OF ARABLE LAND. MEASURES FOCUSING ON THE CREATION AND MANAGEMENT OF FIELD MARGINS NEED TO CONSIDER THE LOCAL CONTRAST BETWEEN FIELD MARGINS AND CROPS IN RELATION TO THE LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS OF DIFFERENT TAXA.","17","1","33","42","BIODIVERSITY; CROP; VEGETATION; ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; TACHINIDAE; SPECIES RICHNESS; AGROFORESTRY; SPILLOVER EFFECT; ARABLE LAND; ABUNDANCE (ECOLOGY)","","","","UNIVERSITY OF PADOVA; EUROPEAN COMMUNITY'S SEVENTH FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179115001061 https://core.ac.uk/display/80155247","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.BAAE.2015.08.005","","10.1016/j.baae.2015.08.005","1161210009","","0","003-978-114-889-219; 004-408-282-086-003; 004-472-145-506-143; 005-574-938-556-945; 006-394-945-371-082; 010-171-254-110-63X; 011-508-246-956-659; 012-432-436-243-64X; 012-539-445-932-252; 012-595-707-248-992; 013-439-054-708-024; 017-708-454-247-712; 017-786-901-727-296; 020-018-619-332-748; 022-321-534-473-933; 022-438-869-235-426; 025-775-649-567-265; 028-851-162-526-112; 029-988-354-588-530; 031-906-714-715-573; 032-361-491-904-324; 037-314-992-178-084; 039-529-237-343-040; 042-303-914-852-499; 043-515-817-797-96X; 044-633-573-761-568; 046-801-703-740-400; 049-091-169-377-597; 049-127-174-557-906; 049-567-584-028-555; 056-789-845-462-569; 060-352-081-906-168; 062-554-425-020-511; 064-939-290-921-514; 076-863-055-982-955; 078-152-796-237-76X; 086-359-248-425-522; 088-426-133-192-335; 092-481-430-798-700; 098-739-512-303-189; 103-348-929-033-891; 105-051-926-097-932; 110-380-064-799-444; 113-365-099-387-283; 114-519-845-592-808; 114-955-369-191-720; 115-483-622-314-813; 115-507-657-132-984; 117-345-687-903-78X; 124-222-927-328-141; 126-322-219-192-539; 127-747-168-852-33X; 132-980-742-169-431; 145-523-815-049-35X; 150-275-342-089-773; 154-024-131-760-095; 159-992-062-101-765; 175-463-126-698-414; 192-923-404-596-807; 195-618-519-387-640","17","DIEGO J.

FIELD MARGIN USE WAS QUANTIFIED AND, BASED ON THE OBSERVED FLIGHT DISTANCES, THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE CURRENT SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT OF FIELD MARGINS IN THE STUDY LANDSCAPE WAS EVALUATED. SKYLARKS PREFERRED FIELD MARGINS FOR FORAGING OVER ALL OTHER HABITAT TYPES RELATIVE TO THEIR SURFACE AREA WITHIN THE TERRITORIES. THE VISITING RATE OF FIELD MARGINS DECREASED WITH INCREASING DISTANCE TO THE NEST, AND ESPECIALLY DROPPED MARKEDLY WHEN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE NEST AND A FIELD MARGIN EXCEEDED 100 M. ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT OF FIELD MARGINS IN THE LANDSCAPE SUGGESTED THAT THE AREA OF SKYLARK BREEDING HABITAT WITHIN 100 M OF A FIELD MARGIN COULD BE INCREASED BY 46%. THIS WAS DUE TO THE PLACEMENT OF FIELD MARGINS ALONGSIDE UNSUITABLE BREEDING HABITAT AND TO THE POSITIONING OF FIELD MARGINS AT SHORT DISTANCES FROM EACH OTHER. THE EFFICIENCY OF AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT FOR SKYLARKS CAN LIKELY BE IMPROVED BY A MORE CAREFUL SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT OF FIELD MARGINS IN THE LANDSCAPE.","170","","10","15","SEASONAL BREEDER; BIODIVERSITY; FIELD (GEOGRAPHY); FORAGING; NEST; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; ALAUDA; FOOD RESOURCES","","","","","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880913000662 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880913000662 http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/439630","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.AGEE.2013.03.001","","10.1016/j.agee.2013.03.001","2006644968","","0","002-900-720-944-007; 003-223-037-571-948; 008-225-619-668-580; 012-267-243-122-028; 014-630-972-063-626; 020-131-452-110-549; 023-847-672-885-998; 026-527-744-858-38X; 027-068-264-288-767; 041-704-628-510-931; 043-009-269-441-396; 049-977-293-677-848; 051-824-580-453-278; 053-787-579-034-941; 056-099-523-856-735; 056-962-675-879-834; 058-089-327-815-315; 058-569-963-310-089; 059-804-606-271-839; 063-993-986-206-755; 064-454-510-982-621; 064-717-657-434-648; 072-009-532-293-469; 073-935-983-022-480; 074-225-773-604-407; 076-278-055-254-459; 095-369-730-713-771; 097-123-929-736-172; 099-921-237-201-045; 103-573-046-017-776; 117-119-858-150-626; 124-079-930-184-362; 124-319-214-482-940; 130-011-136-615-512; 133-858-248-195-498; 145-728-200-767-581; 149-200-651-727-319; 150-275-342-089-773; 150-325-162-873-23X; 165-627-368-251-055; 165-682-376-569-823; 176-962-359-944-180; 179-048-991-295-983","18","M.W.

AT 3 AND 30 M INTO THE CROP FROM THE CONSERVATION STRIP, TOTAL MORTALITY, MORTALITY FROM PREDATORS, PARASITOIDS AND UNSPECIFIED FACTORS WERE MEASURED. TOTAL POLLEN BEETLE LARVAL MORTALITY WAS 66–96%. MORTALITY CAUSED BY PREDATORS WAS 16–27% AND THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MORTALITY AT 3 M AND THAT 30 M FROM THE EXTENSIVELY MANAGED MEADOWS. HOWEVER, IN FIELDS WITH WILD FLOWER STRIPS ADJACENT TO THEM, THE PERCENTAGE MORTALITY FROM PREDATORS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER AT 30 M THAN AT 3 M. THE RANGE OF PARASITISM OF POLLEN BEETLE LARVAE WAS 0–54% AND WAS ON AVERAGE GREATER AT 3 M THAN AT 30 M. IN FIELDS WITH WILD FLOWER STRIPS, THE PERCENTAGE PARASITISM WITH TERSILOCHUS HETEROCERUS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN IN FIELDS WITH EXTENSIVELY MANAGED MEADOWS. HOWEVER, MORTALITY FROM ALL PARASITOIDS WAS ONLY 1–2% AND THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 3 AND 30 M. THE EFFECT OF PARASITOIDS ON POLLEN BEETLE MORTALITY WAS MASKED BY THE HIGH UNSPECIFIED MORTALITY AND THE MORTALITY FROM PREDATORS. THE UNSPECIFIED MORTALITY WAS 46–72% AND WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IN 1998 AND 1999 THAN IN 1996 AND 1997. THESE DIFFERENCES ARE PROBABLY BECAUSE OF METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS (WET IN 1999 AND DRY IN 1998). THE POSSIBLE INFLUENCES OF THE TWO TYPES OF CONSERVATION STRIPS ON POLLEN BEETLE LARVAL DENSITY WERE INVESTIGATED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT IN FIELDS WITH ADJACENT WILD FLOWER STRIPS, THE POLLEN BEETLE LARVAE WERE MORE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED (BUT NOT SIGNIFICANTLY SO) THAN IN FIELDS WITH EXTENSIVELY MANAGED MEADOWS WHERE LARVAL DENSITY DECREASES FASTER FROM THE EDGE INTO THE RAPE FIELD.","90","3","255","263","BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL; LARVA; PREDATION; PEST ANALYSIS; MELIGETHES AENEUS; PARASITISM; PARASITOID; POLLEN BEETLE; BOTANY; AGRONOMY; BIOLOGY","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880901002134","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/S0167-8809(01)00213-4","","10.1016/s0167-8809(01)00213-4","2057987954","","0","015-522-490-223-197; 015-578-334-267-852; 021-199-110-991-742; 032-518-812-117-974; 038-684-107-777-426; 045-486-365-427-994; 047-451-780-735-831; 055-083-398-263-398; 056-892-041-411-85X; 069-379-822-515-162; 069-380-765-701-521; 079-478-547-689-067; 123-653-571-393-994; 132-113-917-163-782; 141-759-936-693-745; 149-431-649-896-445; 151-431-337-222-216; 166-249-452-125-482","58","RUDOLF BÜCHI","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","","LENS",0,"BÜCHI R, 2002, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","BÜCHI R, 2002, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT"

THE HEDGEROW WAS ALSO EFFECTIVE WHEN GOOD AGRONOMIC PRACTICES WERE FOLLOWED, AND THE EFFECT OF DRIFT ON K.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF CONSERVATION PRACTICES ON HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES AND ROOT-ZONE WATER DYNAMICS OF THE SOIL. A 3-YEAR EXPERIMENT WAS PERFORMED ON A SLOPE AT XIANNING. FOUR TREATMENTS WERE EVALUATED FOR THEIR ABILITY TO REDUCE SOIL EROSION AND IMPROVE SOIL WATER CONDITIONS. COMPARED WITH NO PRACTICES (CK) AND LIVING GRASS STRIPS (GS), THE APPLICATION OF POLYACRYLAMIDE (PAM) SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED SOIL CRUST FORMATION DURING INTENSE RAINFALL, WHEREAS RICE STRAW MULCHING (SM) COMPLETELY ABOLISHED SOIL CRUST FORMATION. THE SM AND PAM TREATMENTS IMPROVED SOIL WATER-STABLE AGGREGATES, WITH A REDISTRIBUTION OF MICRO-AGGREGATES INTO MACRO-AGGREGATES. PAM AND SM SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE SOIL WATER-HOLDING CAPACITY. THESE PRACTICES MITIGATED THE DEGRADATION OF THE SOIL SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY (KS) DURING INTENSE RAINFALLS. THESE METHODS INCREASED SOIL WATER STORAGE BUT WITH LIMITED EFFECTS DURING HEAVY RAINFALLS IN THE WET PERIOD. IN CONTRAST, DURING THE DRY PERIOD, SM HAD THE HIGHEST SOIL WATER STORAGE, FOLLOWED BY PAM AND CK. GRASS STRIPS HAD THE LOWEST SOIL WATER STORAGE BECAUSE OF THE WATER UPTAKE DURING THE VIGOROUS GRASS GROWTH. A SLIGHT DECLINE IN THE SOIL MOISTURE RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE UNSATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY (KU) OF THE TOPSOIL. THEREFORE, THE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY IN THE FIELD IS GOVERNED BY SOIL MOISTURE, AND THE REMAINING SOIL MOISTURE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN IMPROVING SOIL PROPERTIES TO RESIST SHORT-TERM DROUGHTS. AS A RESULT, SM IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE WHEN COMPARED WITH PAM AND GS, ALTHOUGH THEY ALL PROTECT THE SOIL HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES DURING WET PERIODS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MULCHING IS THE BEST STRATEGY FOR WATER MANAGEMENT IN EROSION-THREATENED AND DROUGHT-THREATENED RED SOILS.

WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN MANY STUDIES OF THE TRANSPORT OF POLLUTANTS THROUGH GRASS FILTER STRIPS, FEW HAVE ADDRESSED SEDIMENT RELATED PROCESSES THROUGH RESTORED TREE BELTS. IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THESE PROCESSES AND QUANTIFY THEIR RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION TO SEDIMENT TRAPPING, A SERIES OF RAINFALL SIMULATIONS WAS CONDUCTED ON A 600 M2 HILLSLOPE COMPRISING A PASTURE UPSLOPE OF A 15 YEAR OLD TREE BELT. ALTHOUGH THE SIMULATED EVENTS WERE EXTREME (AVERAGE RECURRENCE INTERVALS ∼10 AND 50 YR), THE TRAPPING EFFICIENCY OF THE TREE BELT WAS VERY HIGH: AT LEAST 94% OF THE TOTAL MASS OF SEDIMENTS WAS CAPTURED. ALL THE SIZE FRACTIONS WERE TRAPPED WITH A MINIMUM SEDIMENT TRAPPING RATIO (STR) OF 91% FOR THE MEDIUM-SIZED FRAGMENTS. FRACTIONS 182 ΜM WERE TOTALLY CAPTURED (STR = 100%). THROUGH THE JOINT ANALYSIS OF SEDIMENT BUDGETS AND SOIL SURFACE CONDITIONS, WE IDENTIFIED DIFFERENT TRAPPING PROCESSES. THE MAIN TRAPPING PROCESS IS THE SEDIMENTATION (AT LEAST 62% OF TRAPPED SEDIMENT MASS) WITH DEPOSITS IN THE BACKWATER AND AS MICRO-TERRACES WITHIN THE TREE BELT. MODELLING RESULTS SHOW THAT THE COARSEST SIZE FRACTIONS ABOVE 75 ΜM ARE PREFERENTIALLY DEPOSITED. JOINT INFILTRATION OF WATER AND SEDIMENTS HAS ALSO BEEN NOTICED, HOWEVER, THIS PROCESS ALONE CANNOT EXPLAIN THE SELECTIVE TRAPPING OF THE FINEST FRACTIONS. WE SUGGEST THAT THE FINEST FRACTIONS TRANSPORTED BY THE OVERLAND FLOW MAY BE TRAPPED BY ADSORPTION ON THE ABUNDANT LITTER PRESENT WITHIN THE TREE BELT.

IN THE UNITED STATES AND PARTS OF EUROPE, THIS HAS LED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AGRICULTURAL LAND PRESERVATION PROGRAMS AND RIPARIAN PROTECTION AND REPLANTING EFFORTS ALONG URBAN STREAMS. THE ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF SUCH PROGRAMS FOR THE CONSERVATION OF FRESHWATER BIODIVERSITY HAVE YET TO BE FULLY EXPLORED. WE DESIGNED A STUDY TO INVESTIGATE THE PATTERNS OF STREAM MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE ALONG A GRADIENT OF AGRICULTURE TO URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND THE PATTERNS AMONG URBAN STREAMS THAT VARY IN THE AMOUNT OF INTACT RIPARIAN BUFFER. IN 2001 AND 2002, WE SAMPLED THE 29 SMALL HEADWATER STREAMS COMPRISING THE OUTLYING TRIBUTARIES OF FOUR WATERSHEDS JUST NORTH OF WASHINGTON, D.C., IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY, MARYLAND, USA. THIS REGION HAS HAD DRAMATIC URBAN DEVELOPMENT OVER THE LAST 50 YEARS, YET SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO MAINTAIN RIPARIAN BUFFERS AND PROMOTE PRESERVATION OF AGRICULTURAL LAND. MACROINVERTEBRATE RICHNESS WAS STRONGLY RELATED TO LAND USE, WITH AGRICULTURAL STREAMS EXHIBITING THE HIGHEST MACROINVERTEBRATE DIVERSITY. TAXA RICHNESS WAS RELATED NEGATIVELY AND LINEARLY (NO STATISTICAL THRESHOLD) TO THE AMOUNT OF IMPERVIOUS SURFACE COVER. FOR THE URBAN STREAMS, THERE WAS A STRONG POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INVERTEBRATE DIVERSITY AND RIPARIAN FOREST COVER. URBAN STREAMS WITH HIGH AMOUNTS OF INTACT RIPARIAN FOREST EXHIBITED BIODIVERSITY LEVELS MORE COMPARABLE TO LESS URBAN AREAS DESPITE HIGH AMOUNTS OF IMPERVIOUS COVER IN THEIR CATCHMENTS. THE AGRICULTURAL HEADWATER STREAMS IN THIS STUDY WERE NOT ONLY MORE DIVERSE THAN THE URBAN HEADWATERS, BUT THEIR LEVELS OF MACROINVERTEBRATE DIVERSITY WERE HIGH COMPARED TO OTHER PUBLISHED ESTIMATES FOR AGRICULTURAL STREAMS. THESE HIGHER RICHNESS VALUES MAY BE DUE TO WIDESPREAD USE OF ''BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES'' (BMPS), INCLUDING NO-TILL FARMING AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WOODY AND HERBACEOUS RIPARIAN BUFFERS, WHICH MAY ALLEVIATE MANY ACUTE STRESSORS CAUSED BY CULTIVATION. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT, IF MANAGED PROPERLY, THE PRESERVATION OF AGRICULTURAL LAND FROM DEVELOPMENT MAY HELP CONSERVE STREAM INVERTEBRATE BIODIVERSITY, AND THAT MAINTENANCE OF RIPARIAN FORESTS EVEN IN HIGHLY URBANIZED WATERSHEDS MAY HELP ALLEVIATE ECOLOGICAL DISTURBANCES THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE LIMIT MACROINVERTEBRATE SURVIVAL.","15","4","1169","1177","RIPARIAN ZONE; LAND USE, LAND-USE CHANGE AND FORESTRY; RIPARIAN FOREST; ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; IMPERVIOUS SURFACE; RIPARIAN BUFFER; URBANIZATION; LAND USE; AGRICULTURAL LAND","","","","","https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/04-1484 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/04-1484 https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/04-1484 http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/04-1484 http://rydberg.biology.colostate.edu/bz471/readings/MoorePalmer.pdf https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/04-1484 https://www.jstor.org/stable/info/4543427 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/04-1484/full https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/04-1484 http://palmerlab.umd.edu/Publications/Moore%20and%20Palmer%202005_Ecol%20Apps.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1890/04-1484","","10.1890/04-1484","2052456679","","0","002-239-487-029-857; 006-702-846-072-871; 008-099-347-320-673; 009-550-017-598-234; 009-624-150-525-172; 013-670-874-554-915; 016-407-249-009-242; 019-065-946-135-668; 019-089-565-313-48X; 037-192-364-418-275; 037-784-019-629-927; 042-936-884-620-039; 046-626-408-470-449; 047-924-585-963-094; 055-475-878-207-54X; 057-191-112-701-980; 059-726-124-598-491; 061-647-605-955-134; 064-155-340-699-777; 065-524-766-334-22X; 077-806-418-364-116; 077-853-550-551-113; 078-241-800-893-458; 082-716-873-973-679; 084-737-607-904-270; 092-778-984-444-098; 093-051-584-612-100; 096-769-301-440-794; 098-004-631-148-428; 111-407-646-226-631; 115-304-531-279-534; 117-343-019-994-955; 120-212-843-531-658; 155-134-656-519-45X; 158-695-500-320-945; 176-559-157-173-808; 178-020-666-486-363; 183-461-881-469-552; 192-561-281-096-267","262","AARON A.

THESE ORGANISMS CAN DISPERSE BETWEEN NON-CROP HABITATS AND CROPS AND CAN BENEFIT FROM RESOURCES IN NON-CROP AREAS. THUS, IT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO CONSERVE NON-CROP HABITATS TO MAINTAIN ECOSYSTEM SERVICES WITHIN CROPS. HOWEVER, EVEN SINGLE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, SUCH AS POLLINATION OR PREDATION OF PESTS, MAY BE PROVIDED BY A COMPLEX OF SPECIES. DIFFERENT SPECIES MAY RESPOND TO LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AT DIFFERING SPATIAL SCALES. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION: WHAT SCALES SHOULD CONSERVATION TAKE PLACE AT TO SUSTAIN AN ECOSYSTEM SERVICE? HERE, WE EXAMINE VARIATION IN PREDATION OF TWO POTATO PESTS IN RESPONSE TO LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE. SPECIFICALLY, PREDATION OF COLORADO POTATO BEETLE, LEPTINOTARSA DECEMLINEATA, AND GREEN PEACH APHID, MYZUS PERSICAE, WERE QUANTIFIED IN POTATO AND FIELD-MARGIN HABITATS SET IN LANDSCAPES THAT VARIED AT DIFFERENT SCALES. AT A LOCAL SCALE (METERS), POTATO FIELDS OF DIFFERENT SIZES WERE BORDERED BY DIFFERENT AREAS OF GRASSY FIELD MARGIN. AT A BROAD SCALE (KILOMETERS), THESE HABITATS WERE SET IN LANDSCAPES COMPOSED OF VARYING PERCENTAGES OF NON-CROP HABITAT. PREDATION OF BOTH PESTS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE, BUT THIS RELATIONSHIP OCCURRED AT DIFFERENT SCALES FOR EACH PEST AND INTERACTED DIFFERENTLY WITH HABITAT TYPE. PREDATION OF L. DECEMLINEATA EGGS WAS GREATER IN FIELD MARGINS THAN IN THE POTATO CROP AND INCREASED IN BOTH HABITATS WHEN FIELD MARGINS WERE LARGE RELATIVE TO POTATOES. IN CONTRAST, APHID PREDATION IN FIELD MARGINS INCREASED WITH THE AREA OF NON-CROP HABITAT WITHIN 1.5 KM, BUT DID NOT CHANGE IN ADJACENT POTATO. THESE DATA EMPHASIZE THAT, EVEN A SINGLE ECOSYSTEM SERVICE, SUCH AS PREDATION OF PESTS, CAN BE INFLUENCED BY LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AT MULTIPLE SCALES. MORE GENERALLY, IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO CONSERVE HETEROGENEITY BOTH AT LOCAL SCALES (INDIVIDUAL FARM FIELDS) AND BROAD SCALES (ENTIRE MOSAIC LANDSCAPES) TO MAINTAIN ECOSYSTEM SERVICES.

FOR CONSERVATION PLANNING THE KNOWLEDGE OF OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS AND ITS SEASONAL VARIATION IS HIGHLY RELEVANT. OUR OBJECTIVES WERE TO (I) EVALUATE THE SEASONAL VARIATION IN RUNOFF REDUCTION AND SEDIMENT TRAPPING IN A GWW, (II) IDENTIFY THE DRIVING PARAMETERS AND (III) MEASURE AND ANALYSE THE SEASONAL VARIATION OF EACH OF THESE PARAMETERS. RUNOFF AND SEDIMENT DELIVERY WERE MEASURED BETWEEN 1994 AND 2001 IN TWO PAIRED SUBWATERSHEDS, BOTH OPTIMISED TO REDUCE RUNOFF AND SEDIMENT DELIVERY BY AN INTENSIVE SOIL CONSERVATION SYSTEM WITHIN THE FIELDS. IN ONE OF THE SUBWATERSHEDS ADDITIONALLY A GWW (290 M LONG, 37 M WIDE) WAS ESTABLISHED TO FURTHER IMPROVE SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION. DURING THE OBSERVATION PERIOD IT REDUCED RUNOFF AND SEDIMENT DELIVERY BY 87 AND 93%, RESPECTIVELY. 70% OF TOTAL OUTFLOW AND 68% OF TOTAL SEDIMENT OUTPUT OCCURRED BETWEEN FEBRUARY AND APRIL, MAINLY CONTROLLED BY WATERSHED HYDROLOGY. SEASONAL CHANGES IN GWW PROPERTIES, NAMELY SOIL WATER CONTENT AND HYDRAULIC ROUGHNESS, HAD A MINOR EFFECT.

IN THIS STUDY WE CARRIED OUT A SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECTS OF HABITAT TYPE AND AGE ON THE QUALITY OF OVERWINTERING REFUGES FOR COLEOPTERA AND ARANEAE ON AN ARABLE FARM IN THE UK. HEDGEROW HABITATS CONTAINED TALLER AND MORE DIVERSE VEGETATION WITH A GREATER PROPORTION OF BARE GROUND COMPARED WITH FIELD MARGINS. VEGETATION HEIGHT AND DIVERSITY, AND THE RICHNESS AND COVER OF FORBS ALL INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH HABITAT AGE. SOIL ORGANIC MATTER CONTENT ALSO INCREASED WITH HABITAT AGE, SUGGESTING A MORE FAVOURABLE STRUCTURE FOR BURROWING COLEOPTERA. TOTAL ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS OF COLEOPTERA AND ARANEAE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN HEDGEROW HABITATS COMPARED WITH THE FIELD MARGINS. THIS LARGELY REFLECTED THE RESPONSE OF STAPHYLINID BEETLES, THE MOST ABUNDANT GROUP RECORDED. THERE WAS NO EFFECT OF HABITAT AGE ON OVERALL ABUNDANCE OR DIVERSITY, SUGGESTING THE GOOD DISPERSAL ABILITY OF MANY FARMLAND INVERTEBRATES, BUT ALSO REFLECTING THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HABITAT AGE AND TYPE. THE RESPONSE OF INDIVIDUAL INVERTEBRATE SPECIES WAS MORE MIXED: 10 SPECIES WERE RECORDED IN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DENSITIES IN THE HEDGE BASE COMPARED WITH ONE IN THE FIELD MARGIN. SIMILARLY, EIGHT SPECIES WERE RECORDED IN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DENSITIES IN MATURE HABITATS COMPARED WITH FOUR IN RECENTLY ESTABLISHED VEGETATION. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN HABITAT TYPE AND AGE FOR SIX SPECIES, OF WHICH FOUR SHOWED A MARKED PREFERENCE FOR THE BASE OF MATURE HEDGEROWS. THESE INCLUDED BOTH IMPORTANT PREDATORS OF CEREAL APHIDS AND CROP PESTS. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT HEDGEROWS PROVIDED THE HIGHEST QUALITY OVERWINTERING HABITAT FOR INVERTEBRATES EMPHASISING THE IMPORTANCE OF STRATEGIES DIRECTED AT CONSERVING AND ENHANCING THIS HABITAT.

UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI--COLUMBIA 2011.""DECEMBER 2011""UNDERSTANDING SORPTION AND TRANSPORT OF VETERINARY ANTIBIOTICS (VAS) IS IMPORTANT FOR ASSESSING THE RISK OF VAS REACHING WATER RESOURCES. VEGETATIVE BUFFER STRIPS (VBS) MAY BE A USEFUL TOOL FOR MITIGATING VETERINARY ANTIBIOTIC TRANSPORT FROM AGRICULTURAL LANDS. SORPTION EXPERIMENT RESULTS SHOWED THAT OXYTETRACYCLINE (OTC) WAS STRONGLY ADSORBED AND NOT READILY EXTRACTABLE, WHILE SULFADIMETHOXINE (SDT) AND SULFAMETHAZINE (SMZ) WERE HIGHLY MOBILE IN SOIL. FOR ALL THE ANTIBIOTICS STUDIED, VBS SOILS HAD HIGHER SORPTION CAPACITY THAN CROPLAND SOILS. LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSES INDICATE THAT CLAY CONTENT AND PH WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT SOIL PROPERTIES CONTROLLING OTC AND SDT ADSORPTION, RESPECTIVELY. FOR SMZ, ORGANIC CARBON CONTENT, PH, INITIAL SMZ CONCENTRATION, AND CLAY CONTENT WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS CONTROLLING SORPTION. DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER HAD A SLIGHT NEGATIVE EFFECT ON SMZ SORPTION. TRANSPORT EXPERIMENTS OF SMZ WERE CONDUCTED IN GLASS COLUMNS REPACKED WITH AGROFORESTRY AND CROPLAND SOILS. COMPUTER MODELING USING HYDRUS-1D SOFTWARE INDICATED THAT A THREE-SITE MODEL CONTAINING TWO REVERSIBLE SITES AND ONE IRREVERSIBLE SITE COUPLED WITH THE FREUNDLICH SORPTION COMPONENT BEST DESCRIBES SMZ TRANSPORT THROUGH THE COLUMNS. DATA FROM EQUILIBRIUM SORPTION EXPERIMENTS AND COLUMN TRANSPORT EXPERIMENTS SUGGEST THAT THE AGF SOIL HAS A LARGER CAPACITY TO RETAIN SMZ THAN THE CROPLAND SOIL. OVERALL, THIS RESEARCH FACILITATES OUR UNDERSTANDING OF VA SORPTION AND TRANSPORT IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND SUPPORTS THE USE OF VEGETATIVE BUFFERS TO MITIGATE VA LOSS FROM AGROECOSYSTEMS.INCLUDES BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCE","","","","","BUFFER (OPTICAL FIBER); SOIL WATER; SOIL COMPOSITION; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; AGROFORESTRY; AGROECOSYSTEM; SORPTION","","","","","https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/handle/10355/14493","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.32469/10355/14493","","10.32469/10355/14493","2525173569","","0","057-714-072-954-341; 120-461-617-171-612","3","BEI CHU","UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI LIBRARIES","UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI LIBRARIES","","LENS",0,"CHU B, NA, UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI LIBRARIES","CHU B, NA, UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI LIBRARIES"

VEGETATED BUFFER ZONES ADJACENT TO A STREAM CAN EFFECTIVELY REMOVE AND RETAIN NUTRIENTS AND SEDIMENTS. IT IS, THEREFORE, IMPORTANT TO STUDY DESIGN CRITERIA WHICH OPTIMISE THE EFFECT OF BUFFER ZONES (BZ). THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE INFLUENCE OF FOUR CRITERIA: (I) BUFFER ZONE WIDTH, (II) AMOUNT OF SURFACE RUNOFF WATER ENTERING THE BZ, (III) SEASONAL VARIATION AND (IV) VEGETATION TYPE. THESE PARAMETERS WERE STUDIED AFTER SIMULATED AND NATURAL RUNOFF AT FOUR DIFFERENT SITES IN SOUTHERN NORWAY WITH COLD TEMPERATE CLIMATE. SURFACE RUNOFF WAS COLLECTED BEFORE ENTERING AND AFTER PASSING THE BZS. THE SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS WERE SHORT-TERM EXPERIMENTS CARRIED OUT OVER A FEW DAYS IN 1992 AND 1993. IN THE NATURAL RUNOFF EXPERIMENTS, VOLUME PROPORTIONAL MIXED SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED AFTER EACH RUNOFF PERIOD DURING 1992–1999. THE RESULTS SHOW SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REMOVAL EFFICIENCY (IN %) FROM 10 M WIDE BZS COMPARED TO 5 M WIDTHS, HOWEVER, THE SPECIFIC RETENTION (PER M 2 ) IS HIGHER IN 5 M BZ. BUFFER ZONES CAN RECEIVE PARTICLE RUNOFF OVER SEVERAL DAYS WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THEIR REMOVAL LEVEL. RETENTION EFFICIENCY BETWEEN SUMMER AND AUTUMN VARIED DEPENDING ON THE MEASURED PARAMETER (PHOSPHORUS, PARTICLES AND NITROGEN), AND THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN REMOVAL EFFICIENCY BETWEEN SUMMER AND WINTER.

PRIMARY AIMS ARE TO DEVELOP UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESSES GOVERNING FLOOD GENERATION AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACTS OF LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, AND TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN PROCESS UNDERSTANDING AND ABILITY TO PREDICT EFFECTS ON DOWNSTREAM FLOODING. TO ACHIEVE THIS, THE EXPERIMENT IS DESIGNED TO OPERATE AT PLOT (100 M2), HILLSLOPE (0·1 KM2) AND SMALL CATCHMENT SCALE (10 KM2). HILLSLOPE-SCALE DATA, FROM AN UNDER-DRAINED, AGRICULTURALLY IMPROVED PASTURE, SHOW THAT DRAIN FLOW IS A DOMINANT RUNOFF PROCESS. HOWEVER, DEPENDING ON ANTECEDENT MOISTURE CONDITIONS, OVERLAND FLOW MAY EXCEED DRAIN FLOW RATES AND CAN BE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO PEAK FLOW RUNOFF AT THE HILLSLOPE-SCALE. FLOW, SOIL TENSION DATA AND TRACER TESTS CONFIRM THE IMPORTANCE OF MACROPORES AND PRESENCE OF PERCHED WATER TABLES UNDER NORMAL WET CONDITIONS. COMPARISONS OF PASTURE RUNOFF WITH THAT FROM WITHIN A 10 YEAR-OLD TREE SHELTERBELT SHOW SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OVERLAND FLOW DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF TREES AND/OR ABSENCE OF SHEEP.

WE ALSO MEASURED VEGETATION COVER WITHIN EACH BORDER TREATMENT FROM JUNE TO AUGUST 2009. WE CAPTURED 491 INDIVIDUALS OF TWO SPECIES, THE HISPID COTTON RAT (SIGMODON HISPIDUS) AND HOUSE MOUSE (MUS MUSCULUS). COTTON RAT ABUNDANCE WAS ≥2 TIMES GREATER IN GRASS AND FLOWER BORDERS AND FLOWERS-ONLY BORDERS THAN IN FALLOW BORDERS, LIKELY BECAUSE OF GREATER VEGETATION DENSITY AND AVAILABILITY OF PREFERRED FOODS IN PLANTED BORDERS. NO COTTON RATS WERE CAPTURED IN MOWED BORDERS, AND HOUSE MOUSE ABUNDANCE WAS ≥5 TIMES LOWER IN MOWED BORDERS THAN IN OTHER BORDER TYPES.

THE BARRIER WAS COMPRISED OF A PLANTING OF THREE ROWS OF HYBRID POPLAR, POPULUS DELTOIDES BARTR.×POPULUS NIGRA L., ONE ROW OF ITALIAN ALDER, ALNUS CORDATA L. (NECTAR REWARD), AND ONE ROW OF WHITE PINE, PINUS STROBUS L. THE HEDGEROW COMPLETELY SURROUNDED THE PERIMETER OF THE APPLE ORCHARD AND WAS TREATED WITH GARLIC AND A LOW RATE OF PYRETHROID INSECTICIDE IN 4 OF THE 5 YEARS. THE ENHANCED IPM PROGRAM SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED G. MOLESTA POPULATIONS AS MEASURED BY MOTH CAPTURES IN PHEROMONE TRAPS. CAPTURES OF G.

TO EXPLAIN THESE DIFFERENCES IN G. MOLESTA CONTROL, AND THE POTENTIAL NON-LETHAL EFFECT OF HEDGEROW BARRIERS ON G.

IN THE OVERWINTERING GENERATION AT A HEIGHT OF 0.95 AND 1.95 M, THE MEAN NUMBER OF MOTHS CAPTURED PER SAMPLING PERIOD WAS 14.64 AND 14.84, RESPECTIVELY, AND ONLY 2.95 AT 3.20 M. HOWEVER, THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS CAPTURED IN THE SECOND AND THIRD GENERATIONS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AT THE THREE DIFFERENT HEIGHTS. FRUIT DAMAGE EVALUATED BEFORE ‘JUNE DROP’ CLOSELY CORRESPONDED TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF MOTHS CAPTURED DURING THE OVERWINTERING GENERATION. FRUIT DAMAGE AT A HEIGHT OF 1.95 AND 3.20 M WAS 5.8 AND 3.5%, RESPECTIVELY. THESE RESULTS INDICATED THAT G.

HERE, WE EVALUATE THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, HISTORY OF MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WITHIN HEDGEROWS, AND ADJACENT LAND-USE ON HERB AND SHRUB SPECIES DISTRIBUTION IN WOODY HEDGEROWS OF AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES OF SOUTHERN QUEBEC, CANADA. WE PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF FOREST HERBS AND WEED SPECIES AND IDENTIFY THE MAIN FACTORS THAT EXPLAIN THEIR PRESENCE. WE ALSO EVALUATE THE AMOUNT OF SPATIAL STRUCTURING IN THE SPECIES DATA AND EXPLANATORY VARIABLES. OUR RESULTS SHOW SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SPECIES COMPOSITION RELATED TO THE UNIQUE INFLUENCE OF ALL SETS OF FACTORS CONSIDERED. ADJACENT LAND-USE (FROM INTENSIVE CROP TO FALLOW LAND) REMAINS THE BEST PREDICTOR OF OVERALL SPECIES DISTRIBUTION, FOLLOWED BY ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND HISTORY OF MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. THE PROBABILITY OF FINDING FOREST HERBS IN HEDGEROWS INCREASES AS INTENSITY OF ADJACENT AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES (FROM INTENSIVE CROP TO FALLOW LAND) DECREASES. POTENTIAL WEED SPECIES, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE FOUND WITHIN NARROW HEDGEROWS ADJACENT TO THE MORE INTENSIVELY MANAGED FIELDS. WE DISCUSS THE RESULTS IN TERMS OF THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT DETERMINANTS OF PLANT DIVERSITY IN HEDGEROWS AND DEMONSTRATE THE NECESSITY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN MULTIPLE STRUCTURING FACTORS TO DEVISE PROPER CONSERVATION STRATEGIES. SUCH STRATEGIES WILL HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE ECOLOGICAL AS WELL AS THE AGRICULTURAL EXPLOITATION CONTEXT IN WHICH LINEAR FEATURES ARE FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE.","105","3","355","367","SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; WEED; VEGETATION TYPE; CONTEXT (LANGUAGE USE); LAND USE; HABITAT CONSERVATION; LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","","","","","https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20023110510 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20023110510.html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320701002191","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/S0006-3207(01)00219-1","","10.1016/s0006-3207(01)00219-1","2007830211","","0","002-481-178-498-479; 004-807-568-531-692; 007-243-303-723-240; 007-361-282-044-640; 022-648-804-684-488; 025-094-907-006-599; 027-519-609-839-131; 028-917-029-117-685; 029-386-831-957-40X; 030-861-033-911-111; 031-532-300-342-70X; 032-961-767-789-531; 035-857-688-042-308; 037-610-129-120-822; 038-629-353-825-41X; 041-589-824-696-381; 047-148-330-480-577; 047-949-455-932-004; 051-197-969-663-775; 051-541-813-281-746; 055-359-412-300-445; 062-036-445-726-722; 063-003-550-683-547; 064-724-577-954-665; 068-143-605-669-192; 069-222-611-667-46X; 073-387-419-745-798; 073-798-803-161-275; 079-913-994-832-084; 080-615-210-297-301; 089-627-402-193-481; 091-707-812-404-482; 096-074-282-606-638; 100-152-690-804-696; 102-275-999-383-853; 124-372-782-901-413; 136-330-704-990-297; 144-368-131-037-143; 155-555-776-794-70X; 156-624-196-949-616; 157-623-975-380-782; 165-123-901-414-731; 174-103-363-317-763; 187-050-769-304-212; 195-369-716-717-018","71","SYLVIE DE BLOIS; GÉRALD DOMON; ANDRÉ BOUCHARD","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","","LENS",0,"BLOIS S, 2002, BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","BLOIS S, 2002, BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION"

HOWEVER, PLANT DIVERSITY IN FIELD BOUNDARIES HAS DECREASED SUBSTANTIALLY IN RECENT DECADES. THIS PATTERN IS GENERALLY LINKED WITH THE INTENSIFICATION OF AGRICULTURAL LAND USE AT FIELD AND LANDSCAPE LEVEL. THEREFORE, WE AIMED TO TEST THE EFFECT OF FARMING MANAGEMENT (FIELD AND BOUNDARY MANAGEMENT), BOUNDARY STRUCTURE (WIDTH AND HABITAT ASSEMBLAGE CONSIDERING THE MEDITERRANEAN GRASSLAND ELEMENT), AND LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY ON PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS OF FIELD BOUNDARIES. PLANTS WERE RECORDED ALONG 30 FIELD BOUNDARIES NEXT TO ORGANIC FIELDS AND 30 NEXT TO CONVENTIONAL FIELDS LOCATED IN 15 AGRARIAN LOCALITIES OF NE IBERIAN PENINSULA ALONG A GRADIENT OF LANDSCAPE COMPLEXITY.

THE MANAGEMENT OF SCHEME OPTIONS CAN INFLUENCE THEIR VALUE FOR DELIVERING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES BY MODIFYING THE COMPOSITION OF FLORAL AND FAUNAL COMMUNITIES. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF AN AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEME PRESCRIPTION ON ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING BY TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT INFLUENCES DECOMPOSITION RATES IN GRASSY ARABLE FIELD MARGINS. THE EFFECTS OF TWO VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN ARABLE FIELD MARGINS – CUTTING AND SOIL DISTURBANCE (SCARIFICATION) – ON LITTER DECOMPOSITION WERE COMPARED USING A LITTERBAG EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH IN EARLY APRIL 2006. BAGS HAD EITHER SMALL MESH DESIGNED TO RESTRICT ACCESS TO SOIL MACROFAUNA, OR LARGE MESH THAT WOULD ALLOW MACROFAUNA TO ENTER. BAGS WERE POSITIONED ON THE SOIL SURFACE OR INSERTED INTO THE SOIL IN CUT AND SCARIFIED MARGINS, RETRIEVED AFTER 44, 103 AND 250 DAYS AND THE AMOUNT OF LITTER MASS REMAINING WAS CALCULATED. LITTER LOSS FROM THE LITTERBAGS WITH LARGE MESH WAS GREATER THAN FROM THE SMALL MESH BAGS, PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT SOIL MACROFAUNA ACCELERATE RATES OF LITTER DECOMPOSITION. IN THE LARGE MESH BAGS, THE PROPORTION OF LITTER REMAINING IN BAGS ABOVE AND BELOWGROUND IN THE CUT PLOTS WAS SIMILAR, WHILE IN THE SCARIFIED PLOTS, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LITTER LEFT IN THE ABOVEGROUND BAGS THAN IN THE BELOWGROUND BAGS. THIS LOSS OF BALANCE BETWEEN DECOMPOSITION RATES ABOVE AND BELOWGROUND IN SCARIFIED MARGINS MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF GRASSY ARABLE FIELD MARGINS BY INFLUENCING NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY FOR PLANT COMMUNITIES.","41","1","90","97","ECOSYSTEM; TILLAGE; VEGETATION; LITTER; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; PLANT COMMUNITY; SOIL BIOLOGY; AGROFORESTRY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; AGRONOMY; ARABLE LAND","","","","","http://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND44141355 https://core.ac.uk/display/347104 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/744106 http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/9186/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139308001613","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.APSOIL.2008.09.003","","10.1016/j.apsoil.2008.09.003","1971816230","","0","001-575-548-525-27X; 003-460-280-575-85X; 006-848-972-549-61X; 007-847-412-148-043; 010-472-819-956-683; 015-725-664-867-946; 020-564-612-156-583; 022-526-631-372-455; 024-716-859-528-663; 025-307-718-158-485; 030-453-266-652-445; 036-818-291-335-617; 042-303-914-852-499; 045-678-307-793-220; 046-093-341-056-083; 050-364-885-261-831; 054-937-102-797-519; 058-513-758-659-975; 059-659-598-431-039; 064-142-249-606-389; 069-688-387-812-670; 071-173-838-672-398; 075-513-114-392-773; 077-911-524-409-482; 094-442-752-754-939; 098-719-657-126-04X; 107-465-507-701-19X; 116-759-930-330-613; 117-992-826-323-082; 118-807-690-083-030; 122-528-143-728-138; 125-786-651-769-041; 128-760-888-268-265; 135-233-059-071-616; 136-229-404-898-732; 145-653-851-729-665; 158-498-105-839-226; 171-868-007-830-355; 186-405-649-407-27X; 188-361-607-873-337","9","JO SMITH; SIMON G.

DESPITE THEIR WIDE USE, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF ESTABLISHING SHELTERBELTS ON SOIL MACRO INVERTEBRATES, ESPECIALLY EARTHWORMS, WHICH ARE OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE IN SOIL PROCESSES. WE ASSESSED EARTHWORM COMPOSITION, DIVERSITY AND BIOMASS IN THREE LAND USE SYSTEMS: NATIVE SHELTERBELTS DOMINATED BY ACACIA AND EUCALYPTUS SPECIES, AGRICULTURAL PASTURES AND NATIVE REMNANT WOODLAND FRAGMENTS DOMINATED BY EUCALYPTUS BLAKELYI AND/OR EUCALYPTUS MELLIODORA . EARTHWORM COMMUNITIES DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG SYSTEMS, WITH ABUNDANCE, BIOMASS AND DIVERSITY GREATEST UNDER PASTURE. WITHIN SHELTERBELTS WE SAW A SHIFT FROM HIGH EARTHWORM BIOMASS AND DENSITY TO LOW WITH INCREASING TIME AFTER ESTABLISHMENT.

MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT ARTHROPODS ARE INFLUENCED BY LANDSCAPE CONTEXT. THEREFORE, FOR SUCCESSFUL WIREWORM RISK ASSESSMENT, IT IS IMPORTANT TO GAIN MORE INFORMATION ON RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AND WIREWORM INFESTATION LEVEL. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE IF DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE VARIABLES ARE RELATED TO WIREWORM INFESTATION, REPRESENTED BY THE PROPORTION OF WIREWORM DAMAGED POTATO TUBERS. BASED ON AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS AND FIELD SURVEYS LANDSCAPE VARIABLES, SUCH AS LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION, LANDSCAPE COMPLEXITY AND ECOLOGICAL VARIABLES WERE CHARACTERISED AROUND 14 RANDOMLY SELECTED POTATO FIELD PLOTS ALONGSIDE THE GRADIENT FROM THE LOWER WARM-DRY “WEINVIERTEL” (REGION 1) TO THE COOL-HUMID “WALDVIERTEL” (REGION 2) IN THE NORTH-EAST OF AUSTRIA AT THREE SCALES (1, 9 AND 25 HA). RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LANDSCAPE VARIABLES AND WIREWORM DAMAGE RATINGS WERE DESCRIBED BY SPEARMAN CORRELATIONS COEFFICIENTS. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT WIREWORM DAMAGE WAS HIGHER IN REGION 2 THAN IN REGION 1 AND TENDED TO BE HIGHER IN SOILS WITH HIGHER SAND CONTENT. AMONG THE TESTED LANDSCAPE VARIABLES ONLY LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION, ESPECIALLY GRASSY FIELD MARGINS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH WIREWORM DAMAGE AT THE 25 HA SCALE. IN AREAS WITH HIGH PROPORTION OF SUCH GRASSY HABITATS, FARMERS SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION TO FIELD CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS SAND CONTENT IN SOIL, AND MANAGEMENT, LIKE CROP ROTATION.

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ESTIMATE THE DISPERSAL SUCCESS OF FOREST-DWELLING PLANTS FROM A STAND INTO AND ALONG AN ATTACHED WOODY CORRIDOR, AND TO EXPLAIN THE OBSERVED PATTERNS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF SPECIES’ DISPERSAL TRAITS AND CORRIDOR PROPERTIES. WE SAMPLED 47 FOREST–CORRIDOR TRANSECTS IN THE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES OF SOUTHEASTERN ESTONIA. REGIONALLY COMMON FOREST-DWELLING SPECIES (OBSERVED IN AT LEAST 10 % OF SEED-SOURCE FORESTS) WERE CLASSIFIED ON THE BASIS OF THEIR ECOLOGICAL RESPONSE PROFILE—FOREST-RESTRICTED SPECIES (F-TYPE) AND FOREST-DWELLING GENERALISTS (G-TYPE). SPECIES RICHNESS AND THE PROPORTION OF F-TYPE SPECIES DECREASED SHARPLY FROM THE SEED-SOURCE FOREST CORE TO THE FOREST EDGE AND TO THE FIRST 10–15 M OF THE CORRIDOR, WHILE G-TYPE SPECIES RICHNESS REMAINED CONSTANT THROUGHOUT THE TRANSECT. CORRIDOR STRUCTURE HAD A SPECIES-SPECIFIC EFFECT—F SPECIES WERE PROMOTED BY OLD (≥50 YEARS) AND WIDE (≥10 M) CORRIDORS, WHILE G SPECIES WERE SUPPORTED BY YOUNG AND NARROW CORRIDORS WITH DITCH-RELATED SOIL DISTURBANCES. MODERATE SHADE (CANOPY COVER <75 %) WAS OPTIMAL FOR ALL FOREST-DWELLING SPECIES. LARGE DISPERSULE WEIGHT, AND NOT SEED WEIGHT, DISPERSAL VECTOR OR ELLENBERG’S INDICATOR VALUES, WAS THE TRAIT THAT DIFFERENTIATED F SPECIES FROM G SPECIES. WE CONCLUDE THAT MOST WOODY CORRIDORS ARE ONLY DISPERSAL STEPPING-STONE HABITATS FOR HABITAT GENERALIST SPECIES, AND NOT FOR SPECIALISTS. ONLY CENTURY OLD CORRIDORS CAN RELIEVE THE DISPERSAL LIMITATION OF FOREST-RESTRICTED SPECIES.","214","3","455","470","SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; SEED DISPERSAL; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; WILDLIFE CORRIDOR; DISPERSAL VECTOR; GENERALIST AND SPECIALIST SPECIES; BIOLOGICAL DISPERSAL; SPECIES RICHNESS; BIOLOGY","","","","","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11258-013-0182-1 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11258-013-0182-1.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1007/S11258-013-0182-1","","10.1007/s11258-013-0182-1","2001084569","","0","000-028-962-557-075; 000-575-209-961-337; 002-569-195-367-776; 007-221-361-423-978; 007-842-072-048-27X; 007-942-930-508-462; 014-161-096-853-425; 017-943-669-463-869; 018-023-127-841-209; 018-463-393-074-304; 018-780-961-972-719; 019-620-620-455-821; 020-938-492-722-870; 021-907-377-633-412; 022-848-213-712-156; 030-185-440-082-022; 035-051-512-271-972; 036-722-726-289-60X; 038-161-345-680-90X; 038-361-105-216-688; 039-524-631-746-697; 041-469-176-773-812; 042-530-992-835-782; 044-847-682-877-803; 046-559-721-405-224; 047-288-579-303-247; 051-197-969-663-775; 051-693-696-025-120; 056-853-001-254-085; 063-207-503-700-767; 068-143-605-669-192; 068-251-487-388-581; 071-601-864-758-089; 073-170-131-117-322; 075-235-467-560-472; 076-208-799-863-720; 092-338-002-097-519; 092-697-296-797-661; 100-283-244-414-903; 108-586-996-670-001; 109-162-269-116-845; 114-338-851-242-14X; 141-005-140-982-524; 149-223-438-699-672; 149-673-684-724-149; 156-624-196-949-616; 168-592-107-353-063; 172-560-580-560-47X; 176-543-809-298-678","22","JAAN LIIRA; TAAVI PAAL","PLANT ECOLOGY","PLANT ECOLOGY","","LENS",0,"LIIRA J, 2013, PLANT ECOLOGY","LIIRA J, 2013, PLANT ECOLOGY"

TWO OF THE SHELTERBELTS IN QUESTION WERE OF THE SINGLE-ROW TYPE. THE REMAINING TWO CONSISTED OF AT LEAST TWO ROWS OF DECIDUOUS TREES AND IN BOTH CASES SOME CONIFERS. WIND MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE UNDER VARIOUS WEATHER CONDITIONS, BOTH IN WINTER AND IN SUMMER. THE MINIMUM RELATIVE WIND SPEED ON THE LEE SIDE VARIED FROM CA 0.1 BEHIND THE MOST DENSE SHELTERBELT TO 0.4 BEHIND THE MOST POROUS ONE WHEN THE WIND WAS BLOWING AT RIGHT ANGLES IN SUMMER. IN THE WINTER, THE SHELTER EFFECT WAS MUCH LESS THAN IN THE SUMMER BUT THE TWO MOST DENSE SHELTERBELTS DID REDUCE THE WIND SPEED CONSIDERABLY ALSO THEN. WHEN THE WIND WAS BLOWING AT AN ANGLE TO THE SHELTERBELT, THE LEE MAXIMUM OCCURRED CLOSER TO THE BELT AND THE WIND SPEED RECOVERED FASTER THAN WHEN IT BLEW AT RIGHT ANGLES. THE WIND REDUCTION JUST BEHIND A SHELTERBELT ALWAYS TENDED TO BE GREATER IN OBLIQUE THAN IN PERPENDICULAR WIND. THE WIND REDUCTION BEHIND A LEAFY VEGETATION BELT DECREASED AS THE REFERENCE WIND SPEED INCREASED. THE APPROACH WIND SPEED AFFECTED WIND REDUCTION MUCH MORE AT A POROUS SHELTERBELT THAN AT A DENSE ONE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REFERENCE AND LOCAL WIND DIRECTIONS COULD BE GREAT JUST BEHIND A SHELTERBELT BUT THIS DIFFERENCE DISAPPEARED WITHIN A FEW H DOWNSTREAM OF THE BELT.

HISTORICALLY, CROP PRODUCERS HAVE BEEN UNSURE OF THE MERITS OF SHELTERBELTS, ESPECIALLY IF NEARBY CROPS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE INFESTED BY INSECT PESTS AS A RESULT. IN THIS STUDY, BEAN LEAF BEETLE ADULTS WERE SAMPLED DURING THE SEASON BY VISUALLY COUNTING THE NUMBER OF BEETLES FOUND ON SOYBEAN PLANTS EARLY IN THE SEASON AND BY SWEEP NET SAMPLING ONCE PLANTS WERE AT THE V4 STAGE (APPROXIMATELY 0.33 M TALL). SAMPLING WAS DONE IN 1997 AND 1998 AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER IN SAUNDERS CO. IN EAST-CENTRAL NEBRASKA. BEETLE COUNTS WERE COMPARED BETWEEN SHELTERBELT-PROTECTED AND -UNPROTECTED FIELDS. IN GENERAL. BEAN LEAF BEETLES WERE MORE NUMEROUS IN 1997 THAN IN 1998, WITH ABUNDANCE PEAKS OCCURRING IN LATE-JULY AND EARLY-SEPTEMBER IN BOTH YEARS. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN BEAN LEAF BEETLE COUNTS FROM PROTECTED AND UNPROTECTED FIELDS ON ONLY THREE OF THE 11 AND FOUR OF THE 13 SAMPLING DATES IN 1997 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY. ON THE SAMPLING DATES WHEN SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND, TWO OF THREE IN 1997 AND THREE OF FOUR IN 1998 HAD HIGHER BEAN LEAF BEETLE ABUNDANCE IN THE PROTECTED SOYBEAN FIELDS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY INDICATE A TENDENCY FOR MORE BEAN LEAF BEETLES IN SHELTERBELT-PROTECTED SOYBEAN FIELDS WHEN DIFFERENCES ARE FOUND, BUT BEETLE NUMBERS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN PROTECTED AND UNPROTECTED FIELDS ON THE MAJORITY OF SAMPLE DATES IN THE TWO YEARS OF THIS STUDY.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF VEGETATION TYPE, WIDTH OF THE FILTER STRIP, RUNOFF FLOW RATE AND INFLOW SEDIMENT CHARACTERISTICS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF THE VFS IN REMOVING POLLUTANTS FROM RUNOFF. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT SEDIMENT REMOVAL EFFICIENCY INCREASED FROM 50 TO 98% AS THE WIDTH OF THE FILTER INCREASED FROM 2.5 TO 20 M. IN ADDITION TO THE WIDTH OF THE FILTER STRIP, GRASS TYPE AND FLOW RATE WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANT FACTORS.

MANAGING FIELD MARGINS IN A WAY THAT PRESERVES, AND PREFERABLY ENHANCES, THEIR VALUE FOR BIODIVERSITY IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE EVALUATE HOW THE FLORA OF UNCULTIVATED FIELD MARGINS IS AFFECTED BY THE REMOVAL OF WOODY VEGETATION AS PRESCRIBED BY AN AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEME (AES) UNDER THE SWEDISH RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 2007–2013. WE USED GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS AND DETRENDED CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS TO COMPARE THE FLORA OF OPEN (CLEARED) AND MORE OVERGROWN FIELD MARGINS, LOCATED WITHIN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES OF DIFFERENT COMPLEXITY, IN SCANIA, S. SWEDEN. AS EXPECTED, THERE WAS A NEGATIVE EFFECT OF MANAGEMENT ON WOODY SPECIES. HOWEVER, THE LOCAL (1M2) AND TRANSECT (100 M) LEVEL RICHNESS OF NON-WOODY SPECIES DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN MANAGEMENT CATEGORIES, AND THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN THE WITHIN-TRANSECT VARIABILITY OF NON-WOODY SPECIES (LOCAL B DIVERSITY) OR THE SPECIES COMPOSITION (0.25M2 PLOTS) IN MANAGED AND UNMANAGED FIELD MARGINS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE REMOVAL OF WOODY VEGETATION FROM UNCULTIVATED FIELD MARGINS, AS PRESCRIBED BY THE EVALUATED AES, IS UNLIKELY TO BENEFIT NON-WOODY PLANT SPECIES. THE SPECIES COMPOSITION OF THE SAMPLED FIELD MARGINS SUGGESTS THAT INCLUSION OF APPROPRIATE FIELD LAYER MANAGEMENT ALONE IS UNLIKELY TO BE SUFFICIENT TO IMPROVE HABITAT CONDITIONS FOR GRASSLAND SPECIES UNLESS MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO COUNTERACT EUTROPHICATION. LANDSCAPE TYPE, ON THE OTHER HAND, INFLUENCED BOTH THE TOTAL RICHNESS AND THE RICHNESS OF EACH OF THE SPECIES GROUPS THAT WERE CONSIDERED TO BE OF PARTICULAR CONSERVATION VALUE IN THE PRESENT STUDY: FIELD MARGINS IN THE COMPLEX AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY RICHER THAN THOSE IN THE SIMPLE ONES. MAINTAINING NON-CROP HABITAT AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE IS LIKELY TO BE A NECESSARY FIRST STEP IN THE PREVENTION OF A FURTHER DECLINE OF FARMLAND PLANTS.

OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO EVALUATE THE INFLUENCE OF A BOTTOMLAND HEDGEROW ON WATER FLUX IN THE SATURATED AND UNSATURATED ZONES. SOIL WATER MOVEMENT WAS INVESTIGATED IN A HILLSLOPE CROSSED BY A HEDGEROW USING TOTAL WATER-POTENTIAL GRADIENTS AND SHALLOW GROUNDWATER DYNAMICS. RESULTS OF A DRY YEAR WERE PRESENTED BY GHAZAVI ET AL. (2008). IN THIS STUDY, WE ANALYSE A WET YEAR AND THEN COMPARE THE TWO CONTRASTING YEARS (DRY AND WET). DURING THE 2 YEARS, THE SOIL LOCATED AT THE VICINITY OF THE HEDGEROW DEVELOPED A DRIER STATUS THAN THE SURROUNDING SOILS. WATER FLUX IN THE UNSATURATED ZONE WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE HEDGEROW FOR A LONGER PERIOD DURING THE DRY YEAR THAN THE WET YEAR. THE DURATION OF DELAYED REWETTING OF THE SOIL DECREASED FROM 3 MONTHS FOR THE DRY YEAR TO 1 MONTH FOR THE WET YEAR. VARIATION IN WATER STORAGE CALCULATED OVER THE STUDY PERIOD WAS HIGHEST NEAR THE HEDGEROW AND LOWEST FAR FROM THE HEDGEROW.; ; ; ; IN THE HILLSLOPE STUDIED, HEDGEROW AND STREAM PROXIMITY CONTROLLED WATER TRANSFER. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE HEDGEROW CONTROLLED WATER TRANSFER IN THE UNSATURATED ZONE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, EXCEPT FOR THE PERIOD WHEN THE SOIL PROFILE WAS FULLY SATURATED. FIRST, HEDGEROWS CONTROL WATER TRANSFER BY INCREASING LATERAL TRANSFER, WHICH IS RELATED TO HIGH SOIL WATER POTENTIAL GRADIENTS IN ITS VICINITY. THESE PROCESSES MAY INCREASE CAPILLARY RISE AND DECREASE GROUNDWATER RECHARGE NEAR THE HEDGEROW. SECOND, REVERSE HYDRAULIC GRADIENT (UPWARD FLUX OF WATER) OCCURRED DURING THE PERIOD OF LOWEST GROUNDWATER LEVEL, MAINLY BECAUSE OF GROUNDWATER AND STREAM CONNECTIVITY. PROCESSES RELATED TO HEDGEROW PRESENCE, SUCH AS DELAYED SOIL REWETTING AND FLOW TOWARDS THE HEDGEROW NEED TO BE CONSIDERED TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF LINEAR VEGETATION STRUCTURES ON WATER FLUX.

HOWEVER, SUCH STRIPS DO NOT INTERCEPT ALL CONTAMINANTS, PARTICULARLY SOLUBLE ONES. ALTHOUGH PREFERENTIAL FLOW (PF) HAS BEEN SUGGESTED AS ONE FACTOR AMONG SEVERAL DECREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF BUFFER STRIPS, THE MECHANISMS INVOLVED ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. THIS PROJECT EXAMINES BUFFER STRIP EFFICIENCY AT INTERCEPTING SOLUTES WHEN SUBSURFACE PF OCCURS. TWO SOLUBLE SORBED TRACERS, FD&C BLUE #1 AND RHODAMINE WT, WERE APPLIED ON AN AGRICULTURAL SANDY LOAM SOIL TO EVALUATE THE ABILITY OF A NATURALLY VEGETATED BUFFER STRIP TO INTERCEPT SOLUBLE CONTAMINANTS. RHODAMINE WAS APPLIED ABOUT 15 M FROM THE CREEK, WHILE THE BLUE WAS APPLIED 15 M TO 165 M FROM THE CREEK. TRACER CONCENTRATION WAS MEASURED OVER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD IN BOTH THE CREEK AND THE BUFFER STRIP THROUGH SOIL AND WATER SAMPLES.

THE SCOTTISH AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE (SAC) HAS INVESTIGATED WHETHER FENCING OFF THE MARGINS OF SUCH FIELDS NEXT TO WATERCOURSES TO CONTROL DIFFUSE POLLUTION HAS ANY POSITIVE IMPACTS ON BIODIVERSITY, BASED ON ASSESSMENTS OF VEGETATION COMPOSITION AND CONDITION AND STRUCTURE OF ASSEMBLAGES OF INVERTEBRATES OF IMPORTANCE AS FOODSTUFFS TO FARMLAND BIRDS. FENCING WATERCOURSES INCREASED THE ABUNDANCE OF KEY GROUPS OF INVERTEBRATES. HOWEVER, THE INVERTEBRATE SPECIES DIVERSITY WAS NOT INCREASED UNLESS THE MARGINS WERE ≥ 5.4 M IN WIDTH. MARGINS ESTABLISHED IN THE STUDY AREA TO PREVENT ACCESS BY LIVESTOCK TO WATERCOURSES OR TO ENHANCE BIODIVERSITY ARE GENERALLY ≤ 2.6 M WIDE AND ARE THEREFORE UNLIKELY TO PROVIDE CONDITIONS FOR ADDITIONAL INVERTEBRATE SPECIES TO USE. THE DENSE, TALL SWARDS WITHIN SUCH MARGINS ARE ALSO UNLIKELY TO PROVIDE FORAGING OPPORTUNITIES FOR FARMLAND BIRDS. MANAGEMENT (SUCH AS LOW-INTENSITY GRAZING BY LIVESTOCK IN THE MARGINS) IS ESSENTIAL TO PROVIDE THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED FOR THESE GROUPS, BUT THIS COULD CONFLICT WITH THE DIFFUSE POLLUTION MITIGATION AIMS. A COMPROMISE IS PROPOSED WHEREBY LIMITED AUTUMN/WINTER GRAZING BY LIVESTOCK COULD BE USED TO OPEN THE VEGETATION STRUCTURE IN THE MARGINS. GRAZING BY LIVESTOCK AT THAT TIME MAY BE ACCEPTABLE SINCE IT IS NOT OCCURRING IN THE PERIOD OF MAIN DIFFUSE POLLUTION CONCERN (I.E., THE FECAL CONTAMINATION OF WATERCOURSES AND BATHING WATERS IN THE SPRING AND SUMMER). IT IS ALSO ESSENTIAL THAT A LANDSCAPE-SCALE APPROACH IS TAKEN, DRIVEN BY KNOWLEDGE OF THE FULL NEEDS OF THE SPECIES CONCERNED, WHEN DECIDING WHERE BEST TO TARGET AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIONS AIMED AT FARMLAND BIRD CONSERVATION.","41","2","355","363","BIODIVERSITY; VEGETATION; GEOGRAPHY; GRASSLAND; RIPARIAN BUFFER; GRAZING; BIRD CONSERVATION; BUFFER STRIP; FENCING; AGROFORESTRY","","AGRICULTURE/METHODS; ANIMALS; BIODIVERSITY; COLEOPTERA/CLASSIFICATION; CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES/METHODS; PLANTS/ANATOMY & HISTOLOGY; SOIL/CHEMISTRY; TIME FACTORS; WATER POLLUTION, CHEMICAL/PREVENTION & CONTROL","SOIL","SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT","https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2134/jeq2010.0532 https://pure.sruc.ac.uk/en/publications/improving-the-farmland-biodiversity-value-of-riparian-buffer-stri https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2134/jeq2010.0532 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22370397","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.2134/JEQ2010.0532","22370397","10.2134/jeq2010.0532","1985177071","","0","002-900-720-944-007; 003-251-732-418-644; 011-749-985-776-165; 014-204-563-886-62X; 018-202-918-339-630; 018-426-147-707-10X; 019-622-915-734-27X; 020-024-935-817-641; 020-499-086-546-478; 021-419-559-384-303; 029-067-159-542-004; 029-264-530-643-997; 030-766-878-238-058; 030-831-977-852-027; 032-374-633-920-032; 034-922-021-577-840; 044-379-480-034-205; 049-224-085-719-269; 049-346-208-924-920; 051-685-596-945-405; 054-715-078-148-813; 055-730-724-648-110; 056-310-930-873-816; 057-320-496-419-500; 060-303-879-790-212; 061-097-208-498-837; 063-580-919-095-500; 065-941-754-623-005; 068-452-604-669-157; 070-194-102-378-889; 071-245-262-326-969; 071-363-274-178-219; 081-198-292-463-95X; 092-151-348-850-74X; 095-014-169-963-827; 104-230-077-662-702; 105-301-641-863-030; 106-009-107-218-603; 108-396-753-252-799; 122-159-545-592-770; 123-195-638-496-459; 125-665-410-415-022; 125-995-631-935-63X; 150-451-331-765-852; 155-691-175-864-748; 165-804-108-473-473; 169-189-318-034-229; 177-065-972-610-361; 199-433-297-667-317","27","DAVID I.

IN INTENSIVELY FARMED AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES, MANY SPECIES ARE CONFINED TO VERY SMALL UNCULTIVATED AREAS SUCH AS FIELD MARGINS. HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THESE SMALL HABITAT ELEMENTS CANNOT SUPPORT VIABLE POPULATIONS OF ALL THE SPECIES OBSERVED THERE. INSTEAD, SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE IN THESE SMALL HABITAT FRAGMENTS MAY, AT LEAST PARTLY, BE DEPENDENT ON DISPERSAL FROM LARGER SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND FRAGMENTS.2. WE TESTED THIS HYPOTHESIS FOR BUTTERFLIES AND BUMBLE BEES IN 12 INDEPENDENT LANDSCAPES IN A REGION OF INTENSE AGRICULTURE IN SOUTHERN SWEDEN. IN EACH LANDSCAPE WE SURVEYED ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS IN ONE SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND, ONE LINEAR HABITAT (UNCULTIVATED FIELD MARGIN) ADJACENT TO THIS (CALLED PROXIMATE) AND ONE SIMILAR LINEAR HABITAT (CALLED DISTANT) SITUATED AT LEAST 1000 M FROM THE SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND PATCH.3. BOTH SPECIES RICHNESS AND DENSITY (INDIVIDUALS PER UNIT AREA) OF BUTTERFLIES AND BUMBLE BEES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN PROXIMATE LINEAR HABITATS THAN IN DISTANT ONES. MOREOVER, BUTTERFLY SPECIES RICHNESS WAS HIGHER FOR A GIVEN AREA IN GRASSLANDS THAN IN ANY OF THE LINEAR HABITAT TYPES. BUTTERFLY DENSITY IN GRASSLANDS DID NOT DIFFER FROM THAT IN PROXIMATE LINEAR HABITATS BUT WAS LOWER IN DISTANT LINEAR HABITATS. THE EFFECT OF ISOLATION ON DENSITY WAS STRONGER FOR LESS MOBILE BUTTERFLY SPECIES. FOR BUMBLE BEES THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN SPECIES RICHNESS BETWEEN GRASSLANDS AND PROXIMATE LINEAR HABITATS.4. FOR AT LEAST SOME OF THE BUTTERFLY SPECIES EVEN THESE RELATIVELY SMALL FRAGMENTS OF SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS ACT AS POPULATION SOURCES FROM WHICH INDIVIDUALS DISPERSE TO THE SURROUNDING HABITATS AND THEREBY CONTRIBUTE TO HIGHER DENSITIES AND SPECIES RICHNESS IN ADJACENT AREAS. FOR BUMBLE BEES, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT THE GRASSLANDS CONTAIN A HIGHER DENSITY OF NESTS THAN THE SURROUNDING INTENSIVELY CULTIVATED LANDSCAPE, AND THAT THE DENSITY OF FORAGING BUMBLE BEES DECREASES WITH INCREASING DISTANCE FROM THE NEST.5. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATION. HABITAT FRAGMENTATION AND INTENSIFIED AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE A THREAT AGAINST SERVICES PROVIDED BY POLLINATORS. IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN THE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF INSECT POLLINATORS IN INTENSIVELY FARMED AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES, WE SUGGEST THAT PRESERVATION OF THE REMAINING SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS OR RE-CREATION OF FLOWER-RICH GRASSLANDS IS ESSENTIAL.","44","1","50","59","HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; GRASSLAND; POPULATION; BIOLOGICAL DISPERSAL; SPECIES RICHNESS; SPECIES DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE (ECOLOGY); BIOLOGY","","","","","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01250.x/abstract https://www.jstor.org/stable/4123824 https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/dff24daf-d15c-4c76-8119-e5efe41e2b57 https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01250.x https://portal.research.lu.se/portal/en/publications/seminatural-grasslands-as-population-sources-for-pollinating-insects-in-agricultural-landscapes(dff24daf-d15c-4c76-8119-e5efe41e2b57).html https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01250.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01250.x","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1365-2664.2006.01250.X","","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01250.x","2129636730","","0","001-718-132-298-304; 002-196-750-704-673; 004-281-677-682-461; 005-168-109-694-810; 008-167-536-662-383; 008-225-619-668-580; 010-907-813-822-262; 011-363-201-170-412; 011-715-981-140-308; 012-267-243-122-028; 013-963-568-587-742; 014-590-282-698-428; 015-218-134-012-477; 015-782-011-641-991; 016-668-772-079-670; 017-465-919-368-503; 020-468-391-112-375; 024-940-486-253-797; 031-094-771-196-289; 031-216-949-664-784; 032-474-236-800-115; 033-146-014-362-627; 033-679-811-867-654; 034-653-724-020-632; 035-775-229-294-961; 042-511-627-752-926; 048-244-533-318-55X; 049-128-080-437-254; 050-418-767-246-092; 050-907-802-597-89X; 053-367-247-740-718; 057-720-330-037-206; 061-767-872-857-957; 068-452-604-669-157; 075-638-674-736-334; 077-648-752-937-927; 079-068-774-342-74X; 079-166-448-550-892; 079-492-501-193-26X; 083-810-224-480-214; 094-506-716-348-263; 096-920-887-442-138; 098-312-271-690-700; 108-814-507-291-345; 112-410-864-747-674; 112-917-317-852-89X; 114-480-653-531-829; 115-537-551-650-895; 117-233-951-265-769; 129-806-252-951-533; 129-943-317-995-23X; 141-005-140-982-524; 142-624-071-999-929; 144-066-499-137-261; 154-386-144-197-99X; 165-420-840-117-725; 168-312-770-361-773; 178-850-274-409-230; 185-374-982-166-638; 194-791-518-890-554; 197-230-959-170-770","351","ERIK ÖCKINGER; HENRIK G.

THERE WAS ALWAYS A TREND OF INCREASING YIELD FROM THE EDGE OF THE FIELD TO THE CENTRE, WITH A MARKED REDUCTION AROUND THE ‘TRAMLINES’ AND THE AREA WHERE MACHINERY TURNS. IN THE STUDIES ON COMMERCIAL FARMS, HEADLAND YIELD LOSS VARIED WIDELY. IN SUGAR BEET THE HEADLANDS YIELDED 19–41% LESS THAN THE CENTRE, WITH A MEAN REDUCTION OF 26%. IN CEREALS THE RANGE WAS 3–19%, WITH A MEAN LOSS OF 7%. HEADLAND YIELD REDUCTIONS WERE GENERALLY SMALLER IN THE FIELD EXPERIMENTS THAN THOSE FOUND ON COMMERCIAL FARMS. THESE HEADLAND EFFECTS DID NOT MOVE TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THE FIELD WHEN GRASS MARGINS WERE PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF THE FIELD; THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE YIELD OF THE ADJACENT CROP. THE PRESENCE OF BOUNDARY TREES HAD THE GREATEST EFFECT ON YIELD: IN THE OUTER 9 M OF THE FIELD, THE AREA SHADED BY TREES PRODUCED 4.4 T HA-1 OF WHEAT, AND THE AREA THAT WAS NOT SHADED 8.1 T HA-1. TURNING OF MACHINERY ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED YIELD, WHILE GRAZING BY RABBITS AND HARES SURPRISINGLY HAD NO EFFECT.; ; ; ; FOLLOWING THE REFORM OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY IN 1992, THE MAIN EFFECT OF WHICH WAS TO CHANGE FROM A PRICE SUPPORT POLICY TO DIRECT PAYMENTS TO PRODUCERS, FARMERS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WHO PRODUCE MORE THAN A SPECIFIED TONNAGE OF ‘ELIGIBLE CROPS’ PER YEAR, ARE REQUIRED TO FALLOW A GIVEN PERCENTAGE OF THEIR LAND (CURRENTLY 5%), TO QUALIFY FOR ARABLE AREA PAYMENTS. GROWERS CAN ELECT TO FALLOW FIELDS ON A ROTATIONAL BASIS, OR PERMANENTLY. HEADLAND SET-ASIDE IS A TERM USED TO DESCRIBE STRIPS OF SET-ASIDE, A MINIMUM OF 20 M WIDE AROUND THE EDGES OF FIELDS. IN THESE EXPERIMENTS, THE HEADLAND EFFECT DID NOT EXTEND BEYOND 20 M FROM THE FIELD EDGE. THEREFORE, PARTICULARLY IN FIELDS WITH BOUNDARY HEDGES OR TREES, HEADLAND SET-ASIDE COULD EFFECTIVELY REMOVE THE POOR-YIELDING AREA AT THE FIELD MARGIN.","132","1","129","142","CROP; HEADLAND; COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY; SUGAR BEET; GRAZING; EUROPEAN UNION; YIELD (FINANCE); AGRONOMY; ARABLE LAND; BIOLOGY","","","","","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1744-7348.1998.tb05190.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-7348.1998.tb05190.x","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1744-7348.1998.TB05190.X","","10.1111/j.1744-7348.1998.tb05190.x","2018022032","","0","002-092-515-252-252; 007-004-204-791-127; 027-818-987-445-682; 030-191-735-591-52X; 087-625-788-327-953; 090-087-544-925-191; 091-165-444-995-827; 100-538-270-680-860","49","DEBBIE L.

GRASS BUFFER STRIPS ON CEREAL FIELD EDGES, TO REDUCE EROSION AND AGRO-CHEMICAL RUNOFF INTO SURFACE WATER, COULD BE USEFUL TO MITIGATE THIS DIVERSITY LOSS AS THEY ARE OFTEN ASSUMED TO PROVIDE REFUGE AND FOOD FOR INVERTEBRATES, SMALL MAMMALS AND BIRDS. EVIDENCE FOR THIS IDEA IS, HOWEVER, SCARCE AND IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHETHER DENSELY VEGETATED BUFFER STRIPS BENEFIT BIODIVERSITY IN STRUCTURALLY COMPLEX LANDSCAPES OF NORTHERN EUROPE. HERE, WE EXAMINED WHETHER BUFFER STRIPS AFFECTED BREEDING SKYLARK ALAUDA AVENSIS NUMBERS AND ITS MAIN FOOD SUPPLY (I.E. BEETLES COLEOPTERA AND SPIDERS ARACHNIDA) ON CEREAL FIELDS IN A HETEROGENEOUS AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE OF SOUTH-CENTRAL SWEDEN. WE ALSO EXAMINED WHETHER BUFFER STRIP EFFECTS ON SKYLARK DENSITY DEPENDED ON SEASONAL SWARD HEIGHT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SOWING REGIMES (SPRING- VS. AUTUMN-SOWN) AS THEY PRESUMABLY INFLUENCE SEASONAL INVERTEBRATE ACCESSIBILITY. FIELDS WITH BUFFER STRIPS SUPPORTED ON AVERAGE 0.51 ± 0.26 MORE SKYLARK TERRITORIES PER HECTARE UP TO 100 M INTO THE FIELD AND BOOSTED INVERTEBRATE ACTIVITY DENSITIES COMPARED TO FIELDS WITHOUT BUFFER STRIPS. THESE EFFECTS WERE MOST APPARENT EARLY IN SPRING, BUT PERSISTED THROUGHOUT THE SAMPLING PERIOD, AND WERE SIMILAR AMONG SPRING AND AUTUMN SOWN FIELDS. THUS, OUR RESULTS PROVIDE EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT BUFFER STRIPS TARGET MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES ON CEREAL FIELDS IN HETEROGENEOUS FARMLAND. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD WORK TO IDENTIFY BUFFER STRIP MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT FURTHER INCREASE THEIR VALUE TO BIODIVERSITY AT THE LOCAL SCALE, AND INVESTIGATE HOW THEY AFFECT FARMLAND BIODIVERSITY IN DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE TYPES AT LARGER SPATIAL SCALES FOR MORE EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION ACROSS EUROPE.","181","","101","107","AGRICULTURE; BIODIVERSITY; INVERTEBRATE; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; ALAUDA; BUFFER STRIP; SURFACE RUNOFF; ARABLE LAND","","","","","https://gylle.dk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AGEE4478.pdf http://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND500712028 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880913003277","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.AGEE.2013.09.018","","10.1016/j.agee.2013.09.018","2155364252","","0","000-885-126-513-33X; 001-245-154-727-571; 007-416-181-403-689; 009-186-315-950-664; 011-508-246-956-659; 014-373-326-060-805; 018-827-096-171-575; 019-895-404-309-400; 022-647-096-479-517; 024-541-655-270-945; 026-766-790-225-506; 028-571-906-311-784; 030-761-865-260-149; 031-206-874-111-261; 031-592-787-048-258; 032-293-004-868-425; 032-390-963-080-355; 033-653-560-827-440; 035-947-335-206-732; 039-713-843-119-305; 043-009-269-441-396; 046-513-869-126-279; 049-557-478-030-177; 051-824-580-453-278; 052-363-993-930-092; 054-585-052-877-054; 054-715-078-148-813; 056-789-845-462-569; 062-958-100-407-68X; 064-297-474-959-451; 064-454-510-982-621; 067-095-582-035-356; 068-123-496-822-558; 068-452-604-669-157; 069-374-450-187-256; 076-863-055-982-955; 080-139-567-968-521; 086-560-114-271-630; 088-581-927-426-949; 095-869-161-076-004; 099-707-266-271-651; 104-230-077-662-702; 110-673-327-117-273; 115-123-313-615-824; 117-345-687-903-78X; 119-352-383-206-342; 120-487-356-582-40X; 120-514-812-606-235; 124-079-930-184-362; 125-357-678-676-499; 127-029-369-930-692; 131-232-875-121-714; 133-858-248-195-498; 141-000-789-286-280; 143-273-453-722-006; 145-728-200-767-581; 147-069-899-966-299; 149-200-651-727-319; 150-325-162-873-23X; 155-691-175-864-748; 158-040-572-868-750; 160-615-618-554-973; 168-507-357-881-230; 170-044-763-432-805; 172-225-641-596-161; 173-475-760-804-769; 173-731-784-504-55X; 179-048-991-295-983; 188-485-343-828-456; 195-618-519-387-640","22","JONAS JOSEFSSON; ÅKE BERG; MATTHEW HIRON; TOMAS PÄRT; SÖNKE EGGERS","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","","LENS",0,"JOSEFSSON J, 2013, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","JOSEFSSON J, 2013, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT"

THIS PAPER PRESENTS RESULTS FROM HYDROMETRIC MONITORING OF RIPARIAN BUFFER HYDROLOGY IN A PASTURE CATCHMENT. RUNOFF PROCESSES AND RIPARIAN FLOWPATHS WERE INVESTIGATED ON TWO PLANAR HILLSLOPES WITH REGENERATING GRASS AND E. GLOBULUS BUFFERS. SURFACE RUNOFF AND SUBSURFACE FLOWS (A- AND B-HORIZONS) WERE MEASURED FOR 3 YEARS USING SURFACE RUNOFF COLLECTORS, SUBSURFACE TROUGHS AND PIEZOMETERS. WATER VOLUMES MOVING THROUGH THE RIPARIAN BUFFERS VIA THE MEASURED FLOWPATHS WERE RANKED B-HORIZON ≫ SURFACE RUNOFF ≈ A-HORIZON. RUNOFF VOLUMES THROUGH THE B-HORIZON TROUGHS WERE AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE GREATER THAN THOSE RECORDED FOR THE MOST PRODUCTIVE SURFACE RUNOFF PLOTS OR THE A-HORIZON TROUGHS. SUBSURFACE RUNOFF AND SATURATION-EXCESS OVERLAND FLOW (SOF) WERE LIMITED TO THE WINTER MONTHS, WHEREAS INFILTRATION-EXCESS OVERLAND FLOW (IEOF) CAN OCCUR ALL YEAR ROUND DURING INTENSE STORMS. SURFACE RUNOFF WAS RECORDED ON 33 OCCASIONS, MOSTLY DURING WINTER (LATE MAY–EARLY OCTOBER), AND TOTAL ANNUAL SURFACE RUNOFF VOLUMES COLLECTED BY THE 20 UNCONFINED (2 M WIDE) RUNOFF PLOTS VARIED BETWEEN > 80 AND < 20 M3. SUBSURFACE FLOW ONLY OCCURRED IN WINTER, AND THE 6 M WIDE B-HORIZON SUBSURFACE TROUGHS FLOWED ABOVE 1 L S−1 CONTINUOUSLY, WHEREAS THE A-HORIZON TROUGHS FLOWED INFREQUENTLY (<6 DAYS PER YEAR). IN SUMMER, SURFACE RUNOFF OCCURRED AS IEOF DURING INTENSE STORMS IN THE E. GLOBULUS BUFFER, BUT NOT IN THE GRASS BUFFER. OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT SURFACE CRUSTING REDUCED THE SOIL'S INFILTRATION CAPACITY IN THE E. GLOBULUS BUFFER. DURING WINTER, SOF AND SEEPAGE WERE OBSERVED IN BOTH BUFFERS, BUT SUBSURFACE FLOW THROUGH THE B-HORIZON WAS THE DOMINANT FLOWPATH. KEY HYDROLOGIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GRASS AND TREE BUFFERS ARE THE GENERATION OF IEOF IN THE E. GLOBULUS BUFFER DURING INTENSE SUMMER STORMS, AND THE SMALLER SUBSURFACE RUNOFF VOLUMES AND FEWER FLOW DAYS IN THE E. GLOBULUS BUFFER. LOW SURFACE RUNOFF VOLUMES ARE LIKELY TO LIMIT THE POTENTIAL OF THESE BUFFERS TO FILTER POLLUTANTS FROM SURFACE RUNOFF. HIGH SUBSURFACE FLOW VOLUMES AND SATURATED CONDUCTIVITIES ARE ALSO LIKELY TO LIMIT THE RESIDENCE TIME OF WATER IN THE SUBSURFACE DOMAIN. BASED ON THEIR HYDROLOGIC PERFORMANCE, THE KEY ROLES OF RIPARIAN BUFFERS IN THIS LANDSCAPE ARE LIKELY TO BE DISPLACING SEDIMENT AND NUTRIENT-GENERATING ACTIVITIES AWAY FROM STREAMS AND STABILIZING CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY.

HOWEVER, INFORMATION ON THE LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT OF FIELD MARGIN PLANT COMMUNITIES REMAINS LIMITED. WE DESCRIBE A LONG-TERM EXPERIMENT ON THE EFFECTS OF FIELD MARGIN MANAGEMENT ON BIODIVERSITY AND WEED SPECIES. SWARDS WERE ESTABLISHED BY NATURAL REGENERATION OR SOWING A GRASS AND WILDFLOWER SEED MIXTURE, AND TREATMENTS MANIPULATED THE FREQUENCY AND TIMING OF MOWING, APPLICATION OF HERBICIDE AND LEAVING OF HAY. VEGETATION WAS MONITORED TO EVALUATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH EARLY CONCLUSIONS REMAINED VALID AFTER 13 YEARS. ALTHOUGH EARLY SUCCESSIONAL TRENDS SUGGESTED THAT NATURALLY REGENERATED SWARDS WOULD RAPIDLY BECOME DOMINATED BY PERNICIOUS PERENNIAL WEEDS, AND THAT SOWN SWARDS WOULD EXCLUDE SUCH SPECIES, NEITHER WAS TRUE IN THE LONGER TERM. SOWN SWARDS WERE EVENTUALLY INVADED BY UNSOWN PERENNIALS, BUT THEY REMAINED DISTINCT FROM NATURALLY REGENERATED SWARDS. PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS DECLINED THROUGHOUT THE EXPERIMENT. ANNUALS WERE LOST MOST RAPIDLY FROM SOWN SWARDS BUT, UNDER NATURAL REGENERATION, LOSS COULD BE MODIFIED BY MOWING. PERENNIAL SPECIES INITIALLY INCREASED DURING NATURAL REGENERATION BEFORE STABILISING. IN SOWN SWARDS THEY DECLINED UNDER ALL TREATMENTS. SPECIES RICHNESS IN NATURALLY REGENERATING SWARDS WAS PROMOTED INITIALLY BY MOWING TWICE ANNUALLY. AFTER 13 YEARS, TIMING AND FREQUENCY OF MOWING HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON SPECIES RICHNESS ALTHOUGH IT STILL INFLUENCED SWARD COMPOSITION. LEAVING CUT HAY LYING PRODUCED SPECIES-POOR SWARDS.

IT IS UNKNOWN HOW SUCH A GWW AFFECTS THE LOADING OF SURFACE RUNOFF WITH DISSOLVED REACTIVE PHOSPHORUS (DRP). THE EFFECT ON DRP WAS TESTED IN A LANDSCAPE-SCALE STUDY WHERE DRP CONCENTRATIONS AND LOADS IN SURFACE RUNOFF WERE MEASURED IN TWO WATERSHEDS IN WHICH GWWS WERE NEWLY INSTALLED AND INCREASED IN EFFECTIVENESS OVER TIME. BOTH WATERSHEDS WERE COMPARED WITH PAIRED WATERSHEDS WITHOUT GWW INSTALLATION; ALL WATERSHEDS WERE CONTINUOUSLY MONITORED OVER 5 YR (1993-1997). ADDITIONALLY, DRP CONCENTRATIONS WERE MEASURED IN OPEN FIELD AND THROUGHFALL PRECIPITATION UNDER GROWING GRASS AND CROPS IN FIELD EXPERIMENTS, AND DRP CONCENTRATIONS IN SURFACE RUNOFF FROM STRAW COVERED SURFACES WERE DETERMINED WITH LABORATORY RAINFALL SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS. DISSOLVED REACTIVE P IN THROUGHFALL FOR THE DIFFERENT COVER TYPES WAS HIGHLY VARIABLE, AND THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS (UP TO 2.8 MG L(-1)) OCCURRED ESPECIALLY DURING FLOWERING OF THE RESPECTIVE CROP AND AFTER FROST EVENTS. DISSOLVED REACTIVE P CONCENTRATIONS IN RUNOFF FROM STRAW-COVERED SURFACES WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH THOSE FROM BARE SOIL. ON AVERAGE, THERE WAS A SMALL DIFFERENCE IN DRP CONCENTRATIONS BETWEEN THROUGHFALL UNDER GROWING CROPS AND GRASS AND IN RUNOFF FROM BARE OR STRAW COVERED SOIL SURFACES.

THIS FINDING WAS SUPPORTED BY THE WATERSHED DATA, WHERE WATERSHEDS WITH AND WITHOUT GWW SHOWED SIMILAR DRP CONCENTRATIONS. NO CHANGE IN DRP CONCENTRATIONS OCCURRED OVER THE 5-YR PERIOD. SUCH GWWS WILL THUS REDUCE THE DRP LOAD ANALOGOUSLY TO THE REDUCTION IN TOTAL SURFACE RUNOFF.","38","2","548","559","THROUGHFALL; GRASSED WATERWAY; SEDIMENT; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SURFACE RUNOFF; SOIL TEST; PHOSPHORUS; HYDROLOGY (AGRICULTURE); WATER POLLUTION","","AGRICULTURE; FRESH WATER/ANALYSIS; PHOSPHORUS/ANALYSIS; POACEAE; RAIN; SOIL/ANALYSIS; TIME FACTORS; WATER POLLUTANTS, CHEMICAL/ANALYSIS; WATER POLLUTION, CHEMICAL/PREVENTION & CONTROL","SOIL; WATER POLLUTANTS, CHEMICAL; PHOSPHORUS","GERMAN FEDERAL MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; BAVARIAN STATE MINISTRY FOR SCIENCE, RESEARCH AND ARTS","https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/38/2/548 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2007.0525 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19202025 https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/683833 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/1456483 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093127481 https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/en/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=200902217211999790 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19202025/","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.2134/JEQ2007.0525","19202025","10.2134/jeq2007.0525","2051972525","","0","003-720-478-631-608; 007-213-949-920-174; 008-380-052-396-94X; 008-968-627-825-555; 009-169-915-488-894; 011-288-274-938-632; 014-082-686-261-694; 015-380-809-774-96X; 017-348-037-536-365; 017-420-773-610-643; 018-668-638-487-019; 019-202-060-856-384; 022-567-727-205-476; 025-328-478-167-931; 026-992-482-224-099; 028-829-445-521-695; 031-240-545-991-607; 034-334-168-340-855; 035-246-483-251-437; 036-113-962-479-612; 044-327-313-877-518; 046-747-744-517-198; 050-198-618-361-634; 055-780-583-733-471; 060-783-323-084-203; 065-672-467-427-885; 066-008-497-105-394; 069-886-182-022-795; 071-462-069-230-683; 075-667-485-324-237; 076-826-572-086-275; 077-781-210-698-143; 083-431-696-176-966; 083-600-173-903-321; 087-680-309-241-290; 088-236-621-248-724; 090-804-589-550-521; 093-618-789-768-162; 096-145-122-087-467; 097-460-493-803-721; 105-045-620-033-468; 106-284-569-265-355; 111-288-588-656-115; 111-652-243-743-385; 117-342-446-985-725; 117-346-312-542-660; 117-655-909-979-696; 119-211-912-940-114; 129-312-799-919-14X; 129-796-363-882-204; 131-813-452-905-563; 138-643-821-809-522; 146-403-246-969-235; 146-606-352-041-123; 147-212-481-476-232; 160-087-225-408-274; 170-591-128-283-41X; 186-047-051-900-345","14","PETER FIENER; KARL AUERSWALD","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY","","LENS",0,"FIENER P, 2009, JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY","FIENER P, 2009, JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY"

BIOTIC DIVERSITY AND SPECIES RESTORATION ARE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH HABITATS AND THUS PLANT COVER DIVERSITY. HUNGARIAN AGRICULTURE IS IN A STATE OF TRANSITION TOWARDS MARKET ORIENTED PRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT. CHANGES IN PROPERTY RIGHTS, FARM SIZE, LAND USE AND THE GREATER IMPORTANCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES DEMAND NEW APPROACHES FOR PLANT PROTECTION AND HABITAT EVALUATION. IN OUR STUDY SOME EXAMPLES WILL BE GIVEN SHOWING THE IMPORTANCE BOTH OF FIELDS AND FIELD MARGINS AND ABOUT THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO PLANT PROTECTION AND NATURE PRODUCTION. PLANT SPECIES AND PREDATORS (CARABIDS, SPIDERS) WERE STUDIED IN WINTER WHEAT FIELDS AND IN THE FIELD MARGINS. EVIDENCE WAS FOUND OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD MARGIN FOR THE NUMBER AND COMPOSITION OF PLANT SPECIES. PARALLEL TO THIS, CARABIDS AND SPIDERS (AS SIGNIFICANT PREDATORS) WERE STUDIED. FOR BOTH CARABIDS AND SPIDERS, SPECIES NUMBER AND DIVERSITY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN FIELD MARGINS COMPARED WITH FIELDS. THE SPECIES DISTRIBUTION OF CARABIDS AMONG THESE TWO DIFFERENT HABITATS, HOWEVER, INDICATES THAT SOME SPECIES ARE TYPICAL ‘FIELD SPECIES’.

WE COMPARED DENSITY, AVIAN RICHNESS, AND AVIAN CONSERVATION VALUE ON ROW-CROP FIELDS CONTAINING BUFFERS STRATEGICALLY DESIGNED FOR WILDLIFE VERSUS FIELDS WITHOUT BUFFERS IN 3 SOUTHEASTERN U.S. STATES DURING WINTER 2007 AND 2008. FIELDS WITH BUFFERS WERE ENROLLED IN U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM PRACTICE HABITAT BUFFERS FOR UPLAND BIRDS (CP33), WHICH TARGETS RESTORATION OF NORTHERN BOBWHITE (COLINUS VIRGINIANUS) AND OTHER UPLAND BIRD SPECIES. OVERALL SPECIES RICHNESS DID NOT DIFFER ON FIELDS WITH BUFFERS VERSUS FIELDS WITHOUT BUFFERS IN 2007, BUT WAS 29% GREATER ON FIELDS WITH BUFFERS IN 2008. SWAMP SPARROWS (MELOSPIZA GEORGIANA), SONG SPARROWS (M. MELODIA), FIELD SPARROWS (SPIZELLA PUSILLA), AND RED-BELLIED WOODPECKERS (MELANERPES CAROLINUS) HAD GREATER DENSITIES ON FIELDS WITH BUFFERS COMPARED WITH FIELDS WITHOUT BUFFERS. INCREASING FIELD-BUFFER WIDTH DID NOT RESULT IN GREATER BIRD DENSITIES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST A SMALL CHANGE IN PRIMARY LAND USE (≈7%) PRODUCED A DISPROPORTIONATE POPULATION RESPONSE BY SOME GRASSLAND-DEPENDENT AND WOODLAND BIRD SPECIES DURING WINTER.

THESE FLORAL TRAITS ARE LIKELY TO AFFECT THE FORAGING PERFORMANCE OF PARASITOIDS IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. USING A SPATIALLY EXPLICIT SIMULATION MODEL WE EXPLORE HOW THE ATTRACTIVENESS AND NECTAR AVAILABILITY OF FLOWERING FIELD MARGINS AFFECTS THEIR IMPACT ON PARASITOIDS AND ULTIMATELY ON PEST POPULATIONS IN CROPS. THE MODEL SIMULATES THE MOVEMENT, NECTAR FEEDING AND PARASITISM OF PARASITOIDS IN AN AGROECOSYSTEM COMPOSED OF A CROP AND ADJACENT FLOWER MARGIN. THE PERCEPTION OF OLFACTORY CUES EMITTED BY FLOWERS AND HOST-INFESTED PLANTS DRIVES THE MOVEMENT OF THE PARASITOID. ITS PREFERENCE FOR FLORAL NECTAR OR HOSTS IS DESCRIBED AS A FUNCTION OF ITS INTERNAL ENERGY STATUS. MODEL VALIDATION REVEALS THAT SIMULATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS OF THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND ENERGY STATUS OF PARASITOIDS ARE GENERALLY IN GOOD AGREEMENT. MODEL SIMULATIONS SUGGEST THAT AGGREGATION OF PARASITOIDS AT FLOWER STRIPS ARE CAUSED BY A PROLONGED LONGEVITY OF PARASITOIDS FEEDING ON FLORAL NECTAR AS WELL AS BY ATTRACTION OF PARASITOIDS FROM THE SURROUNDING AREA. WE FOUND NO INDICATION FOR DEPLETION OF PARASITOIDS IN THE FIELD INTERIOR AS A RESULT OF MIGRATION TOWARDS FLOWER STRIPS. SIMULATIONS FURTHER SUGGEST THAT THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF FLOWERS IS AN IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR THE SELECTION OF FLOWERING PLANTS.

THIS STUDY USES NO3−/CL− RATIOS, NATURAL ABUNDANCES OF15N AND18O IN NO3−, AND AN IN SITU15NO3− TRACER EXPERIMENT TO EVALUATE NO3− REDUCING PROCESSES OCCURRING IN GROUND WATER WITHIN A NARROW GRASSED BUFFER STRIP BORDERING A STREAM IN AN AGRICULTURAL WATERSHED. THE NO3−/CL− RATIOS (1.9-0.0 [M/M]) INDICATE THAT BOTH NO3− CONSUMING PROCESSES AND MIXING OF TWO GROUND WATER FLOW REGIMES WITH DIFFERENT NO3− LOADS CONTRIBUTE TO THE DROP OBSERVED IN GROUND WATER NO3− CONCENTRATIONS WITHIN THE RIPARIAN ZONE. Δ15N AND Δ18O OF THE GROUND WATER NO3− WITHIN THE RIPARIAN ZONE (Δ15N = 5.1 TO 48.8 %C; Δ18O = 1.1 TO 17.8 %C) WERE ENRICHED COMPARED TO THE GROUND WATER BELOW THE ADJACENT CULTIVATED FIELD (Δ15N = 3.8 TO 10.1 %0; Δ18O = 0.5 TO 6.2 %C). A SIGNIFICANT LINEAR RELATIONSHIP (R2=0.97) BETWEEN GROUND WATER Δ15N AND Δ18O IN NO3− WAS FOUND, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH NO3− CONSUMPTION BY MICROBIAL DENITRIFICATION.

WE USED PREDATOR EXCLUSION CAGES TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF WEED SEED REMOVAL CAUSED BY INVERTEBRATES AND VERTEBRATES. THREE COMMON AGRICULTURAL WEED SPECIES, RED- ROOT PIGWEED (AMARANTHUS RETROFLEXUS), BROADLEAF SIGNALGRASS (UROCHLOA PLATYPHYLLA), AND SICKLEPOD (SENNA OBTUSIFOLIA), WERE ADHERED TO INDIVIDUAL CARDS AND PLACED INSIDE THE EXCLOSURE CAGES ONCE A MONTH FOR TWO WEEKS. ACTIVITY-DENSITY OF INVERTEBRATE WEED SEED PREDATORS WAS MEASURED WITH PITFALL TRAPS. RESULTS SHOW THAT FIELD BORDER TYPE HAD NO EFFECT ON SEED REMOVAL RATES, BUT THAT CROP TYPE HEAVILY INFLUENCED BOTH WEED SEED PREDATION AND INVERTEBRATE SEED PREDATOR ACTIVITY-DENSITY. WEED SEED PREDATION WAS HIGHEST IN THE DENSE, PERENNIAL HAY FIELDS AND LOWEST IN THE MORE OPEN HARVESTED MAIZE FIELDS. ACTIVITY- DENSITIES FOR FIELD CRICKETS (GRYLLUS SP.) AND THE GROUND BEETLE HARPALUS PENNSYLVANICUS WERE ALSO HIGH IN THE HAY FIELDS AND LOW IN THE MAIZE FIELDS, WHILE THE RED IMPORTED FIRE ANT (SOLENOPSIS INVICTA) SEEMED TO PREFER THE OPEN MAIZE FIELDS. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT INCREASING VEGETATIVE DIVERSITY IN FIELD BORDERS IS NOT ALWAYS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR CONSERVING WEED SEED PREDATORS, BUT THAT HIGHER QUALITY HABITAT INSIDE THE CROP FIELD CAN BE ACHIEVED BY INCREASING GROUND COVER. © 2013 PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER B.V.","177","","58","62","CROP; VEGETATION; PREDATION; WEED; SEED PREDATION; EXCLOSURE; SENNA OBTUSIFOLIA; HARPALUS PENNSYLVANICUS; AGRONOMY; BIOLOGY","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016788091300203X","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.AGEE.2013.06.006","","10.1016/j.agee.2013.06.006","2152155369","","0","006-384-590-654-358; 009-065-626-813-973; 015-415-550-597-198; 021-026-931-239-376; 022-070-333-305-083; 031-114-644-626-51X; 034-210-790-826-930; 038-663-860-675-689; 041-747-216-894-684; 045-482-618-731-129; 047-588-514-493-494; 057-720-330-037-206; 057-898-374-057-282; 059-804-606-271-839; 067-445-194-832-019; 071-511-859-224-147; 074-504-972-959-800; 077-758-127-449-992; 081-708-465-596-353; 083-625-672-314-565; 087-186-786-234-321; 091-265-753-392-171; 095-536-501-019-116; 096-113-874-823-168; 100-986-860-964-168; 110-617-178-603-57X; 117-466-478-305-186; 140-355-039-582-52X; 183-925-859-507-535","19","AARON F.

HOWEVER FEW MODELS HAVE BEEN BUILT TO PREDICT THE EFFECTS OF FIELD MANAGEMENT ON THE FLORA. OUR PROJECT ADDRESSES THIS NEED FOR A MODEL CAPABLE OF PREDICTING THE EFFECT OF CROPPING TECHNIQUES AND THEIR TIMING ON THE FLORA OF FIELD MARGINS. PRIMULA VULGARIS IS A BIODIVERSITY INDICATOR, CHARACTERISTIC OF UNDISTURBED FLORA AND FOUND IN FIELD MARGINS AND WOODLANDS: ITS POPULATION HAS BEEN DECLINING FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WE CREATED A TEMPORAL MATRIX MODEL OF P. VULGARIS POPULATIONS ON FIELD MARGINS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE EFFECTS OF FIELD, FIELD MARGIN AND ROADSIDE MANAGEMENT BASED ON LITERATURE AND EXPERT KNOWLEDGE. WE THEN ANALYSED ITS SENSITIVITY TO DEMOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS BY COMPARING LAMBDA (GROWTH RATE) SENSITIVITY AND ELASTICITY. WE COMPARED THE MANAGEMENT PARAMETER EFFECT USING THE RELATIVE GROWTH RATE OF THE POPULATION AFTER 6 YEARS OF SIMULATION. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO BIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS SHOWED THE IMPORTANCE OF ADULT SURVIVAL AND SEED PRODUCTION AND GERMINATION. RESULTS SHOW THAT P. VULGARIS IS PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO BROAD-SPECTRUM HERBICIDES AND THAT OTHER MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES LIKE EARLY MOWING, SCYTHING AND SCRUB-KILLER (DILUTED BROAD-SPECTRUM HERBICIDE OR SPECIFIC HERBICIDE) ARE LESS AGGRESSIVE. OUR SIMULATIONS SHOW THAT MANAGEMENT OF CASH CROPS IN BRITTANY IS TOO AGGRESSIVE FOR P. VULGARIS POPULATIONS AND THAT 4–5 YEARS OF GRASSLAND IN THE ADJACENT FIELD ARE NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN POPULATIONS.","222","4","1002","1015","AGRICULTURE; BIODIVERSITY; CROPPING; FLORA; ECOLOGY; WOODLAND; GRASSLAND; PRIMULA VULGARIS; POPULATION; BIOLOGY","","","","","https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecomod/v222y2011i4p1002-1015.html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380010006344 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01000167","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.ECOLMODEL.2010.11.025","","10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2010.11.025","2018077030","","0","000-669-594-539-024; 007-243-303-723-240; 007-290-713-862-982; 009-344-777-389-833; 012-140-397-274-261; 014-193-777-320-583; 016-441-096-350-667; 016-530-076-334-39X; 018-069-577-454-103; 020-024-935-817-641; 020-713-595-267-906; 022-918-260-400-877; 024-571-906-248-900; 025-452-740-077-869; 025-983-895-963-761; 028-917-029-117-685; 031-862-039-493-29X; 032-092-568-630-622; 037-619-770-840-99X; 038-466-514-865-559; 039-453-492-999-196; 041-636-767-976-553; 042-168-379-149-822; 042-598-458-284-192; 046-767-300-153-803; 048-248-613-910-99X; 056-789-845-462-569; 060-212-024-680-436; 064-939-210-354-936; 065-571-211-857-221; 068-143-605-669-192; 069-606-851-845-280; 070-314-903-562-073; 072-381-259-408-94X; 073-723-668-372-363; 078-989-590-205-118; 083-296-610-777-228; 091-449-320-063-352; 099-519-954-014-909; 100-229-431-513-918; 103-822-141-108-70X; 108-184-303-981-308; 109-834-836-962-968; 111-133-295-313-438; 117-345-687-903-78X; 123-653-571-393-994; 130-341-110-693-83X; 130-698-554-759-854; 131-718-614-593-596; 133-744-688-564-298; 139-881-434-195-84X; 143-507-381-014-244; 150-312-221-768-673; 172-358-826-429-297; 174-286-544-519-158; 176-506-367-701-104; 178-411-469-458-660; 186-739-979-596-835; 188-468-956-254-948","0","A.

THE DESTRUCTION OF TRADITIONALLY MANAGED ORCHARDS, AN IMPORTANT BREEDING HABITAT IN CENTRAL EUROPE, IS A RELEVANT CAUSE. AN ADDITIONAL FACTOR FOR THE DECLINE OF THIS SPECIES COULD BE THE INTENSIFIED MANAGEMENT OF THE GROUND VEGETATION IN ORCHARDS THROUGH REDUCING FOOD AVAILABILITY AND LOWERING PREY DETECTABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY. IN THIS STUDY WE EXAMINED THE IMPORTANCE OF SURFACES WITH SPARSE VEGETATION FOR THE LOCATION OF REDSTART TERRITORIES AND FOR FORAGING. TO VALIDATE THE RESULTS OF THESE FIELD STUDIES WE MADE HABITAT-CHOICE EXPERIMENTS IN AVIARIES WITH CAPTIVE BIRDS. TERRITORIES OCCUPIED BY REDSTARTS IN ORCHARDS OF NORTHWESTERN SWITZERLAND CONTAINED A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PROPORTION OF SURFACES WITH SPARSE VEGETATION THAN UNOCCUPIED CONTROL SITES. REDSTARTS MADE ALMOST FIVE TIMES MORE HUNTING FLIGHTS INTO EXPERIMENTALLY ESTABLISHED RUDERAL VEGETATION STRIPS THAN INTO ADJACENT UNMOWN MEADOWS. NO DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED WHEN THE MEADOW WAS FRESHLY MOWN. VEGETATION HEIGHT AND THE PROPORTION OF OPEN GROUND SURFACE CORRECTLY PREDICTED THE VEGETATION TYPE FOR HUNTING IN 77% OF THE CASES. EXPERIMENTS IN AVIARIES OFFERING TWO TYPES OF SPARSE VEGETATION AND A DENSE MEADOW SUPPORTED THE RESULTS OF THE FIELD EXPERIMENTS. EVEN A FOUR-FOLD INCREASE OF THE FOOD ABUNDANCE IN THE MEADOW DID NOT LEAD TO A NOTICEABLE CHANGE IN PREFERENCE FOR THE SPARSE VEGETATION TYPES. FOR THE CONSERVATION OF THE COMMON REDSTART, NOT ONLY TRADITIONALLY MANAGED ORCHARDS WITH TALL TREES WITH CAVITIES SHOULD BE PRESERVED BUT ALSO AREAS WITH SPARSE VEGETATION SHOULD BE FAVORED.","151","2","297","307","FORAGING; RUDERAL SPECIES; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; VEGETATION (PATHOLOGY); REDSTART; VEGETATION TYPE; ORCHARD; PHOENICURUS PHOENICURUS","","","","","https://orgprints.org/id/eprint/16970/ https://doi.org/10.1007/s10336-009-0455-6 https://edoc.unibas.ch/20723/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10336-009-0455-6 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10336-009-0455-6/fulltext.html","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1007/S10336-009-0455-6","","10.1007/s10336-009-0455-6","1986897907","","0","002-900-720-944-007; 003-251-732-418-644; 006-845-725-778-120; 007-991-211-083-083; 012-891-865-787-699; 014-694-787-738-700; 016-421-756-148-512; 020-131-452-110-549; 023-103-648-255-011; 024-118-406-968-439; 026-466-247-941-215; 031-592-787-048-258; 045-075-296-764-754; 046-687-342-420-738; 049-771-162-087-705; 051-824-580-453-278; 052-350-677-816-754; 062-892-104-573-694; 064-524-534-627-895; 070-582-747-582-275; 071-245-262-326-969; 073-443-212-441-213; 081-749-104-701-059; 087-858-111-111-103; 090-925-313-312-769; 094-578-664-433-388; 107-532-685-702-969; 107-745-401-264-178; 143-174-585-408-496; 152-313-615-159-27X; 177-204-095-917-296; 197-392-866-862-614","34","NICOLAS MARTINEZ; LUKAS JENNI; ERIC WYSS; NIKLAUS ZBINDEN","JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY","JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY","","LENS",0,"MARTINEZ N, 2009, JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY","MARTINEZ N, 2009, JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY"

THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN N 2 EMISSION FROM 1994-1995 TO 2001-2003 CAN BE RELATED TO CHANGES IN MICROBIAL ACTIVITY DURING THE SUCCESSION OF THE PIONEER GREY ALDER STAND INTO A MORE STABLE MIXED FOREST COMMUNITY. DUE TO CO 2 FLUXES AND N 2 O FLUXES FROM SITES WITH ALTERED WATER REGIME, THE ESTIMATED GWP OF THE STUDIED RIPARIAN ALDER STANDS WAS RELATIVELY HIGH.

MORE THAN HALF OF SKYLARK TERRITORIES WERE IN AUTUMN-SOWN CEREALS, BUT DENSITIES WERE HIGHER IN SET-ASIDE AND SPRING-SOWN CROPS, WHILE A CONSERVATION GRASSLAND CUT FOR HAY IN LATE JULY HELD THE HIGHEST DENSITY. SKYLARKS DID NOT SWITCH TERRITORIES IN WINTER CEREALS FOR OTHER CROPS AS THE BREEDING SEASON PROGRESSED. WEAK PREFERENCES WERE FOUND FOR SPRING-SOWN CROPS AND WEAK AVOIDANCE OF AUTUMN-SOWN CROPS (I.E. THERE WERE FEWER TERRITORIES THAN EXPECTED FROM THE AREA UNDER AUTUMN-SOWN CROPS). SKYLARKS SHOWED PREFERENCES FOR SET-ASIDE AND CONSERVATION GRASSLAND BUT OTHER GRASSLAND WAS AVOIDED. SKYLARK NUMBERS WERE NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH HEDGEROW LENGTH WITHIN TETRADS. MOST YELLOW WAGTAILS NESTED IN SPRING-SOWN CROPS, ESPECIALLY POTATOES, FOR WHICH THERE WAS A STRONG PREFERENCE; MOST TERRITORIES WERE IN THE LARGEST FIELDS. MORE THAN 75% OF TERRITORIES OF TURTLE DOVE STREPTOPELIA TURTUR WERE ASSOCIATED WITH RESIDENTIAL AREAS, SCRUB AND WOODLAND, WITH HEDGES USED MUCH LESS OFTEN THAN EXPECTED FROM THEIR OCCURRENCE.

HEDGES AND FOREST REMNANTS MAY MITIGATE BIODIVERSITY LOSS BY ENHANCING LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY AND PROVIDING HABITAT TO A WIDE RANGE OF SPECIES, INCLUDING BIRDS. HOWEVER, NEST PREDATION, THE MAJOR CAUSE OF REPRODUCTIVE FAILURE OF BIRDS, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE HIGHER IN FOREST EDGES THAN IN FOREST INTERIORS. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT (CONFIGURATION) OF HEDGES AFFECTS THE AVIAN NEST PREDATION. WE PERFORMED AN EXPERIMENT WITH ARTIFICIAL GROUND AND ELEVATED NESTS (RESEMBLING YELLOWHAMMER AND WHITETHROAT NESTS) BAITED WITH QUAIL AND PLASTICINE EGGS. NESTS WERE PLACED IN THREE HABITAT TYPES WITH DIFFERENT DEGREES OF ISOLATION FROM FORESTS: FOREST EDGES, HEDGES CONNECTED TO FORESTS AND HEDGES ISOLATED FROM FORESTS. NEST PREDATION WAS HIGHEST IN FOREST EDGES, LOWEST IN HEDGES CONNECTED TO FORESTS AND INTERMEDIATE IN ISOLATED HEDGES. IN THE EARLY BREEDING SEASON, WE FOUND SIMILAR NEST PREDATION ON GROUND AND ELEVATED NESTS, BUT IN THE LATE BREEDING SEASON NEST PREDATION WAS HIGHER ON GROUND NESTS THAN ON ELEVATED NESTS. SMALL MAMMALS WERE THE MAIN PREDATORS OF GROUND NESTS AND APPEARED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCREASE IN PREDATION FROM EARLY TO LATE BREEDING SEASON, WHEREAS THE ELEVATED NESTS WERE MAINLY DEPREDATED BY SMALL BIRDS AND SMALL MAMMALS. HIGH PREDATION PRESSURE AT FOREST EDGES WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY BOTH FOREST AND OPEN-LANDSCAPE PREDATORS. THE INFLUENCE OF FOREST PREDATORS MAY BE LOWER AT HEDGES, LEADING TO LOWER PREDATION PRESSURE THAN IN FOREST EDGES. HIGHER PREDATION PRESSURE IN ISOLATED THAN CONNECTED HEDGES MIGHT BE AN EFFECT OF CONCENTRATION OF PREDATORS IN THESE ISOLATED HABITATS. WE CONCLUDE THAT LANDSCAPE CONFIGURATION OF HEDGES IS IMPORTANT IN NEST PREDATION, WITH CONNECTED HEDGES ALLOWING HIGHER SURVIVAL THAN ISOLATED HEDGES AND FOREST EDGES.","45","45","50","56","SEASONAL BREEDER; BIODIVERSITY; NEST; HABITAT; PREDATION; ECOLOGY; YELLOWHAMMER; PLASTICINE; BIRD NEST; BIOLOGY","","","","","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1146609X12001105 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/1116869 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AcO....45...50L/abstract https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1146609X12001105 https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-253e3029-ede2-30a5-bd9b-43ba007cb568","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.ACTAO.2012.08.008","","10.1016/j.actao.2012.08.008","1983405300","","0","001-626-811-932-241; 008-225-619-668-580; 012-390-404-634-862; 017-193-500-641-586; 019-860-110-110-463; 019-925-489-194-685; 020-938-492-722-870; 022-680-725-650-829; 026-766-790-225-506; 030-831-977-852-027; 031-592-787-048-258; 032-590-712-791-490; 039-385-564-295-146; 041-679-397-425-833; 041-728-890-038-763; 047-000-620-546-182; 051-149-708-871-297; 051-750-139-155-449; 054-496-434-177-85X; 059-796-555-907-739; 060-340-763-373-559; 066-388-810-753-310; 067-026-574-979-251; 068-172-042-516-91X; 068-452-604-669-157; 071-604-253-914-381; 074-924-636-701-465; 075-168-083-087-797; 075-762-658-321-41X; 079-554-414-954-690; 082-338-894-351-339; 082-484-240-847-058; 083-616-222-476-247; 088-531-905-159-215; 089-945-115-385-599; 090-638-399-212-299; 092-134-681-380-206; 099-605-273-789-62X; 102-181-065-176-319; 106-081-154-740-548; 111-055-494-060-639; 113-742-530-077-516; 117-006-806-257-463; 120-467-101-353-965; 125-870-205-356-222; 127-287-507-350-445; 136-846-670-164-129; 143-250-679-860-16X; 152-072-465-980-93X; 156-624-196-949-616; 168-314-870-071-254; 169-088-517-056-428","28","MARTIN LUDWIG; HELLA SCHLINKERT; ANDREA HOLZSCHUH; CHRISTINA FISCHER; CHRISTOPH SCHERBER; ALFRÉD TRNKA; TEJA TSCHARNTKE; PÉTER BATÁRY","ACTA OECOLOGICA","ACTA OECOLOGICA","","LENS",0,"LUDWIG M, 2012, ACTA OECOLOGICA","LUDWIG M, 2012, ACTA OECOLOGICA"

THESE TREATMENTS WERE RANDOMISED WITHIN SIX COMPLETE BLOCKS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD'S FARM AT WYTHAM. CUTTING VEGETATION HAD AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT ON NUMBER OF L. TENUIS IN BOTH SPRING AND SUMMER. CUTTING MARGINS IN SUMMER HAD A MORE PERSISTENT EFFECT ON POPULATIONS OF L. TENUIS THAN DID CUTTING MARGINS IN SPRING. THE EFFECT OF CUTTING WAS NOT MITIGATED BY LEAVING CUT VEGETATION IN SITU, BUT NO CUTTING ENSURED HIGHER NUMBER OF L.

SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER SPIDERS WERE FOUND IN JULY AND SEPTEMBER PLOTS WHICH HAD BEEN SPRAYED WITH HERBICIDE IN LATE JUNE/EARLY JULY. HOWEVER, SPIDER NUMBERS WERE NOT AFFECTED BY GLYPHOSATE APPLICATION WHEN SAMPLES WERE TAKEN NEARLY A YEAR LATER.

INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FLESHY-FRUITED PLANTS AND FRUGIVOROUS BIRDS ARE HIGHLY SEASONAL IN TEMPERATE ECOSYSTEMS. NEVERTHELESS, COMBINED EFFECTS OF LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION AND SEASONAL VARIATION ON PLANT-FRUGIVORE INTERACTIONS HAVE NEVER BEEN ASSESSED FROM A NETWORK PERSPECTIVE. HERE, WE PRESENT THE FIRST STUDY THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY INVESTIGATES EFFECTS OF LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION AND SEASONAL VARIATION ON PLANT-FRUGIVORE INTERACTIONS AND ON FUNCTIONAL AND INTERACTION DIVERSITY OF PLANT-FRUGIVORE NETWORKS. WE RECORDED VISITATION RATES OF 39 FRUGIVOROUS BIRD SPECIES TO 28 FRUITING-PLANT SPECIES IN CENTRAL GERMANY FROM EARLY SUMMER TO LATE AUTUMN IN HEDGEROWS WITHIN THREE LANDSCAPE TYPES ARRANGED ALONG A GRADIENT OF DECREASING ANTHROPOGENIC MODIFICATION AND INCREASING STRUCTURAL DIVERSITY (I.E., FARMLAND, ORCHARD, FOREST EDGE). WE ANALYZED HOW SPECIES RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE, AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, AS WELL AS FUNCTIONAL AND INTERACTION DIVERSITY OF FRUITING PLANTS AND FRUGIVOROUS BIRDS CHANGED WITH LANDSCAPE TYPE, FRUIT AVAILABILITY, AND SEASON. WE FOUND THAT VISITATION RATES OF FRUGIVOROUS BIRDS WERE LOWER IN FARMLAND, BUT ONLY IN SUMMER. IN AUTUMN, VISITATION RATES WERE SIMILAR IN ALL LANDSCAPE TYPES AND STRONGLY INCREASED WITH INCREASING LOCAL FRUIT AVAILABILITY. THE FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY OF FRUITS AND FRUGIVOROUS BIRDS AND THEIR INTERACTION DIVERSITY REMAINED SURPRISINGLY CONSTANT IN ALL LANDSCAPE TYPES. DUE TO SEASONAL CHANGES IN COMMUNITIES OF FRUITING PLANTS AND FRUGIVOROUS BIRDS, FUNCTIONAL DISPERSION OF FRUITING PLANTS WAS LOWER IN AUTUMN THAN IN SUMMER, WHEREAS FUNCTIONAL RICHNESS AND DISPERSION OF FRUGIVOROUS BIRDS WAS HIGHER IN AUTUMN THAN IN SUMMER. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT SEASONAL CHANGES IN FRUIT AVAILABILITY INFLUENCE THE ABUNDANCE OF FRUGIVOROUS BIRDS ALONG GRADIENTS OF STRUCTURAL DIVERSITY AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE. ALTHOUGH SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS INFLUENCED THE FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY OF AVIAN FRUGIVORE COMMUNITIES, WE FOUND CONSTANT INTERACTION DIVERSITY OF PLANT-FRUGIVORE NETWORKS IN SPACE AND TIME, PROBABLY DUE TO THE FUNCTIONAL REDUNDANCY OF FRUGIVOROUS BIRDS. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE A HIGH ROBUSTNESS OF AVIAN FRUGIVORY TO MODERATE LEVELS OF HUMAN-INDUCED LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION IN TEMPERATE ECOSYSTEMS AND CALL FOR STUDIES TESTING THE GENERALITY OF THESE FINDINGS FOR ULTIMATE AVIAN SEED DISPERSAL FUNCTIONS.","94","6","1296","1306","ECOSYSTEM; BIODIVERSITY; FRUGIVORE; SEED DISPERSAL; ECOLOGY; ORCHARD; SPECIES RICHNESS; ABUNDANCE (ECOLOGY); TEMPERATE CLIMATE; BIOLOGY","","ANIMALS; BIRDS/PHYSIOLOGY; DEMOGRAPHY; ECOSYSTEM; FEEDING BEHAVIOR/PHYSIOLOGY; FRUIT; GERMANY; TIME FACTORS","","","https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/12-1213.1 https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:52a5e89 http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/12-1213.1 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/12-1213.1/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23923493 https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1890/12-1213.1","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1890/12-1213.1","23923493","10.1890/12-1213.1","2043175460","","0","002-155-103-652-773; 004-073-731-578-889; 004-951-469-878-072; 006-353-514-480-649; 006-651-756-625-332; 007-661-571-004-201; 008-225-619-668-580; 011-193-132-664-152; 012-662-529-735-954; 012-801-000-483-803; 013-267-136-894-344; 013-576-433-554-839; 013-699-880-107-301; 015-335-321-886-527; 029-136-104-232-881; 032-452-486-736-649; 033-765-534-094-227; 034-166-519-290-467; 037-751-281-974-653; 043-334-181-578-717; 043-686-913-320-033; 043-811-590-231-051; 045-823-211-221-277; 049-422-617-755-023; 051-078-158-132-063; 051-545-859-164-711; 051-867-920-489-999; 054-948-494-071-795; 058-715-755-791-116; 062-235-971-721-755; 069-654-484-205-375; 071-307-992-550-410; 086-626-249-909-151; 087-205-024-828-239; 090-053-282-490-718; 099-595-251-946-405; 111-617-655-286-770; 116-926-790-022-402; 125-280-614-407-73X; 125-307-019-970-496; 128-141-135-206-235; 129-590-087-338-777; 132-266-263-956-843; 158-880-519-987-365","52","MICHAELA PLEIN; LAURA LÄNGSFELD; EIKE LENA NEUSCHULZ; CHRISTINA SCHULTHEIß; LILI INGMANN; TILL TÖPFER; KATRIN BÖHNING-GAESE; MATTHIAS SCHLEUNING","ECOLOGY","ECOLOGY","","LENS",0,"PLEIN M, 2013, ECOLOGY","PLEIN M, 2013, ECOLOGY"

NITRATE–N (NO3–N) AND AMMONIA–N (NH3–N) CONCENTRATIONS IN SUBSURFACE LATERAL FLOW WERE MEASURED AT 1 M DEPTH IN A BS SYSTEM CONSISTING OF FIVE TREATMENTS: G: STRIP OF GRASS (FESCUE ARUNDINACEA); GS: STRIP OF GRASS AND LINE OF NATIVE SHRUBS (FUCHSIA MAGELLANICA); GST1: STRIP OF GRASS, LINE OF SHRUBS AND LINE OF NATIVE TREES 1 (LUMA CHEQUEN); GST2: STRIP OF GRASS, LINE OF SHRUBS AND LINE OF NATIVE TREES 2 (DRIMYS WINTERI); AND C: BARE SOIL AS CONTROL. WATER SAMPLES FOR THE NO3–N AND NH3–N MEASUREMENTS WERE COLLECTED BETWEEN JUNE 2012 AND AUGUST 2014 IN OBSERVATION WELLS LOCATED AT THE INLET (INPUT) AND OUTLET (OUTPUT) OF EACH TREATMENT. THE ANALYSES SHOWED THAT VEGETATED BS HAD NO3–N REMOVAL EFFICIENCY RANGING FROM 33 TO 67 % (MEAN 52 %), WITH THE G TREATMENT SHOWING THE BEST PERFORMANCE IN REDUCING NO3–N CONCENTRATIONS IN SUBSURFACE LATERAL FLOW.

HERE, WE DESCRIBE THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST COMPONENT OF LOTIC INTERSITE NITROGEN EXPERIMENT, PHASE II (LINX II) TO EXAMINE HOW LAND-USE SETTING INFLUENCES FATES OF NO3− IN STREAMS. WE USED 24 H RELEASES OF A STABLE ISOTOPE TRACER (15NO3-N) IN NINE STREAMS FLOWING THROUGH FOREST, AGRICULTURAL, AND URBAN LAND USES TO QUANTIFY NO3− UPTAKE PROCESSES. NO3− UPTAKE LENGTHS VARIED TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE (24–4247 M), WITH UPTAKE RATES (6.5–158.1 MG NO3-N M−2 DAY−1) AND UPTAKE VELOCITIES (0.1–2.3 MM MIN−1) FALLING WITHIN THE RANGES MEASURED IN OTHER LINX II REGIONS. DENITRIFICATION REMOVED 0–7% OF ADDED TRACER FROM OUR STREAMS. IN FOREST STREAMS, 60.4 TO 77.0% OF THE ISOTOPE TRACER WAS EXPORTED DOWNSTREAM AS NO3−, WITH 8.0 TO 14.8% STORED IN WOOD BIOFILMS, EPILITHON, FINE BENTHIC ORGANIC MATTER, AND BRYOPHYTES. AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN STREAMS WITH STREAMSIDE FOREST BUFFERS DISPLAYED HYDROLOGIC EXPORT AND ORGANIC MATTER STORAGE OF TRACER SIMILAR TO THOSE MEASURED IN FOREST STREAMS. IN AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN STREAMS WITH A PARTIAL OR NO RIPARIAN BUFFER, LESS THAN 1 TO 75% OF THE TRACER WAS EXPORTED DOWNSTREAM; MUCH OF THE REMAINDER WAS TAKEN UP AND STORED IN AUTOTROPHIC ORGANIC MATTER COMPONENTS WITH SHORT N TURNOVER TIMES.

THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PASTURE BUFFER LENGTHS (0, 2, AND 5 M) ON SEDIMENT AND CHEMICAL TRANSPORT FROM TWO PASTURE SITES NEAR WIVENHOE DAM, THE MAIN WATER RESERVOIR FOR BRISBANE CITY. SIMULATED RAINFALL (100 MM/H) WAS APPLIED TO 18 PLOTS ON PASTURE SITES AFTER THEY WERE BURNT, AND INSOLUBLE AND SOLUBLE COMPONENTS WERE MEASURED IN THE RUNOFF. MOST ERODED SEDIMENT/ORGANIC DEBRIS ACCUMULATED AGAINST THE FIRST ROW OF THE GRASS BUFFER STRIPS OR WAS DEPOSITED IN THE UPSLOPE BACKWATER REGION. BUFFER LENGTH HAD LITTLE IMPACT ON THE RUNOFF CONCENTRATIONS OF NO3– AND NO2– (NOX), TOTAL KJELDAHL NITROGEN, AND TOTAL NITROGEN FROM THE 5-M-LENGTH UPSLOPE PLOTS BUT WAS SIGNIFICANT FOR SEDIMENT LOSS RATE, FILTERABLE REACTIVE PHOSPHATE, AMMONIUM, AND TOTAL AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON. PASTURE TYPE WAS SIGNIFICANT FOR NOX, AMMONIUM, SEDIMENT LOSS RATE, AND TOTAL ORGANIC CARBON ONLY.

THE WORK LED US TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS: HONEYDEW OF CABBAGE APHIDS ENHANCES THE SURVIVAL OF THE HOVERFLY EPISYRPHUS BALTEATUS, AND CAN BE AN IMPORTANT FOOD SOURCE WHEN THE SYRPHIDS ARE SEARCHING WITHIN THE CROP FOR OVIPOSITION SITES. SYRPHIDS CAN ONLY REPRODUCE WHEN POLLEN IS AVAILABLE AS WELL. FEEDING ON POLLEN AND NECTAR DURING THE PRE-OVIPOSITIONAL PERIOD ALLOWS THE FEMALES TO PRODUCE EGGS FOR A WEEK THEREAFTER, EVEN WHEN FLOWERS ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE. THIS SHOWS THAT THEY CAN STORE THEIR FOOD RESERVES FOR SEVERAL DAYS. FEMALE SYRPHIDS PROBABLY FOCUSES ON FLOWER FORAGING DURING THE FIRST WEEK AFTER EMERGENCE, BEFORE SWITCHING TO SEARCHING FOR APHIDS AND OVIPOSITION SITES (IN THE CROP). THEREAFTER, THE SYRPHID WILL HAVE TO TRAVEL AGAIN BETWEEN FLORAL PATCHES AND APHID PATCHES TO MAINTAIN EGG MATURATION. CAGE EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT THE SYRPHID E. BALTEATUS CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE PREDATOR OF CABBAGE APHIDS ON BRUSSELS SPROUTS. THE RESURGENCE OF THE CABBAGE APHIDS IN AUTUMN, WHEN NATURAL ENEMIES SUCH AS SYRPHIDS VIRTUALLY DISAPPEAR, SUGGESTS THAT THESE NATURAL ENEMIES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN KEEPING THE APHIDS UNDER CONTROL DURING SUMMER. SYRPHIDS ARE STIMULATED IN THE CROP BY THE VICINITY OF FLOWERING PLANTS LIKE BUCKWHEAT AND CORNFLOWER. DURING SUMMER THE DIFFERENCES IN SYRPHID DENSITIES WERE NOT REFLECTED IN APHID POPULATION LEVELS. POSSIBLY, NATURAL ENEMIES THAT ARE LESS DEPENDENT ON FLORAL RESOURCES, SUCH AS PARASITOIDS, COMPENSATE FOR THE SMALL SCALE DIFFERENCES IN SYRPHID PREDATOR DENSITY.","","","","","BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL; NECTAR; HORTICULTURE; FORAGING; APHID; EPISYRPHUS BALTEATUS; HONEYDEW; HOVERFLY; POPULATION; BIOLOGY","","","","","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Felix_Waeckers/publication/228480150_The_impact_of_floral_resources_on_syrphid_performance_and_cabbage_aphid_biological_control/links/00b7d523536bfa4774000000.pdf?disableCoverPage=true https://www.uva.nl/binaries/content/documents/personalpages/r/i/p.c.j.vanrijn/en/tab-four/tab-four/cpitem%5B8%5D/asset?1355373685569 https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/9198/","HTTPS://EPRINTS.LANCS.AC.UK/ID/EPRINT/9198/","","","125176218","","0","007-928-236-980-870; 012-466-311-051-172; 172-012-594-087-145; 194-595-863-937-394","25","PAUL C.

TO DETERMINE THE COST OF THE APPROACHES, SIMPLE FINANCIAL SPREADSHEET MODELS WERE CONSTRUCTED AT BOTH FARM AND REGIONAL LEVELS. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT CROP AREAS, CROP ROTATION MARGINS PER HECTARE WERE CALCULATED TO REFLECT THE COSTS OF CROP ESTABLISHMENT, FERTILISER AND AGRO-CHEMICAL APPLICATIONS, HARVESTING, AND THE ASSOCIATED LABOUR AND MACHINERY COSTS. VARIABLE AND OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH MITIGATION OPTION WERE THEN INCORPORATED TO DEMONSTRATE THE IMPACT ON THE RELEVANT CROP ENTERPRISE AND CROP ROTATION MARGINS. THESE COSTS WERE THEN COMPARED TO RUNOFF, SEDIMENT AND PHOSPHORUS LOSS DATA OBTAINED FROM MONITORING HILLSLOPE-LENGTH SCALE FIELD PLOTS. EACH OF THE MITIGATION OPTIONS EXPLORED IN THIS STUDY HAD POTENTIAL FOR REDUCING SEDIMENT AND PHOSPHORUS LOSSES FROM ARABLE LAND UNDER CEREAL CROPS. SEDIMENT LOSSES WERE REDUCED FROM BETWEEN 9 KG HA−1 TO AS MUCH AS 4780 KG HA−1 WITH A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN PHOSPHORUS LOSS FROM 0.03 KG HA−1 TO 2.89 KG HA−1. IN PERCENTAGE TERMS REDUCTIONS OF PHOSPHORUS WERE BETWEEN 9% AND 99%. IMPACTS ON CROP ROTATION MARGINS ALSO VARIED. MINIMUM TILLAGE RESULTED IN COST SAVINGS (UP TO £50 HA−1) WHILST OTHER OPTIONS SHOWED INCREASED COSTS (UP TO £19 HA−1 FOR STRAW RESIDUE INCORPORATION). OVERALL, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT EACH OF THE OPTIONS HAS POTENTIAL FOR ON-FARM IMPLEMENTATION. HOWEVER, TRAMLINE MANAGEMENT APPEARED TO HAVE THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR REDUCING RUNOFF, SEDIMENT, AND PHOSPHORUS LOSSES FROM ARABLE LAND (BETWEEN 69% AND 99%) AND IS LIKELY TO BE CONSIDERED COST-EFFECTIVE WITH ONLY A SMALL ADDITIONAL COST OF £2–4 HA−1, ALTHOUGH FURTHER WORK IS NEEDED TO EVALUATE ALTERNATIVE TRAMLINE MANAGEMENT METHODS. TRAMLINE MANAGEMENT IS ALSO THE ONLY OPTION NOT INCORPORATED WITHIN CURRENT POLICY MECHANISMS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCING SOIL EROSION AND PHOSPHORUS LOSS AND IN LIGHT OF ITS POTENTIAL IS AN APPROACH THAT SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED ONCE FURTHER EVIDENCE IS AVAILABLE.","30","1","234","242","MINIMUM TILLAGE; CROP ROTATION; HECTARE; STRAW; SEDIMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SURFACE RUNOFF; PHOSPHORUS; ARABLE LAND; ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837712000610 https://core.ac.uk/display/42146651 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=4324775 http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/27914/ https://researcharchive.lincoln.ac.nz/handle/10182/8586 https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/53872/","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2012.03.027","","10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.03.027","2063648080","","0","001-083-070-974-891; 002-289-806-087-524; 003-582-932-697-656; 004-424-923-330-070; 006-091-377-484-346; 011-953-794-268-094; 012-270-562-930-580; 015-136-520-607-410; 017-803-554-750-37X; 020-755-871-380-59X; 021-064-526-292-381; 023-833-493-505-921; 030-665-886-156-332; 032-966-313-575-494; 035-943-990-381-491; 038-154-911-202-449; 054-469-018-454-56X; 061-403-908-682-398; 068-553-625-306-77X; 068-843-316-009-830; 076-730-383-475-785; 076-779-230-104-235; 076-914-949-136-341; 080-581-329-922-191; 090-006-034-117-891; 093-710-676-627-680; 118-806-069-141-947; 121-765-856-530-837; 132-902-790-271-293; 134-261-193-693-91X; 134-423-481-321-861; 138-651-648-737-878; 142-231-073-413-920; 153-368-929-556-854; 160-543-263-675-951; 168-181-565-322-997; 168-222-853-197-586","20","ALISON BAILEY; C.

SOME WILDFLOWER STRIPS ARE MOWN OR HARROWED TO MAINTAIN SPECIES DIVERSITY. MANAGEMENT AND ASSOCIATED CHANGES IN VEGETATION STRUCTURE MAY AFFECT SEED PREDATION WHICH IS A KEY FACTOR IN PLANT POPULATION DYNAMICS. THE AIMS OF THE PRESENT WORK WERE TO (1) ASSESS THE MAGNITUDE AND SPATIAL VARIATION OF SEED PREDATION IN MANAGED WILDFLOWER STRIPS, (2) IDENTIFY THE RESPONSIBLE SEED PREDATORS, AND (3) INVESTIGATE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SEED SPECIES. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN FIVE WILDFLOWER STRIPS IN NORTHERN SWITZERLAND; THE TREATMENTS WERE FALLOW, MOWING AND HARROWING IN WINTER. PERMANENT PLOTS WERE ESTABLISHED TO INVESTIGATE THE VEGETATION STRUCTURE, SEED REMOVAL FROM SELECTIVELY ACCESSIBLE DISHES, AND RODENT ABUNDANCE IN LIFE TRAPS. SEEDS OF THREE ARABLE WEEDS WERE OFFERED WHICH ARE USED IN WILDFLOWER SEED MIXTURES ( AGROSTEMMA GITHAGO , CAMELINA SATIVA , CENTAUREA CYANUS ). SEEDS OF PRUNUS AVIUM WERE CHOSEN TO INVESTIGATE EXCLUSIVELY PREDATION BY RODENTS. LOSSES OF SEED WERE RECORDED FOR ONE WEEK IN FOUR EXPERIMENTS FROM JUNE TO AUGUST. MANAGEMENT HAD ONLY A MODERATE EFFECT ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE VEGETATION IN SUMMER. FALLOW AND MOWN PLOTS WERE SIMILAR AND HAD A TALL AND DENSE CANOPY, WHEREAS PLANT COVER WAS SPARSE IN THE HARROWED PLOTS. A TOTAL OF 101 PLANT SPECIES OCCURRED, ALTHOUGH MOST PLOTS WERE DOMINATED BY TANACETUM VULGARE AND ELYMUS REPENS . IN THE HARROWED PLOTS ANNUAL SPECIES WERE MORE ABUNDANT (E.G., C. CYANUS , CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA , PAPAVER RHOEAS ). THE SELECTIVELY ACCESSIBLE DISHES REVEALED THAT RODENTS AND SLUGS WERE THE MAIN SEED PREDATORS. PREDATION BY INSECTS AND PASSERINE BIRDS WAS NEGLIGIBLE. RODENTS STRONGLY PREFERRED C. CYANUS , WHEREAS SLUGS DESTROYED MOST SEED OF C. SATIVA . AFTER ONE WEEK SEED LOSSES AMOUNTED TO 43–51% IN C. SATIVA , 23–25% C. CYANUS AND 10–12% A. GITHAGO . THE RANK ORDER OF THE SPECIES WAS SIMILAR FOR THE THREE MANAGEMENT TREATMENTS AND BOTH STUDY PERIODS. PREDATION OF C. SATIVA WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN THE HARROWED PLOTS, WHEREAS THE LOSSES OF C. CYANUS WERE INDEPENDENT OF MANAGEMENT. LIVE-TRAPPING SUGGESTED THAT APODEMUS FLAVICOLLIS AND A. SYLVATICUS WERE MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR SEED PREDATION OF C. CYANUS ; MICROTUS ARVALIS AVOIDED HARROWED PLOTS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT ONLY HARROWING SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS THE VEGETATION STRUCTURE OF WILDFLOWER STRIPS AND REDUCES SEED LOSSES, THAT SEED PREDATION BY RODENTS AND SLUGS IS HIGH, AND THAT ARABLE WEEDS ARE AFFECTED TO A DIFFERENT EXTENT.","83","3","285","296","PREDATION; PLANT COVER; CYANUS; WEED; WILDFLOWER; SEED PREDATION; ELYMUS REPENS; CENTAUREA CYANUS; BOTANY; AGRONOMY; BIOLOGY","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880900002024","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/S0167-8809(00)00202-4","","10.1016/s0167-8809(00)00202-4","2022783191","","0","004-010-787-386-28X; 004-237-567-877-147; 005-833-582-864-691; 007-635-301-988-969; 010-009-952-174-424; 010-945-646-716-071; 013-801-483-768-42X; 014-341-100-117-630; 015-479-304-278-098; 016-573-648-664-125; 017-301-798-471-019; 020-394-955-680-687; 020-974-401-450-004; 021-026-931-239-376; 024-483-150-779-700; 024-756-699-374-795; 026-937-906-032-356; 027-974-001-277-77X; 030-145-510-063-139; 030-207-952-990-125; 030-711-173-650-933; 031-905-111-001-075; 033-688-788-578-102; 033-718-547-875-987; 038-684-585-588-865; 039-936-551-657-61X; 041-686-795-355-194; 043-500-631-668-754; 045-978-368-270-313; 048-529-956-384-881; 049-088-413-362-630; 050-559-473-120-629; 052-865-416-956-188; 053-551-700-281-485; 057-655-484-758-059; 058-207-004-241-606; 060-813-541-948-641; 063-936-679-622-512; 066-897-512-647-945; 067-996-338-341-210; 072-075-320-524-259; 072-817-046-222-302; 075-746-480-320-013; 076-016-447-384-973; 080-490-412-008-807; 086-419-085-554-996; 087-185-351-771-625; 087-988-213-080-905; 091-459-193-083-754; 098-116-028-219-152; 106-788-971-884-663; 107-018-658-803-543; 107-745-401-264-178; 108-735-662-799-143; 108-827-991-488-483; 114-480-653-531-829; 117-669-932-807-814; 125-995-631-935-63X; 140-037-889-581-116; 140-815-034-308-497; 142-638-428-622-145; 144-405-102-331-626; 156-060-321-738-674; 165-804-108-473-473; 170-044-763-432-805; 174-054-328-942-709; 175-327-710-689-529; 186-370-719-055-445; 198-423-264-986-893","42","JOHANNES KOLLMANN; SERAINA BASSIN","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","","LENS",0,"KOLLMANN J, 2001, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","KOLLMANN J, 2001, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT"

AS A RESULT, MOST HEADWATER STREAMS SHOW STRUCTURALLY DEGRADED CHANNELS, LACKING RIPARIAN BUFFER ZONES, WHICH ARE HEAVILY LOADED WITH NUTRIENTS FROM THE SURROUNDING CROP FIELDS. THE PRESENT STUDY EXAMINES WHETHER LONGITUDINALLY RESTRICTED RIPARIAN FOREST BUFFERS CAN ENHANCE THE IN-STREAM NUTRIENT RETENTION IN NUTRIENT-ENRICHED HEADWATER STREAMS. WE ESTIMATED NUTRIENT UPTAKE FROM PAIRWISE, SHORTTERM ADDITION EXPERIMENTS WITH 15NH4, NH4, PO4, AND NACL WITHIN REACHES WITH RIPARIAN FOREST BUFFERS (RFB) AND DEGRADED REACHES (DEG) OF THE SAME STREAMS. RIPARIAN FOREST BUFFERS ORIGINATED FROM THE CONSERVATION OF THE PRISTINE VEGETATION OR FROM RESTORATION MEASURES. HYDROLOGIC RETENTION WAS CALCULATED WITH THE MODEL OTIS-P ON THE BASIS OF CONDUCTIVITY BREAKTHROUGH CURVES FROM THE SALT INJECTIONS. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SURFACE TRANSIENT STORAGE WAS REVEALED IN PRISTINE AND RESTORED RFB REACHES COMPARED WITH DEG REACHES DUE TO THE LONGITUDINAL STEPPOOL PATTERN AND THE FREQUENT OCCURRENCE OF WOODY DEBRIS ON THE CHANNEL BED. AMMONIUM UPTAKE LENGTHS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER IN RFB REACHES THAN IN DEG REACHES, RESULTING FROM THE HIGHER HYDROLOGIC RETENTION. UPTAKE VELOCITIES DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN RFB AND DEG REACHES, INDICATING THAT RIPARIAN FOREST BUFFERS DID NOT AFFECT THE BIOCHEMICAL NUTRIENT DEMAND. UPTAKE OF 15NH4 WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY AUTOTROPHS. NET PO4 UPTAKE WAS NOT AFFECTED BY RIPARIAN FOREST BUFFERS. THE STUDY SHOWS THAT THE PHYSICAL AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL EFFECTS OF RIPARIAN FOREST BUFFERS ON THE IN-STREAM NUTRIENT RETENTION ARE LIMITED IN THE CASE OF HIGHLY EUTROPHIC STREAMS.","41","2","373","379","RIPARIAN ZONE; NUTRIENT; RIPARIAN FOREST; VEGETATION; EUTROPHICATION; RIPARIAN BUFFER; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; STREAMS; BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLE","","AGRICULTURE/METHODS; CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES/METHODS; FERTILIZERS/ANALYSIS; RIVERS/CHEMISTRY; TIME FACTORS; TREES","FERTILIZERS","EUROPEAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT FUND; EUROPEAN-TERRITORIAL-COOPERATION AUSTRIA-CZECH REPUBLIC; GOVERNMENT OF LOWER AUSTRIA; AUSTRIAN MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT","https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2134/jeq2010.0436 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22370399 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2134/jeq2010.0436 https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/pdfs/41/2/373 https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:321107 http://core.ac.uk/display/19490302","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.2134/JEQ2010.0436","22370399","10.2134/jeq2010.0436","2066115770","","0","001-785-297-014-015; 003-006-911-336-442; 005-367-762-394-433; 014-523-213-915-564; 015-031-207-682-544; 015-290-312-918-180; 016-097-351-692-542; 020-821-795-318-083; 021-295-006-788-082; 028-843-468-950-477; 029-491-286-007-883; 031-938-120-755-857; 032-329-555-105-303; 035-423-766-959-157; 055-190-617-488-049; 056-016-522-406-162; 073-430-824-144-233; 077-873-845-369-202; 104-310-637-590-138; 110-195-458-330-169; 111-765-441-561-743; 112-120-608-546-683; 128-897-191-630-604; 131-445-608-802-012; 144-647-630-481-945; 146-606-352-041-123; 168-228-690-607-508; 169-607-559-923-667; 184-635-815-001-277; 186-231-509-533-744; 193-242-118-369-606","34","GABRIELE WEIGELHOFER; JENNIFER FUCHSBERGER; BERNADETTE TEUFL; NINA WELTI; THOMAS HEIN","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY","","LENS",0,"WEIGELHOFER G, 2012, JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY","WEIGELHOFER G, 2012, JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY"

A CRITICAL WINDSPEED IS USED TO REPRESENT THE SENSITIVITY OF EACH OBJECT. WINDSPEEDS GREATER THAN THIS VALUE ARE CONSIDERED DAMAGING. A DIMENSIONLESS PROTECTION INDEX IS DEFINED TO EVALUATE WINDBREAK EFFICIENCY. THE MAXIMUM INDEX VALUE IS 1 FOR THE HIGHEST PROTECTION, AND THE INDEX IS NEGATIVE WHEN SHELTERED WINDSPEED IS GREATER THAN THE CRITICAL WINDSPEED. THIS INDEX CAN BE COMPARED, SUMMED, AND AVERAGED ACROSS DIFFERENT WINDBREAKS, OBJECTS, AND LEEWARD LOCATIONS. A SAMPLE OF CRITICAL WINDSPEED VALUES WAS COMPILED FROM THE LITERATURE.

THE NEED FOR MITIGATION MEASURES WAS INVESTIGATED AT 10 STREAM SITES WITHIN AN INTENSIVELY USED ARABLE REGION IN CENTRAL GERMANY BY CHARACTERIZING PESTICIDE EXPOSURE FOLLOWING EDGE-OF-FIELD RUNOFF AND EFFECTS ON THE AQUATIC MACROINVERTEBRATES. MOREOVER, THE INFLUENCE OF RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIP WIDTH (AS A MITIGATION MEASURE) AT THE SAMPLING SITES WAS CONSIDERED. GENERALLY, INVERTEBRATE FAUNA WAS DOMINATED BY PESTICIDE-TOLERANT SPECIES, SUGGESTING A HIGH PESTICIDE EXPOSURE AT ALMOST ALL SITES. THIS RESULT IS ALSO REFLECTED BY THE ELEVATED LEVELS OF SUSPENDED PARTICLE CONTAMINATION IN TERMS OF TOXIC UNITS (LOGTUMAX > −2), CORRESPONDING TO ONE-HUNDREDTH OF THE MEDIAN LETHAL CONCENTRATION (LC50) TO DAPHNIA MAGNA. AT TWO SITES THAT RECEIVED HIGH AQUEOUS-PHASE ENTRIES OF THE PYRETHROID LAMBDA-CYHALOTHRIN (LOGTUMAX > −0.6), THE ABUNDANCE AND NUMBER OF SENSITIVE SPECIES IN TERMS OF THE SPECIES AT RISK INDEX DECREASED DURING THE PESTICIDE APPLICATION PERIOD. IN CONTRAST, NO ACUTE SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON MACROINVERTEBRATES WERE OBSERVED AT SITES CHARACTERISED BY LOW WATER-PHASE TOXICITY (LOGTUMAX < –3.5). AN INFLUENCE OF RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIP WIDTH ON PESTICIDE EXPOSURE WAS NOT OBSERVED, SUPPOSEDLY BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF EROSION RILLS AND EPHEMERAL DITCHES.

SOME OF THESE CONTAMINANTS CAN INCREASE STREAM EUTROPHICATION AND ARE SUSPECTED OF CONTRIBUTING TO HYPOXIC CONDITIONS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. THIS RESEARCH QUANTIFIED EFFECTS OF LIVESTOCK GRAZING MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND VEGETATIVE FILTER STRIP BUFFERS ON RUNOFF DEPTH AND MASS LOSSES OF TOTAL SOLIDS, NITRATE-NITROGEN (NO3-N), AND ORTHO-PHOSPHORUS (PO4-P) UNDER NATURAL HYDROLOGIC CONDITIONS. RUNOFF DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 12 RAINFALL EVENTS DURING 2001 TO 2003 AT AN IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FARM IN CENTRAL IOWA, UNITED STATES. THREE VEGETATIVE BUFFERS (PADDOCK AREA:VEGETATIVE BUFFER AREA RATIOS OF 1:0.2, 1:0.1, AND 1:0 NO BUFFER [CONTROL]) AND THREE GRAZING MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (CONTINUOUS, ROTATIONAL, AND NO GRAZING [CONTROL]) COMPRISED NINE TREATMENT COMBINATIONS (VEGETATIVE BUFFER RATIO/GRAZING MANAGEMENT PRACTICE) REPLICATED IN THREE 1.35 HA (3.34 AC) PLOT AREAS. THE TOTAL 4.05 HA (10.02 AC) STUDY AREA ALSO INCLUDED NINE 0.4 HA (1.0 AC) PADDOCKS AND 27 VEGETATIVE BUFFER RUNOFF COLLECTION UNITS DISTRIBUTED IN A RANDOMIZED COMPLETE BLOCK DESIGN. THE STUDY SITE WAS ESTABLISHED ON UNEVEN TERRAIN WITH A MAXIMUM OF 15% SLOPES AND CONSISTED OF APPROXIMATELY 100% COOL-SEASON SMOOTH BROMEGRASS. AVERAGE PADDOCK AND VEGETATIVE BUFFER PLANT TILLER DENSITIES ESTIMATED DURING THE 2003 PROJECT SEASON WERE APPROXIMATELY 62 MILLION AND 93 MILLION TILLERS HA−1 (153 MILLION AND 230 MILLION TILLERS AC−1), RESPECTIVELY. RUNOFF SAMPLE COLLECTION PIPE LEAKAGE DISCOVERED AND CORRECTED DURING 2001 POSSIBLY REDUCED RUNOFF DEPTH AND AFFECTED RUNOFF CONTAMINANT MASS LOSSES DATA VALUES. CONSEQUENTLY, 2001 RUNOFF ANALYSIS RESULTS WERE LIMITED TO TREATMENT COMPARISONS WITHIN THE 2001 SEASON AND WERE NOT COMPARED WITH 2002 AND 2003 DATA. ANALYSIS RESULTS FROM 2001 SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN AVERAGE LOSSES OF RUNOFF, TOTAL SOLIDS, NO3-N, AND PO4-P AMONG THE NINE VEGETATIVE BUFFER/GRAZING PRACTICE TREATMENT COMBINATIONS. RESULTS FROM 2002 INDICATED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LOSSES OF RUNOFF AND TOTAL SOLIDS FROM 1:0 NO BUFFER/ROTATIONAL GRAZING AND 1:0 NO BUFFER/CONTINUOUS GRAZING TREATMENT COMBINATION PLOTS, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED AMONG OTHER 2002 SEASON TREATMENT COMBINATIONS. THE 2003 RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RUNOFF AND TOTAL SOLIDS LOSSES FROM 1:0 NO BUFFER/NO GRAZING TREATMENT COMBINATION PLOTS COMPARED AMONG ALL 2003 TREATMENT COMBINATIONS AND FROM 1:0.1 VEGETATIVE BUFFER/NO GRAZING TREATMENT COMBINATION PLOTS COMPARED AMONG ALL 2003 TREATMENT COMBINATIONS AND WITH RESPECTIVE 2002 TREATMENT COMBINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE 2003 RESULTS INDICATED EFFECTIVE VEGETATIVE BUFFER PERFORMANCE WITH SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RUNOFF, TOTAL SOLIDS, AND NO3-N LOSSES FROM THE LARGER 1:0.2 BUFFER AREA COMPARED AMONG THE SMALLER 1:0.1 BUFFER AREA AND 1:0 NO BUFFER TREATMENT COMBINATIONS. THE 2003 RESULTS ALSO INDICATED A HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN LOSSES OF NO3-N FROM 1:0.1 BUFFER/NO GRAZING TREATMENT COMBINATION PLOTS COMPARED AMONG OTHER 2003 SEASON TREATMENT COMBINATIONS AND WITH RESPECTIVE 2002 TREATMENT COMBINATIONS.

WE SPECULATE THIS SHIFT TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RUNOFF AND CONTAMINANT LOSSES FROM NO GRAZING TREATMENT COMBINATION PLOTS DURING 2003 REFLECTS THE VARIABILITY INHERENT TO A COMPLEX AND DYNAMIC SOIL-WATER ENVIRONMENT OF LIVESTOCK GRAZING AREAS. HOWEVER, WE ALSO HYPOTHESIZE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT LARGELY CONSISTED OF A DENSE PERENNIAL COOL-SEASON GRASS TYPE, HIGH-RELIEF LANDSCAPE, AND RELATIVELY HIGH TOTAL RAINFALL DEPTH MAY NOT NECESSARILY INCLUDE LIVESTOCK GRAZING ACTIVITIES.","65","1","34","41","TOTAL DISSOLVED SOLIDS; EUTROPHICATION; NITRATE; GRAZING; WATER QUALITY; FILTER STRIP; SAMPLE COLLECTION; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SURFACE RUNOFF; AGRONOMY","","","","","https://www.jswconline.org/content/65/1/34.abstract https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/abe_eng_pubs/230/ https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103067367.html https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103067367 https://www.jswconline.org/content/65/1/34.refs https://core.ac.uk/display/38933455 https://works.bepress.com/steven_mickelson/33/download/ http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1231&context=abe_eng_pubs https://core.ac.uk/download/38933455.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.2489/JSWC.65.1.34","","10.2489/jswc.65.1.34","2134753167","","0","003-148-094-786-550; 005-046-617-641-306; 010-433-383-886-36X; 011-227-693-282-050; 011-404-320-444-461; 019-036-305-723-619; 020-306-705-734-82X; 038-335-400-539-341; 038-439-180-047-201; 039-481-527-740-116; 040-198-568-662-726; 054-030-546-702-933; 054-142-450-794-649; 056-409-667-021-818; 057-131-240-501-938; 059-949-847-321-259; 062-459-234-621-52X; 066-513-898-486-631; 076-121-466-874-85X; 076-826-572-086-275; 079-196-971-304-319; 083-268-336-005-496; 087-135-266-264-121; 092-001-477-844-772; 092-243-016-623-346; 097-732-496-513-136; 100-572-395-204-584; 101-181-727-684-317; 101-813-796-974-45X; 104-494-518-145-022; 106-928-102-289-020; 107-002-386-586-197; 107-914-292-939-854; 115-642-860-718-878; 115-650-258-430-45X; 122-164-061-427-118; 128-195-997-346-382; 139-686-152-452-357; 142-912-781-466-437; 143-525-749-162-800; 165-740-369-689-328; 169-607-559-923-667; 179-039-702-328-618; 181-000-667-326-695","30","DAVID F.

ALTHOUGH FIELD BORDERS INCREASE BOBWHITE HABITAT AND INCREASE LOCAL POPULATIONS, UNDERSTANDING HOW THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE INFLUENCES BOBWHITE RESPONSE TO THIS MANAGEMENT PRACTICE IS CRITICAL TO EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION. WE DETERMINED THE RELATIVE INFLUENCE OF LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION AND FIELD BORDER IMPLEMENTATION ON BOBWHITE DENSITIES AND OCCUPANCY DYNAMICS AROUND CROP FIELDS IN NORTH CAROLINA AND SOUTH CAROLINA, USA. WE USED 10-MINUTE DISTANCE POINT COUNTS TO ESTIMATE DENSITY, OCCUPANCY, COLONIZATION, AND EXTINCTION RATES OF MALE BOBWHITE AROUND 154 AGRICULTURE FIELDS, HALF OF WHICH HAD A FALLOW FIELD BORDER. WE ESTIMATED PERCENT OF CROPLAND, FOREST, PASTURE, EARLY SUCCESSIONAL, AND URBAN COVER WITHIN 1- KM RADIUS BUFFERS (314HA) SURROUNDING ALL POINT COUNT LOCATIONS. WE EXAMINED THE INFLUENCE OF 6 PREDICTOR VARIABLES (LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION METRICS AND FIELD BORDER PRESENCE) ON BOBWHITE DENSITY AND OCCUPANCY DYNAMICS. BOBWHITE DENSITY INCREASED WITH THE PRESENCE OF FIELD BORDERS. CONVERSELY, BOBWHITE DENSITY DECREASED AS THE PERCENTAGE OF URBAN, PASTURE, AND FOREST LANDS INCREASED. THE PRESENCE OF A FIELD BORDER DID NOT INFLUENCE OCCUPANCY, COLONIZATION, OR EXTINCTION RATES. HOWEVER, AS THE PERCENTAGE OF CROPLAND INCREASED WITHIN THE LANDSCAPE, BOBWHITE OCCUPANCY INCREASED AND AS THE PERCENTAGE OF PASTURE INCREASED, BOBWHITE COLONIZATION DECREASED. AS THE PERCENTAGE OF FOREST AND URBAN INCREASED AND CROPLAND DECREASED, BOBWHITE EXTINCTION RATE INCREASED. OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT LOCAL ESTABLISHMENT OF FIELD BORDERS DOES NOT INCREASE BOBWHITE OCCUPANCY RATES, BUT FIELD BORDERS CAN INCREASE DENSITIES IN SUITABLE LANDSCAPES WHERE BOBWHITE ARE PRESENT. HABITAT RESTORATION FOR BOBWHITE WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY INCREASE POPULATION DENSITIES IF FOCUSED IN LANDSCAPES DOMINATED BY SUITABLE COVER TYPES, WHERE BOBWHITE OCCURRENCE IS HIGH. 2013 THE WILDLIFE SOCIETY.","78","1","93","100","OCCUPANCY; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; POPULATION DENSITY; GEOGRAPHY; PASTURE; WILDLIFE; URBANIZATION; HABITAT DESTRUCTION; RESTORATION ECOLOGY","","","","U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE; MULTISTATE CONSERVATION GRANT PROGRAM MS M-2-R; WILDLIFE AND SPORT FISH RESTORATION PROGRAM; ASSOCIATION OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AGENCIES; FISHERIES, WILDLIFE, AND CONSERVATION BIOLOGY PROGRAM","https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jwmg.639 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jwmg.639/abstract","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1002/JWMG.639","","10.1002/jwmg.639","2129787957","","0","003-514-811-453-642; 004-878-518-476-689; 005-013-299-612-786; 005-068-000-072-681; 008-528-640-582-739; 009-262-034-010-715; 018-128-541-350-350; 023-683-277-287-21X; 024-233-811-621-512; 026-503-686-110-018; 032-521-194-666-198; 032-563-160-588-721; 034-308-643-508-970; 034-350-057-263-068; 034-456-136-124-424; 040-618-665-169-421; 043-388-671-984-332; 044-114-542-356-91X; 049-116-206-901-318; 051-968-065-430-322; 063-078-669-045-864; 066-775-029-249-36X; 068-567-084-277-634; 072-168-292-167-022; 072-270-823-716-141; 072-745-845-642-67X; 073-352-367-110-132; 074-241-310-816-85X; 084-426-480-835-483; 109-359-974-878-596; 109-857-896-745-756; 109-963-986-230-480; 115-521-700-055-314; 122-171-329-916-226; 139-914-557-884-686; 141-760-573-202-465; 158-108-874-474-851; 166-152-846-701-103; 166-806-633-528-132; 179-513-204-819-129; 193-598-530-261-354","8","SHANNON A.

THREE TREATMENTS HAVE BEEN TESTED: (1) CABBAGE ADJACENT TO A WILDFLOWER STRIP, (2) CABBAGE NEAR TO A WILDFLOWER STRIP (>10 M UP TO 90 M), AND (3 = CONTROL) CABBAGE WITHOUT WILDFLOWER STRIP OR ANY OTHER SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS NEARBY. CATERPILLARS AND EGGS OF MAMESTRA BRASSICAE, PIERIS RAPAE, AND PLUTELLA XYLOSTELLA (ONLY LARVAE) HAVE BEEN SAMPLED WEEKLY IN THE UNSPRAYED CABBAGE CROPS AT 6 DATES (CAULIFLOWER) AND 9 DATES (RED CABBAGE). THE PARASITISM RATE OF EACH PEST SPECIES AND ITS STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT WAS RECORDED. CATERPILLARS OF M. BRASSICAE AND P. RAPAE WERE PARASITISED AT A HIGHER RATE IN CABBAGE FIELDS NEAR TO THE WILDFLOWER STRIP. IN CONTRAST, CATERPILLARS OF P. XYLOSTELLA WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PARASITISED IN THE FIELD WITHOUT STRIP. THE PARASITISM RATE OF EGGS WAS RELATIVELY LOW IN GENERAL (14-35%), BUT INCREASED IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE STRIPS. IN ADDITION, THE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF PARASITIC WASP FAMILIES (HYMENOPTERA PARASITICA) RECORDED BY SWEEP NET CATCHES WERE MUCH HIGHER IN WILDFLOWER STRIPS (UP TO 3 FOLD MORE SPECIMENS THAN IN CAULIFLOWER; 14-16 FAMILIES) THAN IN THE CABBAGE CROPS (7-11 FAMILIES). IN CONCLUSION, DATA OF THIS ON-FARM TRIAL INDICATE THAT WILDFLOWER STRIPS ENHANCE THE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF PARASITIC WASPS, AND THUS MAY IMPROVE PARASITISM OF CERTAIN LEPIDOPTERAN CABBAGE PESTS IN ADJACENT FIELDS.","","","","","HORTICULTURE; LARVA; PEST ANALYSIS; WILDFLOWER; PLUTELLA; PIERIS RAPAE; PARASITISM; HYMENOPTERA; RED CABBAGE; AGRONOMY; BIOLOGY","","","","","https://www.biogeography.unibas.ch/Publikationen/papers/pfiffner_%20merkelbach_luka_2003.pdf https://orgprints.org/id/eprint/947/ https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lukas_Pfiffner/publication/237290402_Do_sown_wildflower_strips_enhance_the_parasitism_of_lepidopteran_pests_in_cabbage_crops/links/00b495304963079674000000.pdf","HTTPS://WWW.BIOGEOGRAPHY.UNIBAS.CH/PUBLIKATIONEN/PAPERS/PFIFFNER_%20MERKELBACH_LUKA_2003.PDF","","","2112482455","","0","010-945-646-716-071; 015-648-440-419-195; 026-735-761-517-671; 041-768-237-199-317; 044-315-002-495-725; 056-345-625-364-775; 056-892-630-404-500; 060-884-804-074-471; 095-787-505-942-81X; 115-011-427-041-375; 122-528-143-728-138; 126-567-876-134-094; 138-874-200-436-40X; 185-762-846-999-381","19","LUKAS PFIFFNER; L.

FUNCTIONING OF A BZ DEPENDS ON SOIL STRUCTURE, AS IT IS IMPORTANT FOR WATER INFILTRATION. THEREFORE, IT IS VITAL TO UNDERSTAND HOW VARYING MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AFFECT SOILS OF BZS. WE STUDIED THE STRUCTURAL AND HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES OF THREE DIFFERENTLY MANAGED BZS ESTABLISHED IN A BOREAL VERTIC STAGNIC CAMBISOL (CLAY, 51%). THE THREE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR VEGETATION WERE AS FOLLOWS: NATURAL WITH NO TREATMENT, HARVESTED YEARLY AND GRAZED BY CATTLE. WE USED BULK DENSITY AND MACROPOROSITY, TOGETHER WITH A PORE GEOMETRY INDEX (AIR PERMEABILITY PER UNIT AIR-FILLED POROSITY), TO DESCRIBE THE SOIL STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES. HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES WERE MEASURED AT DIFFERENT LENGTH SCALES BY MEANS OF AN AGGREGATE SORPTIVITY TEST, SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY OF THE CORE SAMPLES AND FIELD-SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY. VEGETATION MANAGEMENT MARKEDLY AFFECTED THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES IN THE TOP 5 CM OF THE SOIL. PROPERTIES WERE LEAST FAVOURABLE FOR INFILTRATION AT THE GRAZED SITE, WITH THE GREATEST BULK DENSITY, LEAST MACROPOROSITY AND HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY OR GREATEST PORE TORTUOSITY. IN GENERAL, SPATIAL VARIATION IN ZONES WITH RESTRICTED AND GOOD HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY TOGETHER WITH REDUCED AGGREGATE SORPTIVITY IN THE DEEPER HORIZONS MADE THE SOIL PRONE TO PREFERENTIAL FLOW WHEN INITIALLY DRY. PROLONGED WETNESS, ON THE OTHER HAND, REDUCED SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY SIGNIFICANTLY, RESULTING IN SURFACE RUN-OFF.

WEED RESEARCH 52, 88–97.; ; ; ; SUMMARY; ; SOWN GRASS STRIPS HAVE BEEN WIDELY ESTABLISHED ON FIELD MARGINS ACROSS FRANCE, BECAUSE OF THEIR EXPECTED ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. THEY MAY ALSO ENHANCE THE DIVERSITY OF PLANT SPECIES IN THE ADJACENT BOUNDARY BY BUFFERING THEM FROM AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. HOWEVER, THE STRIPS COULD ACT AS AN EXTENDED RESERVOIR FOR WEEDS AND INCREASE THEIR DISPERSAL INTO THE FIELD. THIS STUDY EVALUATED THE IMPACT OF A 5-M-WIDE SOWN GRASS STRIP ON (I) THE WEED RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF BOTH BOUNDARY AND FIELD ADJACENT HABITATS AND ON (II) THE WIDTH OF THE EDGE ZONE WITHIN THE FIELD, DEFINED AS THE ZONE WHERE BOUNDARY HABITATS IMPACT THE FLORA IN THE FIELD. WE SURVEYED THE FLORA IN 10 FIELDS ALONG CONTINUOUS TRANSECTS RUNNING FROM THE BOUNDARY TOWARD THE CENTRE OF THE FIELD ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF EACH FIELD, ONE SIDE WITH A SOWN GRASS STRIP AND ONE SIDE WITHOUT. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SOWN GRASS STRIPS DID NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL SPECIES RICHNESS AT THE FIELD SCALE, BUT MODIFIED ITS DISTRIBUTION IN THE DIFFERENT HABITATS. IN THE BOUNDARIES, PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS, TOTAL ABUNDANCE OR DIVERSITY (SHANNON INDEX) REMAINED UNCHANGED WHEN A SOWN GRASS STRIP WAS PRESENT, WHEREAS THESE INDICATORS SHARPLY DECREASED IN THE CROP EDGE (−10.9 SPECIES AND −86.4 INDIVIDUALS PER 1.25 M2) AND IN THE FIELD MARGIN (−3.6 SPECIES AND −9.6 INDIVIDUALS PER 1.25 M2) WHERE THE GRASS STRIP WAS PRESENT. SOWN GRASS STRIPS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED THE WIDTH OF THE EDGE ZONE, FROM 6.5 TO 1.5 M FOR SPECIES RICHNESS AND FROM 12 TO 1 M FOR SPECIES DIVERSITY, DEMONSTRATING A DECREASE IN WEED INGRESS INTO THE CROP.","52","1","88","97","CROP; HABITAT; WEED; DIVERSITY INDEX; SPECIES RICHNESS; SPECIES DIVERSITY; AGRONOMY; TRANSECT; ABUNDANCE (ECOLOGY); BIOLOGY","","","","","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephane_Cordeau/publication/255681576_Sown_grass_strips_harbour_high_weed_diversity_but_decrease_weed_richness_in_adjacent_crops/links/00b4952025be0d9170000000.pdf https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2011.00892.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2011.00892.x/abstract https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND44686226 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2011.00892.x","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1365-3180.2011.00892.X","","10.1111/j.1365-3180.2011.00892.x","1913391954","","0","005-790-227-442-665; 007-243-303-723-240; 012-335-108-074-344; 016-421-756-148-512; 024-397-401-767-800; 031-862-039-493-29X; 043-663-463-772-769; 049-080-560-165-147; 057-001-477-328-971; 059-280-274-716-779; 060-114-103-966-089; 060-708-377-821-918; 065-071-886-701-523; 070-239-213-610-528; 070-365-342-030-594; 073-865-623-324-417; 081-068-405-899-608; 083-123-409-417-778; 083-412-860-749-866; 096-364-192-925-534; 099-982-967-417-832; 102-362-526-374-610; 124-993-652-958-27X; 132-187-296-108-394; 133-048-738-071-733; 151-368-087-827-60X; 152-856-891-760-185; 154-954-037-373-102; 169-228-174-821-424; 180-157-128-386-145; 190-044-180-699-941; 197-798-610-196-806","26","STÉPHANE CORDEAU; SANDRINE PETIT; XAVIER REBOUD; BRUNO CHAUVEL","WEED RESEARCH","WEED RESEARCH","","LENS",0,"CORDEAU S, 2011, WEED RESEARCH","CORDEAU S, 2011, WEED RESEARCH"

INTRODUCING A SOWN WILDFLOWER COMPONENT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE DRAMATICALLY THE VALUE OF THESE BUFFER STRIPS FOR A SUITE OF NATIVE SPECIES, INCLUDING BUTTERFLIES. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AIMING TO PROMOTE THE ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF WILDFLOWERS IN EXISTING BUFFER STRIPS. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TWO METHODS USED TO INCREASE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF WILDFLOWERS FOR THE BENEFIT OF NATIVE BUTTERFLY SPECIES WERE TESTED, BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND IN COMBINATION. THE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WERE: (1) THE APPLICATION OF A SELECTIVE GRAMINICIDE (FLUAZIFOP-P-BUTYL) WHICH REDUCES THE DOMINANCE OF COMPETITIVE GRASSES; AND (2) SCARIFICATION OF THE SOIL WHICH CREATES GERMINATION NICHES FOR SOWN WILDFLOWER SEEDS. A WILDFLOWER SEED MIX CONSISTING OF NINE SPECIES WAS SOWN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SCARIFICATION TREATMENT. RESPONSES OF WILDFLOWERS AND BUTTERFLIES WERE MONITORED FOR TWO YEARS AFTER ESTABLISHMENT. RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE COMBINED SCARIFICATION AND GRAMINICIDE TREATMENT PRODUCED THE GREATEST COVER AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF SOWN WILDFLOWERS. BUTTERFLY ABUNDANCE, SPECIES RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY WERE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH SOWN WILDFLOWER SPECIES RICHNESS, WITH THE HIGHEST VALUES IN THE COMBINED SCARIFICATION AND GRAMINICIDE TREATMENT. THESE FINDINGS HAVE CONFIRMED THE IMPORTANCE OF BOTH SCARIFICATION AS A MEANS OF INTRODUCING WILDFLOWER SEED INTO EXISTING BUFFER STRIPS, AND SUBSEQUENT MANAGEMENT USING GRAMINICIDES, FOR THE BENEFIT OF BUTTERFLIES.

WHILE CONTOUR HEDGEROW SYSTEMS ARE AN EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR SOIL WATER CONSERVATION, THERE ARE A FEW STUDIES ON ITS EFFECT IN THE RED SOIL HILLY AREAS IN SOUTHEAST CHINA. WITH A FIXED FIELD EXPERIMENT, WE CONSTRUCTED A RUNOFF PLOT AT HILLY AREA IN ZHUJI COUNTY, ZHEJIANG PROVINCE, TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF THE GRASS HEDGEROWS IN SOIL WATER CONSERVATION, AND TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMIZED HEDGEROW PATTERNS. HEMEROCALLIS CITRINE (HC) AND OPHIOPOGON JAPONICAS (OJ) WERE SELECTED TO BUILD THE HEDGEROWS IN PATTERNS OF ONE ROW AND TWO ROWS. THE REE METHOD WAS USED TO TRACE THE SOURCE OF THE SEDIMENT FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHARACTERISTIC AND MECHANISM OF EROSION WITH HEDGEROWS CONTROL. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT (1) HEDGEROWS REDUCED EROSION AND SURFACE RUNOFF BY 31.99–67.22% AND 15.44–45.11%, RESPECTIVELY; (2) HEDGEROWS DELAYED THE DEVELOPMENT OF RILLS; (3) HEDGEROWS REDUCED THE SOIL NUTRIENTS LOSS; (4) HEDGEROWS RESHAPED THE SOIL PHYSICAL PROPERTIES, ESPECIALLY IN INCREASING >0.25 MM WATER-STABLE AGGREGATES. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT TWO-ROW OJ IS THE OPTIMIZED CONTOUR HEDGEROW PATTERN IN THE EXPERIMENT CONDITION, AND DOWNWARD SLOPING LAND SHOULD HAVE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO TAKE MEASURES FOR SOIL WATER CONSERVATION. THIS RESEARCH COMPREHENSIVELY STUDIED THE EFFECTS AND MECHANISM OF CONTOUR HEDGEROWS IN CONTROLLING SOIL AND WATER LOSS IN RED SOIL HILLY AREAS, SOUTHEAST CHINA, SO THAT THE PRACTICE OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION CAN BE IMPLEMENTED MORE EFFECTIVELY IN THESE AREAS.","30","2","107","116","SOIL CONSERVATION; EROSION; SOIL WATER; SEDIMENT; SOIL NUTRIENTS; FIXED FIELD; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SURFACE RUNOFF; AGROFORESTRY; RED SOIL","","","","NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA; NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1001627915000037","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.IJSRC.2015.03.001","","10.1016/j.ijsrc.2015.03.001","254803008","","0","000-795-980-515-204; 000-987-201-023-021; 002-430-400-638-330; 002-916-363-298-786; 003-288-437-442-19X; 004-067-478-858-260; 004-888-878-452-882; 005-977-897-976-981; 008-262-416-247-172; 011-352-218-713-870; 012-133-504-974-402; 019-786-820-772-039; 020-746-656-930-427; 024-667-507-824-436; 028-830-422-813-669; 036-308-750-685-430; 042-417-252-147-728; 046-498-659-189-092; 046-864-730-255-927; 047-681-130-465-570; 050-630-261-109-566; 052-256-893-842-403; 052-696-208-948-648; 054-232-154-759-995; 056-784-300-497-224; 058-822-796-281-220; 060-335-125-908-604; 061-964-645-875-912; 068-706-657-761-472; 077-657-217-475-358; 080-321-243-422-726; 085-752-598-024-838; 090-922-565-063-718; 094-500-765-119-558; 097-311-819-910-510; 102-536-063-686-913; 109-463-668-363-535; 109-953-506-304-374; 111-591-686-489-164; 116-339-031-779-029; 122-135-236-013-871; 126-133-118-875-645; 126-769-600-146-583; 128-704-477-427-464; 132-831-930-123-597; 133-817-779-828-150; 150-120-916-668-808; 154-450-759-160-37X; 160-853-050-682-668; 165-630-103-608-351; 169-670-736-733-314; 171-287-689-167-136; 180-111-929-801-202; 192-341-972-259-42X; 195-682-433-825-36X; 198-752-445-354-921","11","JI FAN; LIJIAO YAN; PEI ZHANG; GE ZHANG","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH","","LENS",0,"FAN J, 2015, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH","FAN J, 2015, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH"

APPROPRIATE AGROECOSYSTEMS MANAGEMENT MAY FAVOUR THIS TYPE OF INDIRECT INTERACTION. IN THAT CONTEXT, OUR AIM WAS TO TEST THE EFFECT OF ROSE BUSH [ROSA RUGOSA (THUNB.)] STRIPS ON THE BUILDING UP OF APHID POPULATIONS AND OF THEIR NATURAL ENEMIES IN ADJACENT CEREAL HABITATS. SEVERAL APHID SPECIES ARE CURRENTLY FOUND ON ROSA SP. INCLUDING METOPOLOPHIUM DIRHODUM (WALKER) FOR WHICH IT IS A PRIMARY HOST. APHID PREDATORS AND PARASITOIDS MAY BUILD THEIR POPULATIONS ON THE APHID POPULATION PRESENT ON ROSA SP. AND LATER ON MIGRATE TO WHEAT FIELD DURING THE CEREAL APHID INFESTATION. MOREOVER, THE FLOWERS OF THE ROSE BUSHES MAY PROVIDE A SOURCE OF NECTAR AND POLLEN TO THESE NATURAL ENEMIES. OUR EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED IN THREE ROSE MARGIN WHEAT PLOTS WITH A STRIP OF ROSE BUSHES OF R. RUGOSA AND THREE CONTROL PLOTS. PLOTS WERE COMPARED DURING 2 YEARS (2003 AND 2004). APHID, PARASITOID AND PREDATOR DENSITIES WERE RECORDED FROM MAY TO THE HARVEST OF WHEAT ON ROSE BUSHES AND IN WHEAT. IN 2003, THE APHID DENSITIES WERE MODERATE BUT IN 2004, THE POPULATION OF APHID WAS VERY HIGH. EVEN IF PREDATOR AND PARASITOIDS ARRIVED EARLIER IN ROSE MARGIN FIELD THAN IN CONTROL ONES, THE PRESENCE OF ROSE BUSHES DID NOT INFLUENCE THE APHID POPULATION WITHIN THE FIELD. METOPOLOPHIUM DIRHODUM DID NOT SEEM TO MIGRATE FROM THE ROSE BUSHES TO WHEAT. THE LEVEL OF PARASITISM WAS WEAK IN ROSE BUSHES AND THE NATURAL ENEMY POPULATION WAS NOT DIFFERENT IN ROSE MARGIN WHEAT AND IN CONTROL PLOTS. THE CAUSES OF THE LACK OF EFFICIENCY OF THIS TYPE OF MANAGEMENT ARE DISCUSSED AS WELL AS THE HIGH APHID POPULATION IN WHEAT IN 2004.","131","4","275","283","BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL; PREDATION; APHID; APHIDIDAE; HOMOPTERA; POPULATION; BOTANY; AGRONOMY; BIOLOGY; COMPETITION (BIOLOGY); PREDATOR","","","","","https://dial.uclouvain.be/handle/boreal:37660 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01157.x/abstract https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01157.x","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1439-0418.2007.01157.X","","10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01157.x","2115985783","","0","005-857-336-036-969; 006-738-405-761-246; 007-081-271-794-001; 007-644-796-937-550; 011-131-884-656-311; 012-241-644-554-168; 012-466-311-051-172; 032-073-120-881-796; 052-891-269-647-359; 056-892-630-404-500; 067-153-883-971-001; 079-279-555-206-940; 096-336-980-279-299; 103-348-929-033-891; 116-022-995-056-962; 122-288-811-836-821; 123-157-516-062-17X; 123-572-800-216-760; 137-890-231-651-640; 192-182-455-331-555","29","ISABELLE FRÈRE; JEAN FABRY; THIERRY HANCE","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY","","LENS",0,"FRÈRE I, 2007, JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY","FRÈRE I, 2007, JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY"

BARRIERS PLANTED ABOVE FESCUE (FESTUCA ARUNDINACEA SCHREB.) FS IN REDUCING RUNOFF WATER, SEDIMENT, N, AND P LOSSES IN CONCENTRATED FLOW FROM AN AERIC VERTIC EPIAQUALF ON A 5% SLOPE. SIMULATED RAINFALL WAS APPLIED ON PLOTS CONSISTING OF A 1.5-M-WIDE BY 8-M-LONG POLLUTANT SOURCE AREA WITH AN ARTIFICIALLY CONSTRUCTED CHANNEL TO CONCENTRATE SURFACE RUNOFF. THE SOURCE AREA WAS BOUNDED DOWNSLOPE BY EITHER AN 8-M LONG FESCUE FS OR 0.7 M OF ACTIVE OR DORMANT BARRIER ABOVE A 7.3-M-LONG FESCUE FS. THE B-FS TREATMENT ALSO REDUCED SEDIMENT LOSS BY 91% WHILE THE FS REDUCED SEDIMENT BY ONLY 72% (P < 0.01). THE B-FS ALSO REDUCED SEDIMENT LOSS BY 90%, WHEREAS FS REDUCED SEDIMENT ONLY 60% WHEN INFLOW WAS ADDED TO THE PLOTS. THE B-FS TRAPPED 4.9 TIMES MORE ORGANIC N, 2.3 TIMES MORE NH 4 -N, AND 3.7 TIMES MORE PARTICULATE P THAN FS AT 0.7 M (P < 0.01). SEDIMENT AND NUTRIENT TRAPPING INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH FS LENGTH. SWITCHGRASS BARRIERS ABOVE THE FS DISPERSED AND TEMPORARILY PONDED CONCENTRATED RUNOFF, ENABLING INCREASED SEDIMENT DEPOSITION. BARRIERS MAY BE A POTENTIAL CONSERVATION STRATEGY FOR REHABILITATION OF LANDS AFFECTED WITH CONCENTRATED FLOW WHERE TRADITIONAL PRACTICES ARE INADEQUATE.","68","6","1963","1972","ANIMAL SCIENCE; NUTRIENT; PARTICULATES; FESTUCA ARUNDINACEA; PANICUM VIRGATUM; SEDIMENT; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SURFACE RUNOFF; FLOW (PSYCHOLOGY); POLLUTANT","","","","MISSOURI AGRIC.

WE THEREFORE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND FACTORS THAT RULE DAMAGE FOR DEVELOPING AGROECOLOGICAL CONTROL STRATEGIES. IN THIS INVESTIGATION, WE TESTED THE EFFECT OF AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES AND LOCAL LANDSCAPE ON WIREWORM DAMAGE IN MAIZE CROPS. WE SURVEYED WIREWORM DAMAGE IN 341 FIELDS UNDER VARIOUS CONDITIONS IN WESTERN FRANCE IN 2011 AND 2012. WE USED IN PARTICULAR A RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM TO IMPUTE MISSING VALUES AND AN AUTOMATED MODEL SELECTION ROUTINE TO SELECT THE BEST BETA REGRESSION MODEL. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE OCCURRENCE OF GRASSLAND IN THE ROTATION INCREASES WIREWORM DAMAGE. TILLAGE ALSO SHOWS A HIGH INFLUENCE, THOUGH VARYING WITH SEASON AND YEAR. WIREWORM DAMAGE IS DECREASED BY THE PRESENCE OF HEDGES OR CULTIVATED CROPS AT THE FIELD BORDER, WHEREAS IT IS INCREASED BY THE PRESENCE OF GRASSLAND AT THE FIELD BORDER. OVERALL, OUR FINDINGS PROVIDE SOME INSIGHTS TO DEVELOP PREVENTIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THE SUSTAINABLE CONTROL OF WIREWORMS, AS WELL AS A FRAMEWORK FOR DATA PROCESSING TO ANALYZE A WIDE RANGE OF SIMILAR SITUATIONS INVOLVING OTHER CROPS AND PESTS.","35","2","793","802","AGRICULTURE; AGROECOLOGY; TILLAGE; GRASSLAND; BETA REGRESSION; CURATIVE TREATMENT; CROP PROTECTION; AGROFORESTRY; SCALE (SOCIAL SCIENCES); AGRONOMY; BIOLOGY","","","","","https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01284300/document https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs13593-014-0279-5.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13593-014-0279-5 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01284300","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1007/S13593-014-0279-5","","10.1007/s13593-014-0279-5","1988522076","","0","003-995-290-828-321; 010-126-263-188-487; 011-433-452-202-125; 013-610-647-331-186; 014-722-119-842-735; 015-611-720-732-777; 019-662-289-090-564; 021-021-879-814-114; 021-276-230-258-509; 025-987-982-793-607; 028-237-504-948-367; 029-269-886-943-061; 029-863-423-297-632; 033-124-054-887-703; 046-766-508-337-383; 046-851-860-385-698; 047-915-844-175-136; 053-882-087-587-342; 057-173-163-207-385; 065-099-112-753-009; 065-652-561-622-304; 066-304-772-058-083; 068-096-946-517-526; 072-802-531-827-848; 076-863-055-982-955; 083-735-425-371-439; 084-387-070-806-39X; 088-400-571-350-393; 092-220-232-726-188; 105-089-012-191-379; 111-577-747-999-870; 124-812-329-736-102; 134-312-556-034-559; 138-363-976-718-24X; 149-250-414-297-242; 150-325-162-873-23X; 158-758-956-255-657","17","STÉPHANIE SAUSSURE; MANUEL PLANTEGENEST; JEAN-BAPTISTE THIBORD; PHILIPPE LARROUDÉ; SYLVAIN POGGI","AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","","LENS",0,"SAUSSURE S, 2015, AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","SAUSSURE S, 2015, AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT"

SECONDARY FUNCTIONS INCLUDE REDUCING RUNOFF VOLUME AND VELOCITY AND RETAINING SEDIMENTS AND HARMFUL SUBSTANCES FROM ADJACENT FIELDS. GRASS COVER (SWARD)-DAMAGING SEDIMENTATION IN THE GWW IS COMMONLY REDUCED BY FREQUENT MOWING, BUT IN DOING SO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE WATERWAY RELATIVE TO THE SECONDARY FUNCTIONS IS REDUCED. OUR OBJECTIVES WERE TO (I) EVALUATE WHETHER THE MAINTENANCE OF A GWW CAN BE REDUCED IF ON-SITE EROSION CONTROL IS EFFECTIVE, (II) MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUCH A GWW, AND (III) ANALYZE THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS. A LONG-TERM (1994-2000) LANDSCAPE EXPERIMENT WAS PERFORMED IN FOUR WATERSHEDS, WHERE TWO HAD GWWS FOR WHICH MAINTENANCE WAS LARGELY NEGLECTED. AN INTENSIVE SOIL CONSERVATION SYSTEM WAS ESTABLISHED ON ALL FIELDS. RUNOFF AND SEDIMENT DELIVERY WERE CONTINUOUSLY MEASURED IN THE TWO WATERSHEDS WITH GWWS AND IN THEIR PAIRED WATERSHEDS THAT WERE SIMILAR, BUT WITHOUT GWWS. RUNOFF WAS REDUCED BY 90 AND 10% FOR THE TWO SETS OF PAIRED WATERSHEDS, RESPECTIVELY. THE DIFFERENT EFFICIENCIES OF THE GWWS RESULTED FROM DIFFERENT LAYOUTS (DOUBLED WIDTH AND FLAT-BOTTOMED VS.

THE RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY WAS THAT REPLICATED BUFFER PLOT STUDIES HAD SHOWN THAT VEGETATED BUFFERS WILL EFFECTIVELY ASSIMILATE N, BUT IT WAS NOT KNOWN WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD WORK AT A LARGER SCALE. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON A COMMERCIAL FARM NEAR TIFTON, GEORGIA. WASTEWATER WAS PUMPED FROM A SINGLE-STAGE ANAEROBIC LAGOON TO VEGETATED BUFFERS COMPOSED OF GRASS AND MATURE OR NEWLY PLANTED PINES. THE BUFFERS APPROXIMATED 60 M IN LENGTH BY 90 M IN WIDTH. THE UPPER 10 M OF EACH BUFFER WAS IN GRASS, WHILE THE DOWNSLOPE AREA WAS IN MATURE OR NEWLY PLANTED PINES. SIX BUFFERS WERE INSTRUMENTED FOR WASTEWATER APPLICATION AND WATER QUALITY MONITORING. TWO BUFFERS RECEIVED WASTEWATER AT A 1X RATE (600 KG N HA-1 YEAR-1), TWO AT A 3/4X RATE (450 KG N HA-1 YEAR-1), AND TWO SERVED AS CONTROLS. THE WASTEWATER WAS APPLIED TO THE 10 M GRASSED PORTION OF THE BUFFERS. TRANSECTS OF SHALLOW GROUNDWATER WELLS STARTING AT THE GRASS-FOREST INTERFACE AND RUNNING DOWNSLOPE WERE USED TO MONITOR WATER QUALITY N. THE STUDY SHOWED MIXED RESULTS CONCERNING N ASSIMILATION BY THE BUFFERS. UPSLOPE LAND USE CHANGES BY THE PRODUCER DURING THE STUDY ADDED SIGNIFICANT N INPUTS TO ONE SET OF BUFFERS, AND THEY WERE UNABLE TO ASSIMILATE SUFFICIENT N FROM BOTH THESE INPUTS AND THE WASTEWATER TO PROTECT SHALLOW GROUNDWATER QUALITY. IN CONTRAST, ALMOST ALL SAMPLINGS OF SHALLOW GROUNDWATER UNDER THE BUFFERS RECEIVING N ONLY FROM THE OVERLAND FLOW APPLIED SWINE LAGOON EFFLUENT SHOWED NITRATE (NO3-N) CONCENTRATIONS 20 AND 30 M DOWNSLOPE TO BE LOWER THAN 10 MG L-1 (DRINKING WATER STANDARD). ON THESE BUFFERS, NO3-N CONCENTRATIONS IN SHALLOW GROUNDWATER WERE NEAR BACKGROUND LEVELS FIVE YEARS AFTER WASTEWATER APPLICATION COMMENCED. THE STUDY INDICATED THAT THE RATIO OF BUFFER AREA WIDTH TO WASTEWATER APPLICATION AREA WIDTH ON THE LANDSCAPE SHOULD BE AT LEAST 1:1, AND THAT BUFFERS FOR PROTECTION OF WATER QUALITY SHOULD BE CONTINUOUS ON THE LANDSCAPE. IT WAS CONCLUDED FROM THE STUDY THAT BUFFERS CAN BE USED AT THE FARM SCALE TO ASSIMILATE N FROM APPLIED WASTEWATER WHEN THEY ARE SUFFICIENTLY WIDE RELATIVE TO WASTE APPLICATION AREA, RATE, AND OTHER N SOURCES AT THE FARM SCALE.","50","1","53","64","BIODEGRADABLE WASTE; EFFLUENT; NITRATE; ANAEROBIC LAGOON; WATER QUALITY; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SURFACE RUNOFF; GROUNDWATER; ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING; WASTEWATER","","","","","https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/10721 http://elibrary.asabe.org/abstract.asp??JID=3&AID=22411","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.13031/2013.22411","","10.13031/2013.22411","2075087715","","0","001-487-853-597-667; 002-916-363-298-786; 015-325-416-202-141; 030-952-205-937-160; 040-507-938-290-621; 055-590-572-243-787; 064-240-859-714-503; 064-656-269-307-94X; 075-695-242-426-755; 085-980-507-337-463; 086-190-138-130-44X; 095-263-397-244-602; 107-914-292-939-854; 108-531-822-357-682; 114-332-933-788-296; 130-940-780-158-38X; 146-884-526-389-710; 175-306-631-667-644; 177-770-652-793-529","3","ROBERT K.

TYPICALLY, NO NUTRIENTS OR PESTICIDES ARE APPLIED IN THESE MARGINS, WHICH MAY BE SOWN EITHER WITH A CROP OR WITH GRASSES AND NATIVE FLOWERING PLANTS. IN SOME CASES THE MARGINS ARE MOWN, WHILE IN OTHERS THEY ARE LEFT ALONE. NEWLY ESTABLISHED GRASS MARGINS ARE LESS SPECIES-RICH THAN FIELD BOUNDARIES OR ROAD VERGES WITH A LONG HISTORY, JUSTIFYING THE EXPECTATION THAT FIELD MARGINS, IF PROPERLY MANAGED AND GIVEN TIME AND APPROPRIATE SEED SOURCES, COULD DEVELOP INTO RELATIVELY SPECIES-RICH VEGETATION. WE STUDIED THE BIODIVERSITY OF BOTH MARGINS TAKEN OUT OF PRODUCTION AND ADJACENT DITCH BANKS IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING INITIAL ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MARGINS. TO THIS END WE COMBINED THE DATA OF THREE DIFFERENT PROJECTS IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE STATISTICAL ANALYSES. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS OF THE FIELD MARGINS INCREASED IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING ESTABLISHMENT OVER A PERIOD OF FOUR YEARS. IN ADDITION, SHIFTS IN SPECIES COMPOSITION INDICATED A DECREASE IN SOIL NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS. THE SPECIES RICHNESS OF BOTH BUTTERFLIES AND DRAGONFLIES MAY INCREASE. THE MOST STRIKING RESULT WAS THE MARKED INCREASE IN THE PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS OF THE ADJACENT DITCH BANKS IN THE FIVE YEARS FOLLOWING CREATION OF THE MARGINS. HERE, TOO, CHANGES IN SPECIES COMPOSITION INDICATED A DECREASE IN SOIL NITRATE. IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FIELD MARGINS THERE WAS NO INCREASE IN THE COVER OF AGRICULTURALLY HARMFUL WEEDS IN THESE MARGINS. HOWEVER, THE NUMBER OF HARMFUL NEMATODES INCREASED.

THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THIS MANAGEMENT PRESCRIPTION FOR BUTTERFLIES ARE UNKNOWN. SIMILARLY, MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED ON HOW TO MANAGE THIS HABITAT TO MAXIMISE THE PROVISION OF POLLEN AND NECTAR RESOURCES WHILST PROTECTING BREEDING HABITAT FOR BUTTERFLIES. THIS STUDY AIMED TO DEVISE MIXTURES AND CUTTING MANAGEMENT REGIMES WHICH ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF SEED MIXTURE, TIMING AND FREQUENCY OF CUTTING, AND REMOVAL OF CUT MATERIAL ON VEGETATION COMPOSITION, FLOWER RESOURCE AVAILABILITY AND POLLINATORS (THE ABUNDANCE, SPECIES RICHNESS AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF BUTTERFLIES AND BUMBLEBEES, INCLUDING MALES AND QUEENS, ATTRACTED TO THE MIXTURES). WE RECOMMEND THAT NECTAR FLOWER MIXTURES ARE REFINED BY THE INCLUSION OF THE BEST PERFORMING SPECIES TO PROVIDE MID- AND LATE-SEASON FORAGE RESOURCES (TRIFOLIUM SPP., LOTUS CORNICULATUS AND CENTAUREA NIGRA), AND THE REMOVAL OF COMPETITIVE GRASS SPECIES. SUMMER CUTTING IN MAY OR EARLY JUNE, WITH REMOVAL OF HERBAGE WHERE POSSIBLE, SHOULD BE APPLIED TO HALF THE PATCH TO EXTEND THE FLOWERING SEASON, AND MINIMISE DAMAGE TO BUTTERFLY BREEDING HABITAT. THIS SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE TYPICAL AUTUMN CUT TO THE WHOLE PATCH.

ENHANCED USE OF SOWN GRASS STRIPS BY GRASSHOPPERS CAN BE SEEN AS A DIRECT EFFECT OF ESTABLISHMENT AND MANAGEMENT OPTIONS, BUT ALSO AS AN EFFECT OF THE RARITY AND INSTABILITY OF OTHER GRASSLAND HABITATS IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES.","159","","105","111","HAY; AGRICULTURE; HABITAT; GRASSLAND; ACRIDIDAE; GRASSHOPPER; CONTEXT (LANGUAGE USE); SPECIES RICHNESS; AGROFORESTRY; AGRONOMY; BIOLOGY","","","","","https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00714365 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/436882 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880912002435 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167880912002435","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.AGEE.2012.06.017","","10.1016/j.agee.2012.06.017","2095906203","","0","003-251-732-418-644; 006-285-430-699-043; 012-357-805-545-268; 013-088-014-679-212; 016-421-756-148-512; 026-527-744-858-38X; 031-796-403-225-855; 040-253-713-116-916; 043-009-269-441-396; 047-946-954-821-823; 053-710-838-701-96X; 054-715-078-148-813; 055-946-607-021-418; 059-804-606-271-839; 060-679-385-902-62X; 062-218-780-389-812; 068-452-604-669-157; 071-427-724-923-336; 079-615-024-387-738; 080-568-587-872-709; 083-381-011-024-36X; 083-525-115-003-950; 097-092-295-500-651; 101-467-474-763-36X; 102-362-526-374-610; 102-682-387-421-626; 105-065-409-527-284; 137-802-632-043-010; 142-677-383-560-199; 145-523-815-049-35X; 155-691-175-864-748; 161-300-804-429-199; 167-175-414-731-307; 176-314-956-781-732","22","ISABELLE BADENHAUSSER; STÉPHANE CORDEAU","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","","LENS",0,"BADENHAUSSER I, 2012, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","BADENHAUSSER I, 2012, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT"

MUCH OF THIS SNOW IS TRANSPORTED BY WIND, CAUSING SUBSTANTIAL SUBLIMATION LOSSES, WHICH ARE REDUCED BY OBSTACLES AND TOPOGRAPHIC FEATURES ON THE LANDSCAPE THAT REDUCE SNOW TRANSPORT AND TRAP SNOW. AGROFORESTRY CONFIGURATIONS TRAP SNOW AND REDUCE THE AMOUNT AND DISTANCE OF SNOW MOVEMENT AND, BECAUSE OF THIS, REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE LOST TO SUBLIMATION. THE PLANNING OF AGROFORESTRY MEASURES SHOULD THEREFORE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THEIR EFFECTS ON SNOW HYDROLOGY. IN THIS STUDY, THE EFFECTS OF SHELTERBELTS ON SNOW QUANTITY AND DISTRIBUTION ARE SHOWN OVER MULTIPLE YEARS, INCLUDING A NUMBER OF LOCATIONS IN MANITOBA AND SASKATCHEWAN. RESULTS SHOW THAT SNOW TRANSPORT REACHED EQUILIBRIUM IN 400 M OR LESS (I.E., THAT SUBLIMATION RATES WERE AT THEIR MAXIMUM BEYOND 400 M LEEWARD OF A SHELTERBELT). ALSO, IN A PAIRED LANDSCAPE INVENTORY, THE LANDSCAPE WITH SHELTERBELTS HAD 29% MORE SNOW WATER EQUIVALENT (SWE) THAN THE UNSHELTERED LANDSCAPE. SITE-SPECIFIC METEOROLOGICAL DATA WAS USED IN THE PRAIRIE BLOWING SNOW MODEL, NOW A COMPONENT OF THE COLD REGIONS HYDROLOGICAL MODEL, TO CALCULATE THE EFFECTS OF AGROFORESTRY CONFIGURATIONS ON SNOW WATER CONSERVATION. MODELED SNOW DISTRIBUTION AGREED WELL WITH MEASURED SNOW AT CONQUEST, SASKATCHEWAN, IN THE WINTER OF 2009/2010. USING ACTUAL WEATHER DATA FOR THE SAME LOCATION FOR THE PERIOD 1996–2011, THE MODEL CALCULATED THE ANNUAL SUBLIMATION FROM 200 M WIDE FIELDS PROTECTED BY SHELTERBELTS TO BE UP TO 12.5 MM LESS THAN SIMILAR UNSHELTERED FIELDS.","86","3","335","344","WATER CONSERVATION; WINDBREAK; MOISTURE; SNOW; SNOW HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SUBLIMATION (PHASE TRANSITION); BLOWING SNOW; SNOW FIELD; ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES","","","","","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10457-011-9466-4.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/103812565 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-011-9466-4 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-011-9466-4/fulltext.html","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1007/S10457-011-9466-4","","10.1007/s10457-011-9466-4","1972066109","","0","002-466-962-536-728; 014-982-658-905-919; 019-510-249-119-593; 022-648-804-684-488; 048-792-005-843-526; 053-014-710-807-301; 114-397-354-649-416; 116-163-639-330-522; 117-073-520-190-515; 128-297-520-800-75X; 162-956-431-308-084; 173-260-512-862-638","22","JOHN KORT; GARY BANK; JOHN W.

ACHIEVING THESE ECOSYSTEM SERVICE GOALS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON THEIR ABILITY TO REMOVE WATER FROM THE SOIL VIA TRANSPIRATION. IN THESE SYSTEMS, EDGES BETWEEN CROP FIELDS AND TREES OF THE BUFFER SYSTEMS CAN CREATE ADVECTION PROCESSES, WHICH COULD INFLUENCE WATER USE BY TREES. WE CONDUCTED A FIELD STUDY IN A RIPARIAN BUFFER SYSTEM ESTABLISHED IN 1994 UNDER A HUMID TEMPERATE CLIMATE, LOCATED IN THE CORN BELT REGION OF THE MIDWESTERN U.S. (IOWA). THE GOALS WERE TO ESTIMATE STAND LEVEL TRANSPIRATION BY THE RIPARIAN BUFFER, QUANTIFY THE CONTROLS ON WATER USE BY THE BUFFER SYSTEM, AND DETERMINE TO WHAT EXTENT ADVECTIVE ENERGY AND TREE POSITION WITHIN THE BUFFER SYSTEM INFLUENCE INDIVIDUAL TREE TRANSPIRATION RATES. WE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE WATER USE RESPONSE (DETERMINED WITH THE HEAT RATIO METHOD) OF ONE OF THE DOMINANT SPECIES (ACER SACCHARINUM) AND A SUBDOMINANT (JUGLANS NIGRA). A FEW INDIVIDUALS OF THREE ADDITIONAL SPECIES (QUERCUS BICOLOR, BETULA NIGRA, PLATANUS OCCIDENTALIS) WERE MONITORED OVER A SHORTER TIME PERIOD TO ASSESS THE GENERALITY OF RESPONSES. METEOROLOGICAL STATIONS WERE INSTALLED ALONG A TRANSECT ACROSS THE RIPARIAN BUFFER TO DETERMINE THE MICROCLIMATE CONDITIONS. THE DIFFERENCES FOUND AMONG INDIVIDUALS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO DIFFERENCES IN SPECIES SAP VELOCITIES AND SAPWOOD DEPTHS, LOCATION RELATIVE TO THE FOREST EDGE AND PREVAILING WINDS AND CANOPY EXPOSURE AND DOMINANCE. SAPFLOW RATES FOR A. SACCHARINUM TREES GROWING AT THE SE EDGE (PREVAILING WINDS) WERE 39% GREATER THAN SE INTERIOR TREES AND 30% AND 69% GREATER THAN NW INTERIOR AND EDGE TREES, RESPECTIVELY. NO TRANSPIRATION ENHANCEMENT DUE TO EDGE EFFECT WAS DETECTED IN THE SUBDOMINANT J. NIGRA. THE RESULTS WERE INTERPRETED AS INDICATIVE OF ADVECTION EFFECTS FROM THE SURROUNDING CROPS. FURTHER, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE DOCUMENT IN SAPFLOW RATES BETWEEN THE FIVE STUDY SPECIES, SUGGESTING THAT SELECTION OF SPECIES IS IMPORTANT FOR ENHANCING SPECIFIC RIPARIAN BUFFER FUNCTIONS. HOWEVER, MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED ON WATER USE PATTERNS AMONG DIVERSE SPECIES GROWING UNDER DIFFERENT CLIMATIC AND BIOPHYSICAL CONDITIONS TO ASSIST POLICY AND MANAGEMENT DECISIONS REGARDING EFFECTIVE BUFFER DESIGN.","261","8","1415","1427","CANOPY; RIPARIAN ZONE; TRANSPIRATION; ECOLOGY; RIPARIAN BUFFER; BUFFER ZONE; MICROCLIMATE; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SURFACE RUNOFF; FOREST ECOLOGY","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112711000594 https://works.bepress.com/richard_schultz/12/ https://works.bepress.com/richard_schultz/12/download/ https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/nrem_pubs/176/ https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70035028 http://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND44504906 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1174&context=nrem_pubs https://core.ac.uk/display/38936471 https://core.ac.uk/download/38936471.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.FORECO.2011.01.027","","10.1016/j.foreco.2011.01.027","1973003639","","0","000-933-635-218-121; 002-937-270-631-538; 004-905-391-095-299; 006-013-126-848-359; 006-301-725-524-643; 007-782-284-974-556; 007-868-997-910-082; 008-963-601-245-963; 009-550-464-053-244; 010-016-985-053-464; 014-505-740-285-710; 014-675-797-942-445; 014-869-190-986-412; 015-774-018-873-947; 015-797-434-263-656; 015-853-406-515-960; 016-820-609-156-975; 018-849-605-190-692; 019-660-983-218-24X; 028-802-252-344-012; 032-567-117-266-899; 034-438-015-172-199; 035-252-962-089-458; 036-737-756-097-520; 036-902-840-704-756; 036-972-669-332-991; 042-198-513-831-839; 044-401-317-828-273; 044-648-632-949-459; 044-913-271-610-875; 048-438-815-490-855; 048-614-212-390-003; 053-039-894-599-842; 055-845-490-503-700; 055-850-639-312-512; 056-228-092-536-366; 057-218-444-292-48X; 058-246-587-603-761; 064-239-686-824-334; 067-407-178-194-654; 069-617-966-938-050; 072-782-039-741-14X; 073-304-044-398-243; 084-835-163-576-171; 093-473-218-476-962; 096-486-715-261-497; 096-992-699-821-977; 098-872-995-549-580; 100-557-736-418-383; 101-213-200-736-866; 104-372-109-775-140; 105-776-211-113-888; 106-610-194-124-767; 108-578-084-648-864; 114-338-848-181-040; 115-642-860-718-878; 120-541-822-032-89X; 125-114-523-881-459; 126-961-510-728-424; 127-162-591-317-082; 127-873-912-506-88X; 128-446-648-309-608; 132-453-594-121-799; 134-015-929-541-174; 139-935-842-194-740; 142-178-368-818-650; 142-271-391-381-035; 142-443-085-420-962; 145-247-954-968-606; 149-362-419-662-110; 157-041-797-285-853; 166-206-159-722-288; 171-323-632-774-790; 178-282-643-794-654; 186-757-319-875-934; 190-556-196-451-472; 195-401-611-860-018; 196-532-707-381-19X","32","VIRGINIA HERNANDEZ-SANTANA; HEIDI ASBJORNSEN; THOMAS J.

DOI: 10.1111/J.1752-1688.2010.00422.X; ; ; ; ABSTRACT:  RIPARIAN FOREST BUFFERS ESTABLISHED ACCORDING TO ACCEPTED CONSERVATION PRACTICE STANDARDS HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED AS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR MITIGATING NONPOINT SOURCE POLLUTION. THE MIDWESTERN UNITED STATES IS CHARACTERIZED BY MANY KILOMETERS OF NARROW, NATURALLY OCCURRING FORESTS ALONG STREAMS. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE REMNANT FORESTS COMPARED WITH THESE NEWLY ESTABLISHED BUFFERS. THIS STUDY COMPARED THE ABILITY OF NATURALLY OCCURRING REMNANT FORESTS WITH AND WITHOUT ADJACENT PLANTED GRASS FILTERS TO BUFFER CONCENTRATED FLOW PATHS (CFPS) ORIGINATING IN CROP FIELDS ALONG FIRST- AND SECOND-ORDER STREAMS IN THREE NORTHEAST MISSOURI WATERSHEDS. REMNANT FORESTS BREACHED BY RUNOFF THROUGH CFPS WERE NARROWER THAN THOSE THAT DISPERSED 100% OF THE CFPS. REMNANT FORESTS WITH ADJACENT GRASS BUFFERS WERE NEARLY TWICE THE WIDTH AS THOSE WITHOUT GRASS FILTERS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT CFPS, WHICH DEVELOPED WITHIN REMNANT FORESTS AND AT THE BASE OF IN-FIELD GRASS WATERWAYS, WERE POTENTIAL SOURCES OF SEDIMENTS TO STREAMS. METHODS TO MITIGATE THESE CFPS WARRANT FURTHER INVESTIGATION. OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT ALTHOUGH THESE NATURAL REMNANT FORESTS PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL BUFFERING CAPACITY, BOTH IMPROVED MANAGEMENT AND/OR THE ADDITION OF AN ADJACENT GRASS FILTER WOULD IMPROVE WATER QUALITY BY REDUCING SEDIMENT LOSS TO STREAMS. INFERENCES CAN BE USED TO INFORM THE DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT OF SIMILAR CONSERVATION BUFFER SYSTEMS WITHIN THE REGION.","46","2","311","322","EROSION; RIPARIAN FOREST; WATER RESOURCES; NONPOINT SOURCE POLLUTION; WATER QUALITY; SEDIMENT; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; STREAMS; SURFACE RUNOFF","","","","","https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103134095.html https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2010.00422.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2010.00422.x/abstract https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103134095 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010JAWRA..46..311K/abstract","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1752-1688.2010.00422.X","","10.1111/j.1752-1688.2010.00422.x","2016256893","","0","000-933-635-218-121; 003-148-094-786-550; 004-274-424-425-410; 023-683-277-287-21X; 025-131-472-929-81X; 028-802-252-344-012; 030-682-084-703-597; 033-842-747-228-686; 036-466-585-417-013; 044-401-317-828-273; 044-948-727-495-773; 045-814-903-083-739; 048-513-319-982-524; 053-514-836-557-388; 059-949-847-321-259; 066-360-222-781-695; 067-656-049-341-942; 076-826-572-086-275; 080-812-176-152-098; 082-797-391-654-568; 083-619-701-060-090; 088-236-621-248-724; 101-774-056-400-814; 103-231-338-453-473; 104-207-444-130-180; 108-578-084-648-864; 111-288-588-656-115; 115-642-860-718-878; 127-438-641-898-095; 128-195-997-346-382; 131-964-178-587-619; 158-517-969-155-228; 188-800-463-494-363","34","KRIS W.

HOWEVER, OBSERVATIONAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT CONCENTRATED FLOW IS PREVALENT FROM AGRICULTURAL FIELDS. OVER TIME SEDIMENT CAN ACCUMULATE IN RIPARIAN BUFFERS FORMING BERMS THAT RESTRICT SHEET FLOW; THESE BERMS ULTIMATELY BACK UP SURFACE RUNOFF, RESULTING IN AN EVENTUAL BREAKTHROUGH THAT CONCENTRATES OVERLAND FLOW. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE OCCURRENCE OF CONCENTRATED FLOW PATHS (CFPS) IN RIPARIAN BUFFERS AT BOTH THE FIELD AND WATERSHED SCALE. AT THE FIELD SCALE, INTENSIVE TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED AT TEN FIELD SITES IN SOUTHERN ILLINOIS. TO ASSESS THE PREVALENCE OF CFPS AT THE WATERSHED SCALE, THREE WATERSHEDS IN SOUTHERN ILLINOIS WERE SELECTED FOR WALKING STREAM SURVEYS ALONG RANDOMLY SELECTED 1,000 M REACHES. CFPS WERE IDENTIFIED IN ALL TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEYS AND ALL WALKING STREAM SURVEYS. AMONG FIELD SITES, CONCENTRATED FLOW ACCOUNTED FOR 82.5–100% OF THE DRAINAGE LEAVING THE AGRICULTURAL FIELDS. SEDIMENT BERM ACCUMULATION WAS IDENTIFIED AT ALL FIELD SITES AND WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH CFP SIZE. AT THE WATERSHED SCALE, CFPS WERE MORE ABUNDANT IN AGRICULTURAL AREAS COMPARED TO FORESTED LAND. RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY INDICATE THAT CONCENTRATED FLOW WAS PREVALENT ACROSS ALL STUDY SITES AT BOTH THE FIELD AND WATERSHED SCALE.

THE STRUCTURE OF BEETLE COMMUNITIES IN THE FIRST FULL YEAR OF ESTABLISHMENT WAS FOUND TO SHOW NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TUSSOCK GRASS AND COUNTRYSIDE STEWARDSHIP MARGINS. HOWEVER, BOTH DIFFERED FROM THE FINE GRASS MARGINS, WHICH SUPPORTED LOWER OVERALL ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF BEETLES. THIS WAS ATTRIBUTED TO SMALL-SCALE ARCHITECTURAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SPECIES OF FINE AND TUSSOCK GRASSES, RATHER THAN DIFFERENCES IN PLANT COMPOSITION. BODY SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS OF BEETLES SHOWED DISTINCT SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE COUNTRYSIDE STEWARDSHIP AND TUSSOCK MARGINS. A GREATER ABUNDANCE OF LARGE BEETLES WAS FOUND IN FINE GRASS MARGINS, ALTHOUGH IN ALL CASES THESE BODY SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF SPECIES OR A TAXONOMICALLY DISTINCT GROUP. ALL THREE MARGIN TYPES INCLUDED BEETLE SPECIES OF CONSERVATION VALUE. THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE RESULTS WAS DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE VALUE OF THESE SEED MIXTURES FOR INVERTEBRATE CONVERSATION.

CARABIDS WERE SAMPLED WITH PITFALL TRAPS IN A HEDGE AND AN ADJACENT CULTIVATED FIELD DURING THE WHOLE ACTIVITY PERIOD OF THESE INSECTS TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF DISTANCE FROM THE HEDGE ON SPECIES DIVERSITY. FENCED PITFALL TRAPS WERE ALSO USED TO ESTIMATE ABSOLUTE POPULATION DENSITIES. SEVERAL DIVERSITY INDICES WERE CALCULATED AT VARIOUS SAMPLING LEVELS (TOTAL AREA, DISTANCE TREATMENT, TRAP). KENDALL'S COEFFICIENT OF RANK CORRELATION BETWEEN COMMUNITIES AT ADJACENT DISTANCES SHOWED THAT THE GREATEST CHANGES IN SPECIES RELATIVE ABUNDANCES OCCURRED CLOSE TO THE HEDGE. INDICES OF SPECIES RICHNESS, DOMINANCE CONCENTRATION, EQUITABILITY AND FISHER'S A ALL INDICATED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN SPECIES DIVERSITY WITH INCREASING DISTANCE FROM THE HEDGE. THESE TRENDS ARE EXPLAINED BY TWO COMPLEMENTARY FACTORS. FIRST, THE NUMBER OF SPECIES DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH DISTANCE FROM THE CENTRE OF THE HEDGE. SECOND, THE VARIOUS SPECIES HAD DIFFERENT SPATIAL PATTERNS OF TOTAL CAPTURE AND ABSOLUTE DENSITY. FOUR GROUPS OF SPECIES CAN THUS BE DISTINGUISHED: SPECIES RESTRICTED TO THE HEDGE, SPECIES PREFERRING THE HEDGE, SPECIES PREFERRING THE CROP, AND SPECIES UNAFFECTED BY THE HEDGE.

A GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS)-BASED TOOL WAS DEVELOPED AND TESTED THAT EMPLOYS TERRAIN ANALYSIS TO ACCOUNT FOR SPATIALLY NONUNIFORM RUNOFF AND PRODUCE MORE EFFECTIVE FILTER STRIP DESIGNS. THE COMPUTER PROGRAM, AGBUFFERBUILDER, RUNS WITH ARCGIS VERSIONS 10.0 AND 10.1 (ESRI, REDLANDS, CALIFORNIA) AND USES DIGITAL ELEVATION MODELS TO IDENTIFY DETAILED SPATIAL PATTERNS OF OVERLAND RUNOFF TO FIELD MARGINS. THE TOOL THEN SIZES FILTER DIMENSIONS ACCORDING TO THOSE PATTERNS USING BUFFER AREA RATIO RELATIONSHIPS. THE RESULTING DESIGN IS LARGER ALONG SEGMENTS WHERE MORE RUNOFF FLOWS AND SMALLER ALONG SEGMENTS WHERE RUNOFF IS LESS AND DELIVERS A CONSTANT LEVEL OF TRAPPING EFFICIENCY AROUND THE FIELD MARGIN FOR SEDIMENT AND SEDIMENT-BOUND POLLUTANTS. THE TOOL ALSO CAN ESTIMATE TRAPPING EFFICIENCY OF EXISTING FILTER STRIPS OR HYPOTHETICAL CONFIGURATIONS. IN A VALIDATION TEST, ESTIMATES OF SEDIMENT TRAPPING EFFICIENCY USING THE TOOL9S ASSESSMENT FUNCTION COMPARED CLOSELY TO MEASUREMENTS TAKEN ON LARGE FIELD PLOTS IN CENTRAL IOWA. USING AGBUFFERBUILDER, DESIGNS DEVELOPED FOR A SAMPLE OF FIELDS IN THE MIDWESTERN UNITED STATES WERE ESTIMATED TO TRAP NEARLY DOUBLE THE SEDIMENT, ON AVERAGE, DURING A DESIGN STORM THAN CONSTANT-WIDTH CONFIGURATIONS HAVING EQUIVALENT TOTAL FILTER AREA. AGBUFFERBUILDER CAN BE USED TO BOLSTER ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF FILTER STRIPS WHERE RUNOFF IS SPATIALLY NONUNIFORM.

SINCE THE 1970S, GOVERNMENTS HAVE INTRODUCED AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES (AES) AIMED AT MITIGATING THIS IMPACT, BUT INFORMATION ON THEIR SUCCESS IS LIMITED. A FIVE Y, FARM-SCALE EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF ENGLAND'S ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP AES IN ENHANCING THE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF SMALL MAMMALS (VOLES CRICETIDAE , MICE MURIDAE , AND SHREWS SORICIDAE ) IN AN INTENSIVELY-FARMED ARABLE LANDSCAPE. SMALL MAMMAL COMMUNITIES WERE SAMPLED IN SPRING AND AUTUMN ON GRASSY FIELD MARGINS INSTALLED UNDER THE ENTRY LEVEL SCHEME (ELS) TIER OF ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, WHERE 1% OF CROPPED LAND WAS CONVERTED TO WILDLIFE HABITATS. RESULTS WERE COMPARED WITH THOSE FROM FIELD MARGINS ON A SECOND, EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT (ELS EXTRA: ELSX) IN WHICH 5% OF CROPPED LAND WAS TAKEN OUT OF PRODUCTION, AND ALSO FIELD MARGINS ON A CONVENTIONALLY-FARMED CONTROL TREATMENT (‘CROSS COMPLIANCE’: CC). SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF SMALL MAMMALS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE ON ALL TREATMENTS IN SPRING AND AUTUMN. MANY INCREASES WERE GREATER ON ELS AND ELSX FIELD MARGINS COMPARED TO THE CC CONTROLS, BUT THERE WAS LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT ELSX WAS MORE BENEFICIAL THAN ELS, AND THERE WERE SPECIES-SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES. VOLES WERE NOT DETECTED ON ANY TREATMENT IN THE INITIAL SAMPLING PERIOD BUT BANK VOLES MYODES GLAREOLUS RAPIDLY BECAME ABUNDANT THEREAFTER, PARTICULARLY ON ELS AND ELSX FIELD MARGINS, AND FIELD VOLES MICROTUS AGRESTIS ALSO COLONISED. WOOD MICE APODEMUS SYLVATICUS WERE PRESENT ON ALL TREATMENTS IN ALL SAMPLING PERIODS, BUT SPRING ABUNDANCE DECLINED AS VOLE ABUNDANCE INCREASED.

YET, THE SHORT-TERM SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN GHG EMISSION IN THESE SYSTEMS IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. USING TWO TRANSECTS OF THREE STATIC CHAMBERS AT TWO NORTH CAROLINA AGRICULTURAL RIPARIAN ZONES (ONE RESTORED, ONE UNRESTORED), WE SHOW THAT ESTIMATES OF THE AVERAGE GHG FLUX AT THE SITE SCALE CAN VARY BY ONE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE MEAN OR THE MEDIAN IS USED AS A MEASURE OF CENTRAL TENDENCY. BECAUSE THE MEDIAN TENDS TO MUTE THE EFFECT OF OUTLIER POINTS (HOT SPOTS AND HOT MOMENTS), WE PROPOSE THAT BOTH MUST BE REPORTED OR THAT OTHER MORE ADVANCED SPATIAL AVERAGING TECHNIQUES (E.G., KRIGING, AREA-WEIGHTED AVERAGE) SHOULD BE USED TO ESTIMATE GHG FLUXES AT THE SITE SCALE. RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT SHORT-TERM TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN GHG FLUXES (A FEW DAYS) UNDER SEEMINGLY CONSTANT TEMPERATURE AND HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS CAN BE AS LARGE AS SPATIAL VARIABILITY AT THE SITE SCALE, SUGGESTING THAT THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY SHOULD RETHINK SAMPLING PROTOCOLS FOR GHG AT THE SOIL-ATMOSPHERE INTERFACE TO INCLUDE REPEATED MEASURES OVER SHORT PERIODS OF TIME AT SELECT CHAMBERS TO ESTIMATE GHG EMISSIONS IN THE FIELD. ALTHOUGH RECENT ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY PROVIDE TOOLS TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, THEIR COST IS OFTEN TOO HIGH FOR WIDESPREAD IMPLEMENTATION.

THE AFFORESTATION OF THESE RIPARIAN ZONES HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE CARBON (C) STORAGE IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES BY CREATING A NEW BIOMASS SINK FOR ATMOSPHERIC CO2. OCCURRING AT THE SAME TIME, THE STORAGE OF NITROGEN (N) AND PHOSPHORUS (P) IN PLANT BIOMASS, IS AN IMPORTANT WATER QUALITY FUNCTION THAT MAY GREATLY VARY WITH TYPES OF RIPARIAN VEGETATION. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY WERE (1) TO COMPARE C, N AND P STORAGE IN ABOVEGROUND, BELOWGROUND AND DETRITAL BIOMASS FOR THREE TYPES OF RIPARIAN VEGETATION COVER (9-YEAR-OLD HYBRID POPLAR BUFFERS, HERBACEOUS BUFFERS AND NATURAL WOODLOTS) ACROSS FOUR AGRICULTURAL SITES AND (2) TO DETERMINE POTENTIAL VEGETATION COVER EFFECTS ON SOIL NUTRIENT SUPPLY RATE IN THE RIPARIAN ZONE. SITE LEVEL COMPARISONS SUGGEST THAT 9-YEAR-OLD POPLAR BUFFERS HAVE STORED 9E31 TIMES MORE BIOMASS C, 4E10 TIMES MORE BIOMASS N, AND 3E7 TIMES MORE BIOMASS P THAN ADJACENT NON MANAGED HERBACEOUS BUFFERS, WITH THE LARGEST DIFFERENCES OBSERVED ON THE MORE FERTILE SITES. THE CONVERSION OF THESE HERBACEOUS BUFFERS TO POPLAR BUFFERS COULD RESPECTIVELY INCREASE C, N AND P STORAGE IN BIOMASS BY 3.2E11.9 T/HA/YR, 32E124 KG/ HA/YR AND 3.2E15.6 KG/HA/YR, OVER 9 YEARS. SOIL NO3 AND P SUPPLY RATES DURING THE SUMMER WERE RESPECTIVELY 57% AND 66% LOWER IN POPLAR BUFFERS THAN IN ADJACENT HERBACEOUS BUFFERS, POTENTIALLY REFLECTING DIFFERENCES IN NUTRIENT STORAGE AND CYCLING BETWEEN THE TWO BUFFER TYPES. BIOMASS C RANGED 49 E160 T/HA IN WOODLOTS, 33E110 T/HA IN POPLAR BUFFERS AND 3E4 T/HA IN HERBACEOUS BUFFERS. SIMILAR BIOMASS C STOCKS WERE FOUND IN THE MOST PRODUCTIVE POPLAR BUFFER AND THREE OF THE FOUR WOODLOTS STUDIED. GIVEN THEIR LARGE AND VARIED BIOMASS C STOCKS, CONSERVATION OF OLDER RIPARIAN WOODLOTS IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT FOR C BALANCE MANAGEMENT IN FARMLAND. IN ADDITION, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF POPLAR BUFFERS, IN REPLACEMENT OF NON MANAGED HERBACEOUS BUFFERS, COULD RAPIDLY INCREASE BIOMASS C, N AND P STORAGE ALONG FARM STREAMS, WHICH WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR WATER QUALITY PROTECTION AND GLOBAL CHANGE MITIGATION. © 2015 THE AUTHORS.

IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO LARGELY ELIMINATE NATURAL RESOURCE DEGENERATION THROUGH JUDICIOUS APPLICATION OF ON-FARM CONSERVATION PRACTICES. FARMERS HAVE LITTLE ECONOMIC INCENTIVE TO CONSERVE BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO PREVIOUS RESEARCH, MOST CONSERVATION TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE UNPROFITABLE. THE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH INTO THREE ALTERNATIVE TYPES OF CONSERVATION PRACTICES FOR THIS STUDY CONFIRMS THAT TWO (CONSERVATION CROPS AND RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIPS) PROVIDE FOR NET COSTS TO FARMERS, AND THAT THE THIRD (CONSERVATION SOIL TILLAGE) IS NOT PROFITABLE UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. AT THE SAME TIME, THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT TWO OUT OF THE THREE SETS OF PRACTICES, NAMELY RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIPS AND CONSERVATION TILLAGE, CAN BE ECONOMICALLY BENEFICIAL TO SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT SOCIETY, AS ECONOMIC GAINERS, SHOULD OFFER COMPENSATION TO FARMERS AS ECONOMIC LOSERS. THIS STUDY FURTHERMORE ESTABLISHES THAT NOT ALL CONSERVATION PRACTICES THAT RESULT IN REDUCED SOIL EROSION WILL LEAD TO DECREASED SEDIMENT AND PHOSPHORUS LOADINGS INTO WATERCOURSES; THAT NOT ALL REDUCED SEDIMENT AND PHOSPHORUS LOADINGS LEAD TO IMPROVED WATER QUALITY; AND THAT, EVEN WHERE AN IMPROVEMENT TO WATER QUALITY IN CHEMICAL, PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND AESTHETIC TERMS CAN BE OBTAINED, THE COSTS TO SOCIETY OF ACHIEVING IMPROVEMENT MAY EXCEED THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS. SUCH OUTCOMES CAN READILY PROMOTE DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND ECOLOGISTS ON THE ONE HAND AND SOCIO-ECONOMISTS ON THE OTHER.

HENCE, DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENT REQUIRES A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE CHANGES, ESPECIALLY FOR FUNCTIONALLY IMPORTANT ORGANISMS SUCH AS HOVERFLIES BENEFITING FROM FLOWERING PLANTS.; ; 2.  WE EXAMINED HOVERFLY (DIPTERA: SYRPHIDAE) COMMUNITIES IN BROAD AND NARROW SOWN FLOWER STRIPS, IN NATURALLY DEVELOPED GRASSY STRIPS AND IN WHEAT FIELDS (AS A CONTROL). WE ALSO INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF THESE FOUR HABITAT TYPES ON SYRPHID OCCURRENCE IN THE ADJACENT WHEAT FIELDS.; ; 3.  THE RELATIVE INFLUENCE OF LOCAL VS. LANDSCAPE EFFECTS WAS TESTED BY SELECTING STUDY SITES ALONG A GRADIENT OF STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY FROM SIMPLE LANDSCAPES (∼100% ARABLE LAND) TO COMPLEX LANDSCAPES (UP TO 70% SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS SUCH AS FALLOWS, FIELD MARGINS, HEDGES AND GRASSLAND). LANDSCAPE COMPLEXITY WAS ASSESSED WITHIN LANDSCAPE SECTORS OF 0·5–4·0 KM RADIUS AROUND STRIPS.; ; 4.  SYRPHID DENSITY AND IN PARTICULAR, THE DENSITY OF APHIDOPHAGOUS SPECIES, WAS HIGHER IN NARROW AND BROAD SOWN FLOWER STRIPS COMPARED TO GRASSY STRIPS AND WHEAT–WHEAT BOUNDARY CONTROLS AT THE MILK-RIPENING STAGE OF THE WHEAT. IN ADDITION, SPECIES RICHNESS OF APHIDOPHAGOUS SYRPHIDS WITHIN WHEAT FIELDS ADJACENT TO BROAD SOWN FLOWER STRIPS WAS HIGHER AT THE WHEAT PEAK-RIPENING STAGE. THIS INDICATES A SPILLOVER BETWEEN HABITATS AND A POSITIVE EFFECT OF THESE SOWN FLOWER STRIPS ON POTENTIAL BIOCONTROL OF CEREAL APHIDS. FLOWER DENSITIES AND SYRPHID DIVERSITY AND DENSITY, RESPECTIVELY, WERE CLOSELY RELATED.; ; 5.  SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE IN THE SOWN FLOWER STRIPS INCREASED AS THE PROPORTION OF ARABLE LAND IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE INCREASED, SUGGESTING THAT WITHIN STRUCTURALLY SIMPLE LANDSCAPES (AT 0·5–1 KM RADIUS AROUND THE SITES) SYRPHID FLIES CONCENTRATED ON THE MOST REWARDING RESOURCES WITHIN THE SOWN FLOWER STRIPS. SOWN FLOWER STRIPS WERE MORE EFFECTIVE AT INCREASING SYRPHID SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE IN SIMPLE LANDSCAPES, PRESUMABLY BECAUSE THE CREATION OF FLOWER RESOURCES MADE THE GREATEST DIFFERENCE IN SUCH HOMOGENEOUS, INTENSIVELY MANAGED ARABLE LANDSCAPES.; ; 6.  SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES SHOULD TAKE THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS INTO ACCOUNT WHEN CONSIDERING USING SOWN FLOWER STRIPS TO ENHANCE SYRPHID DENSITY AND DIVERSITY, AND THEIR BIOCONTROL FUNCTION, IN ARABLE LANDSCAPES. CREATING LOCALLY SUCH FLOWER STRIPS IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN SIMPLE LANDSCAPES CONTAINING A HIGH PROPORTION OF ARABLE LAND, WHILE IN COMPLEX LANDSCAPES, KEEPING THE OVERALL DIVERSITY IS IMPORTANT.","46","5","1106","1114","BIODIVERSITY; ECOLOGY; POPULATION DENSITY; GRASSLAND; HOVERFLY; SPECIES RICHNESS; SPECIES DIVERSITY; ARABLE LAND; ABUNDANCE (ECOLOGY); BIOLOGY","","","","","https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01685.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01685.x https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093298822 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01685.x/abstract https://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND44267099 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20093298822.html https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01685.x https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/766417 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01685.x","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1365-2664.2009.01685.X","","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01685.x","2112090623","","0","000-421-021-678-271; 004-916-984-876-81X; 008-225-619-668-580; 008-821-738-651-977; 010-945-646-716-071; 011-508-246-956-659; 011-672-108-275-761; 012-267-243-122-028; 013-367-327-282-701; 013-539-528-365-106; 015-796-697-992-282; 020-822-904-372-092; 021-456-573-673-200; 022-392-117-877-556; 022-771-502-946-159; 025-117-138-466-353; 027-405-522-971-388; 029-579-901-365-591; 030-240-600-484-24X; 033-118-437-839-732; 035-691-308-793-277; 038-714-740-525-771; 042-749-789-102-563; 045-924-425-733-406; 048-575-981-800-661; 050-985-622-056-969; 052-272-715-378-177; 053-505-331-627-489; 054-274-474-416-858; 056-101-024-270-22X; 056-822-231-800-190; 062-036-445-726-722; 062-218-780-389-812; 062-554-425-020-511; 068-730-938-041-13X; 070-194-102-378-889; 070-573-740-499-634; 072-817-046-222-302; 075-182-328-430-399; 080-035-418-642-978; 080-094-470-063-850; 082-117-114-903-173; 086-402-015-642-906; 090-682-458-827-532; 093-255-909-243-759; 096-920-887-442-138; 098-312-271-690-700; 099-545-753-107-454; 101-226-492-644-199; 103-348-929-033-891; 105-301-641-863-030; 113-738-969-445-037; 115-537-551-650-895; 123-831-368-241-900; 127-699-601-161-529; 133-272-860-021-373; 135-162-787-756-896; 148-203-562-421-657; 148-510-873-134-137; 152-041-007-966-282; 155-983-720-842-240; 159-540-954-848-947; 161-072-580-272-396; 166-248-084-772-47X; 168-891-232-106-045; 184-899-964-527-087; 189-171-337-953-001; 198-970-927-454-349","167","SEBASTIAN HAENKE; BARBARA E.

THEIR EFFECTS ON BIODIVERSITY HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED AT LOCAL SCALES IN TERMS OF AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES AND MANAGEMENT OF UNCULTIVATED ELEMENTS, MORE THAN AT THE LANDSCAPE LEVEL. THE HIGHEST DIVERSITY OF AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE FOUND IN BRITTANY (FRANCE) IS CHARACTERISED BY HEDGEROWS SURROUNDING ARABLE FIELDS AND PERMANENT GRASSLANDS. SOME AREAS DID NOT CHANGE MUCH OVER A FEW DECADES, WHILE OTHERS WERE TOTALLY TRANSFORMED BY AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION, FIELD ENLARGEMENT AND REMOVAL OF HEDGES. THE PRESENT PAPER AIMED AT EXAMINING IF THIS LANDSCAPE CONTEXT AFFECTED CARABID BEETLES COMMUNITIES IN HEDGEROWS. IN 11 SITES OF 1 KM 2 EACH, LAND USE DIVERSITY AND HETEROGENEITY, HEDGEROW CONNECTIVITY AND LANDSCAPE OPENNESS WERE MEASURED. CARABID BEETLES SAMPLED IN HEDGEROWS WERE IDENTIFIED TO SPECIES, AND GROUPED IN FUNCTIONAL UNITS. MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES WERE USED TO RELATE THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF INSECTS TO DIFFERENT PARAMETERS OF LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE. THE RESULTS SHOW A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AND CARABID COMMUNITIES. FOREST SPECIES WERE MORE ABUNDANT IN DENSE HEDGEROW NETWORKS WITH A RELATIVELY HIGH RATIO OF PERMANENT GRASSLANDS. LANDSCAPE OPENING INDUCED A SHIFT IN SPECIES COMPOSITION; THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF LARGE SPECIES DECREASED WHILE SMALL, MOBILE AND MORE UBIQUITOUS SPECIES WERE FAVOURED. TWO TRAJECTORIES OF LANDSCAPE CHANGE WERE IDENTIFIED, WHICH LED TO DIFFERENT RESPONSES IN COMMUNITIES, THE INCREASE IN MAIZE FOR MILK PRODUCTION OPENING THE LANDSCAPE FAR MORE THAN CEREAL CROPS ASSOCIATED WITH INDUSTRIAL PIG OR POULTRY PRODUCTION.

THE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF BUTTERFLIES ON EXPANDED-WIDTH UNCROPPED ARABLE FIELD EDGES, WHICH WERE SUBJECT TO 10 CONTRASTING, EXPERIMENTAL MANAGEMENT REGIMES, WERE MEASURED USING TRANSECTS IN 1989, 1990 AND 1991. THE EFFECTS OF THE MANAGEMENT REGIMES ON A NUMBER OF BOTANICAL VARIABLES, LIKELY TO BE OF IMPORTANCE TO BUTTERFLIES, WERE MEASURED. 2. ON THE EXPERIMENTAL FIELD EDGES, BUTTERFLY ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS FLUCTUATED BETWEEN YEARS AND PEAKED AT DIFFERENT TIMES EACH YEAR. 3. BUTTERFLY ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS DIFFERED BETWEEN EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS. PLOTS WHICH WERE EITHER CUT IN THE SPRING AND AUTUMN, OR NOT CUT AT ALL, ATTRACTED MORE INDIVIDUALS AND SPECIES OF BUTTERFLY THAN DID PLOTS CUT IN THE SUMMER. SOWING WITH A GRASS AND WILD FLOWER SEED MIXTURE INCREASED BUTTERFLY ABUNDANCE. BUTTERFLY ABUNDANCE DECLINED ON SWARDS SPRAYED ONCE ANNUALLY WITH HERBICIDE. 4. MOWING, SOWING AND SPRAYING HAD SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON MEAN FLOWER ABUNDANCE, ON THE ANNUAL AND PERENNIAL COMPONENTS FLOWERING IN THE SWARD, AND ON THE ABUNDANCE OF COMMONLY USED NECTAR SOURCES AND LARVAL HOST-PLANTS. 5. STEPWISE MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSES ON BUTTERFLY AND PLANT DATA SHOWED THAT THE ABUNDANCE OF ADULTS OF MOST BUTTERFLY SPECIES WAS MOST CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ABUNDANCE OF FLOWERS OF KEY NECTAR SOURCE SPECIES. 6. THE RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO RESOURCE PROVISION FOR LARVAL AND ADULT BUTTERFLY STAGES. RECOMMENDATIONS (EMBOLDENED IN THE TEXT) ARE MADE FOR THE CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT OF BUTTERFLIES ON ARABLE FARMLAND.","33","5","1191","1205","NECTAR SOURCE; NECTAR; ECOLOGY; PERENNIAL PLANT; BUTTERFLY; SPECIES RICHNESS; TRANSECT; ARABLE LAND; ABUNDANCE (ECOLOGY); BIOLOGY","","","","","https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/30021983830","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.2307/2404698","","10.2307/2404698","2078686117","","0","000-871-512-486-723; 001-051-404-142-811; 005-937-930-073-754; 008-291-852-239-016; 017-536-261-562-232; 025-100-472-894-109; 029-753-827-927-824; 031-216-949-664-784; 038-142-571-801-93X; 044-309-978-861-992; 045-335-685-364-955; 048-443-302-315-740; 052-025-744-277-895; 064-208-989-079-835; 077-623-747-437-53X; 085-623-574-785-930; 098-969-872-698-050; 134-928-445-804-712; 153-133-055-256-546; 189-197-094-615-125","193","RUTH E.

THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY WERE TO ESTABLISH THE CONTRIBUTION OF NARROW RIPARIAN HABITAT STRIPS TO PLANT BIODIVERSITY IN FARMING LANDSCAPE AND TO DOCUMENT WHETHER THEY COULD BE RESERVOIR OF WEEDS DETRIMENTAL TO AGRICULTURE. TWENTY-NINE SECTIONS (>400 M) OF RIPARIAN HABITATS ADJACENT TO CROPFIELDS WERE INVENTORIED IN SUMMER 1996 AND SPRING 1997, AND THESE WERE GROUPED INTO FIVE VEGETATION TYPES: (1) HERBACEOUS STRIPS DOMINATED BY GRASSES AND DEVOID OF WOODY SPECIES, (2) HERBACEOUS STRIPS DOMINATED BY FORBS ALSO DEVOID OF WOODY SPECIES, (3) STRIPS WITH SMALL ( 10 M). A TOTAL OF 280 (228 HERBACEOUS AND 52 WOODY) PLANT SPECIES WERE RECORDED. OVERALL HABITATS WITH TREES CONTAINED A LARGER NUMBER OF HERB AND WOODY SPECIES THAN OTHER RIPARIAN HABITATS. HOWEVER, THIS WAS NOT REFLECTED IN THE SPECIES RICHNESS PER UNIT AREA (QUADRATS) WHICH MEANT THAT HABITATS WITH TREES WERE MORE HETEROGENEOUS THAN OTHER HABITAT TYPES. SPECIES COMPOSITION DIFFERED CONSIDERABLY AMONG THE VARIOUS RIPARIAN HABITATS WHEN CONSIDERING FOREST SPRING EPHEMERALS, FERNS, FORBS IN GENERAL, GRASSES AND WOODY VEGETATION. SUBSTANTIALLY MORE NATIVE WETLAND SPECIES (OBLIGATE AND FACULTATIVE) WERE RECORDED ADJACENT TO WATERCOURSES THAN NEAR FIELDS. MORE WEEDY AND IN PARTICULAR, INTRODUCED SPECIES, WERE FOUND IN QUADRATS SAMPLED NEAR CROPFIELDS. ALTHOUGH NO PLANT SPECIES OF SPECIAL CONSERVATION VALUE WERE LOCATED IN THE RIPARIAN HABITATS, THEY SHOULD DESERVE SPECIAL PROTECTION IN INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL AREAS BECAUSE THEY HARBOUR A SUITE OF WETLAND PLANTS (AND ANIMALS) NOT FOUND IN OTHER FARMLAND HABITATS. THIS APPEARS TO BE ESPECIALLY DESIRABLE FOR THOSE HABITATS WITH A WELL-DEVELOPED WOODY VEGETATION.","94","1","73","87","RIPARIAN ZONE; WOODY PLANT; BIODIVERSITY; FORB; VEGETATION; INTRODUCED SPECIES; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; SPECIES RICHNESS","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880902000142","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/S0167-8809(02)00014-2","","10.1016/s0167-8809(02)00014-2","2064995277","","0","000-040-937-274-69X; 003-054-551-205-858; 004-807-568-531-692; 007-361-282-044-640; 010-083-294-693-008; 012-335-108-074-344; 013-960-910-763-50X; 014-322-432-919-02X; 015-863-314-524-72X; 015-983-230-964-804; 020-360-071-779-440; 020-408-098-790-113; 021-187-528-186-865; 021-933-813-475-043; 026-825-605-796-532; 029-105-025-347-654; 031-712-522-366-166; 033-965-464-922-934; 035-187-836-476-838; 036-722-726-289-60X; 038-659-320-814-260; 039-208-787-164-04X; 043-062-864-287-955; 046-529-848-837-393; 047-546-677-833-03X; 047-800-573-929-302; 051-197-969-663-775; 053-632-634-794-921; 055-777-094-247-213; 056-853-622-256-040; 058-218-489-015-546; 060-474-216-383-073; 063-003-550-683-547; 068-143-605-669-192; 068-933-096-514-243; 082-856-470-932-156; 083-292-483-412-825; 083-665-162-525-30X; 084-744-111-694-770; 088-470-568-990-908; 091-707-812-404-482; 093-484-061-728-036; 096-074-282-606-638; 104-230-077-662-702; 105-658-519-498-107; 108-007-092-968-56X; 108-604-669-561-218; 111-977-258-540-965; 112-148-110-351-322; 128-157-492-794-65X; 134-475-232-519-759; 137-827-292-132-666; 138-300-583-506-58X; 145-199-506-693-553; 150-494-637-604-381; 152-908-202-983-300; 154-750-119-428-838; 155-555-776-794-70X; 156-624-196-949-616; 158-345-384-701-811; 170-230-483-322-002; 174-769-391-601-877; 176-481-005-284-747","62","CÉLINE BOUTIN; BENOÎT JOBIN; LUC BÉLANGER","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","","LENS",0,"BOUTIN C, 2003, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","BOUTIN C, 2003, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT"

SOIL CORES WERE COLLECTED IN PLASTIC TUBES INSERTED INSIDE THE METAL SOIL PROBE. SOILS WERE SEGREGATED BY HORIZONS, AND ROOTS WERE SEPARATED INTO THREE DIAMETER CLASSES (0–1, 1–2, >2 MM) BY SOIL HORIZON. ROOT LENGTH WAS DETERMINED USING A FLATBED SCANNER ASSISTED WITH COMPUTER SOFTWARE. BUFFER TREATMENTS (167 CM/100 CM3) HAD 4.5 TIMES HIGHER RLD AS COMPARED TO PASTURE TREATMENTS (37.3 CM/100 CM3). THE AGB TREATMENT HAD THE HIGHEST (173.5 CM/100 CM3) RLD AND CG PASTURE HAD THE LOWEST (10.8 CM/100 CM3) VALUE. ROOT CARBON WAS ABOUT 3% HIGHER FOR THE BUFFERS COMPARED TO RG TREATMENT.

AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION AND LOSS OF WILD FLORAL RESOURCES RANK AMONG THE MAIN FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS DECLINE. LANDSCAPE ENHANCEMENT OF FLORAL RESOURCES HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS AN AGRO-ENVIRONMENTAL SCHEME INTENDED TO PROVIDE HONEYBEES WITH COMPENSATORY FOOD SOURCES IN INTENSIVE AGROSYSTEMS. FLORAL SCHEME EFFICIENCY HAS RARELY BEEN EVALUATED WITH RESPECT TO LANDSCAPE CONTEXT. IN THIS STUDY, WE DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED A MODELING TOOL TO DELINEATE THE LANDSCAPE AREAS LIKELY TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER EFFICIENCY OF FLORAL ENHANCEMENT SCHEMES. IN PARTICULAR, THE PROXIMITY OF SOME LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS USED BY HONEYBEES, EITHER AS FORAGING HABITAT OR AS VISUAL LANDMARK FOR ORIENTATION, MAY PARTLY DETERMINE FLORAL SCHEME EFFICIENCY. WE INVESTIGATED THIS ISSUE USING RESOURCE SELECTION FUNCTIONS (RSFS), I.E. MODELS THAT AIM TO PREDICT THE OCCURRENCE OF FORAGING HONEYBEES AT FLORAL PATCHES AS A FUNCTION OF THE PRESENCE OF KEYSTONE LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS IN THEIR PROXIMITY. HOWEVER, DECIDING WHICH LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS ARE EFFECTIVELY IN THE PROXIMITY OR NOT IS MOSTLY A MATTER OF SUBJECTIVITY. THE NOVELTY OF OUR APPROACH RESIDES IN ITS USE OF A DISTANCE-WEIGHTING FUNCTION TO EXPLICITLY ACCOUNT FOR THE SPATIAL LOCATION OF SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS. IN THAT RESPECT, A DISTANCE FUNCTION SHOULD BE SCALED ON MOVEMENT PATTERNS OF FORAGING ORGANISMS. HEREIN, WE INFERRED MOVEMENT PATTERNS FROM THE AUTOCORRELATIVE PROPERTIES OF HONEYBEE FORAGING ACTIVITY. THIS MODELING APPROACH WAS DEVELOPED ON PHACELIA (PHACELIA TANACETIFOLIA) FIELD MARGIN STRIPS, A TYPICAL “HONEYBEE-FRIENDLY” FLORAL SCHEME. A FORAGING SURVEY CONDUCTED ON 170 PHACELIA PLOTS (2 M × 2 M) FROM 17 PHACELIA STRIPS, ALL POSITIONED WITHIN THE FORAGING RANGE OF AN EXPERIMENTAL APIARY, REVEALED THAT (I) THE FLORAL SCHEME EFFICIENCY IS POSITIVELY INFLUENCED BY THE PRESENCE OF LINEAR LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS SUCH AS HEDGEROWS AND FOREST EDGES, BUT NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE PRESENCE OF ALTERNATIVE FLORAL RESOURCES, AND THAT (II) WEIGHTING THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS BY INCORPORATING A DISTANCE FUNCTION INTO MODELS CONSIDERABLY IMPROVED THEIR PREDICTIVE POWER. THIS MODELING TOOL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HELP LAND MANAGERS OPTIMIZING THEIR FINANCIAL INVESTMENT BY AVOIDING LOW-EFFICIENCY LANDSCAPE AREAS, OR FAVORING HIGH-EFFICIENCY ONES, AT THE TIME OF PLANNING FLORAL ENHANCEMENT SCHEMES.","225","","103","114","SPATIAL ANALYSIS; FORAGING; RESOURCE (BIOLOGY); HABITAT; ECOLOGY; PHACELIA TANACETIFOLIA; PHACELIA; CONTEXT (LANGUAGE USE); SCALE (MAP); BIOLOGY","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380011005448 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecomod/v225y2012icp103-114.html","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.ECOLMODEL.2011.11.015","","10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.11.015","2051630109","","0","000-630-648-290-28X; 004-795-863-113-922; 008-225-619-668-580; 009-361-087-991-944; 010-225-312-935-498; 011-113-313-615-090; 011-418-694-824-781; 012-267-243-122-028; 018-442-796-237-224; 020-257-178-016-86X; 021-032-467-070-896; 022-321-534-473-933; 027-001-115-615-588; 031-007-699-396-56X; 032-502-062-020-869; 032-555-988-750-59X; 033-753-016-098-051; 034-333-107-858-752; 037-649-247-809-59X; 040-572-453-396-234; 041-600-530-288-483; 051-038-371-024-727; 054-328-419-977-493; 054-757-028-284-265; 056-099-523-856-735; 060-190-757-297-843; 061-676-114-857-225; 063-809-373-703-852; 066-580-174-554-918; 070-511-664-279-985; 074-162-652-768-805; 076-307-235-228-944; 081-588-490-733-096; 081-887-221-003-909; 082-594-769-377-348; 083-170-367-313-074; 083-890-181-161-186; 085-507-496-811-84X; 085-590-323-362-839; 088-921-085-034-823; 095-522-959-685-498; 103-916-155-858-365; 107-188-835-457-613; 120-524-273-028-868; 145-127-779-375-427; 145-886-795-701-55X; 154-978-657-665-321; 157-188-990-173-112; 178-204-705-823-673; 184-899-964-527-087; 195-618-519-387-640","33","MICKAËL HENRY; MARIE FRÖCHEN; JULIE MAILLET-MEZERAY; ELISABETH BREYNE; FABRICE ALLIER; JEAN-FRANÇOIS ODOUX; AXEL DECOURTYE","ECOLOGICAL MODELLING","ECOLOGICAL MODELLING","","LENS",0,"HENRY M, 2012, ECOLOGICAL MODELLING","HENRY M, 2012, ECOLOGICAL MODELLING"

ADSORPTION-DESORPTION OF ESA AND OA IN VEGETATED FILTER STRIP SOIL (VFSS) HAS NOT BEEN EVALUATED, YET THESE DATA ARE REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE MOBILITY OF THESE COMPOUNDS IN VFSS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS EXPERIMENT WAS TO COMPARE METOLACHLOR, ESA, AND OA ADSORPTION AND DESORPTION PARAMETERS BETWEEN VFSS AND CULTIVATED SOIL (CS). ADSORPTION AND DESORPTION ISOTHERMS WERE DETERMINED USING THE BATCH EQUILIBRIUM PROCEDURE. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A 1.7-FOLD INCREASE IN ORGANIC CARBON CONTENT IN THE VFSS, THE EVALUATED CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SOILS WERE SIMILAR. SORPTION COEFFICIENTS FOR METOLACHLOR WERE 88% HIGHER IN VFSS THAN IN CS. IN CONTRAST, SORPTION COEFFICIENTS FOR ESA AND OA WERE NOT DIFFERENT BETWEEN SOILS. RELATIVE TO METOLACHLOR, SORPTION COEFFICIENTS FOR ESA AND OA WERE AT LEAST 79% LOWER IN BOTH SOILS. METOLACHLOR DESORPTION COEFFICIENTS WERE 59% HIGHER IN THE VFSS THAN IN THE CS. DESORPTION COEFFICIENTS FOR ESA AND OA WERE NOT DIFFERENT BETWEEN SOILS. RELATIVE TO METOLACHLOR, DESORPTION COEFFICIENTS FOR ESA AND OA WERE AT LEAST 66% LOWER IN BOTH SOILS. THESE DATA INDICATE THAT THE MOBILITY OF ESA AND OA WILL BE GREATER THAN METOLACHLOR IN BOTH SOILS.

THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PRAIRIE FILTER STRIPS (PFS) IN REMOVING NUTRIENTS FROM CROPLAND RUNOFF IN 12 SMALL WATERSHEDS IN CENTRAL IOWA. FOUR TREATMENTS WITH PFS OF DIFFERENT SPATIAL COVERAGE AND DISTRIBUTION (NO-PFS, 10% PFS, 10% PFS WITH STRIPS, AND 20% PFS WITH STRIPS) WERE ARRANGED IN A BALANCED INCOMPLETE BLOCK DESIGN ACROSS FOUR BLOCKS IN 2007. A NO-TILLAGE TWO-YEAR CORN (ZEA MAYS L.) –SOYBEAN (GLYCINE MAX [L.] MERR.) ROTATION WAS GROWN IN ROW-CROPPED AREAS BEGINNING IN 2007. RUNOFF WAS MONITORED BY H FLUMES, AND RUNOFF WATER SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED DURING THE GROWING SEASONS TO DETERMINE CONCENTRATIONS OF NITRATE-NITROGEN (NO3-N), TOTAL NITROGEN (TN) AND TOTAL PHOSPHORUS (TP) THROUGH 2011. OVERALL, THE PRESENCE OF PFS REDUCED MEAN ANNUAL NO3-N, TN, AND TP CONCENTRATIONS BY 35%, 73%, AND 82%, RESPECTIVELY, AND REDUCED ANNUAL NO3-N, TN, AND TP LOSSES BY 67%, 84%, AND 90%, RESPECTIVELY. HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT AND DISTRIBUTION OF PFS HAD NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON RUNOFF AND NUTRIENT YIELDS. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT UTILIZATION OF PFS AT THE FOOTSLOPE POSITION OF ANNUAL ROW CROP SYSTEMS PROVIDES AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO REDUCING NUTRIENT LOSS IN RUNOFF FROM SMALL AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS.","69","1","54","64","FILTER (AQUARIUM); GROWING SEASON; NUTRIENT; AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM; ROW CROP; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SURFACE RUNOFF; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; AGRONOMY","","","","","https://core.ac.uk/display/38933390 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/abe_eng_pubs/596/ https://works.bepress.com/matthew_helmers/92/ https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1881&context=abe_eng_pubs https://www.jswconline.org/content/69/1/54 https://www.srs.fs.fed.us/pubs/46921 https://www.fs.fed.us/nrs/pubs/jrnl/2014/nrs_2014_zhou-x_001.pdf https://srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/46921 https://www.jswconline.org/lookup/doi/10.2489/jswc.69.1.54 https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/46921 https://core.ac.uk/download/38933390.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.2489/JSWC.69.1.54","","10.2489/jswc.69.1.54","2132108269","","0","002-430-400-638-330; 002-937-270-631-538; 003-148-094-786-550; 005-046-617-641-306; 006-715-296-348-046; 007-375-632-321-925; 018-103-292-961-116; 019-057-578-554-139; 025-714-041-289-368; 028-802-252-344-012; 030-682-084-703-597; 032-034-540-734-416; 036-788-465-020-398; 045-878-014-461-966; 050-040-531-606-168; 051-438-305-703-476; 055-192-571-710-917; 062-103-832-699-020; 066-727-776-146-130; 070-043-160-900-85X; 076-826-572-086-275; 078-870-777-882-17X; 086-154-086-081-122; 087-680-309-241-290; 088-017-310-971-747; 092-525-270-344-68X; 092-819-620-241-167; 100-294-657-477-930; 101-436-533-216-728; 110-163-690-092-234; 123-324-136-415-020; 126-961-510-728-424; 146-606-352-041-123; 164-778-477-702-099; 196-381-785-440-137","62","XIAOBO ZHOU; MATTHEW J.

ALTHOUGH TOTAL SPECIES RICH- NESS (ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE) DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER AMONG HABITAT TYPES, WE FOUND SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SPECIES NUMBERS IN SWA THAN IN WHEAT FIELDS ADJOINING SWA AND GRASSY MARGINS WHEN THE NUMBER OF RECORDED SPECIES WAS STANDARDIZED TO THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS (RAREFACTION). CARABID ASSEMBLAGES IN WHEAT FIELDS DIFFERED FROM ASSEMBLAGES IN ADJOINING SWA AND GRASSY MARGINS. 4 THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS TO DIVERSIFY THE SPRING CARABID FAUNA IN AGROECOSYSTEMS. IN PARTICULAR, SWA WERE SHOWN TO BE USEFUL TO ENHANCE CARABID BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION IN AGROECOSYSTEMS, RATHER THAN TO ENHANCE THEIR DENSITY-DEPENDENT FUNCTIONS.","17","4","355","365","FAUNA; BIODIVERSITY; RAREFACTION (ECOLOGY); HABITAT; ECOLOGY; WILDFLOWER; SPECIES RICHNESS; AGROECOSYSTEM; ARABLE LAND; BIOLOGY","","","","AUSTRIAN ASSOCIATION FOR MIDDLE EAST; VINZENZ-SCHUMY-STIFTUNG","https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153377442 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/afe.12115 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas_Frank4/publication/254214609_Species_Diversity_of_Ground_Beetles_(Carabidae)_in_Sown_Weed_Strips_and_Adjacent_Fields/links/558275b208ae12bde6e4c0ed.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/AFE.12115","","10.1111/afe.12115","2106917172","","0","002-237-159-846-242; 003-557-159-421-139; 005-166-952-755-905; 009-289-978-013-534; 010-481-775-420-493; 010-487-532-260-285; 013-526-378-431-354; 014-420-425-932-76X; 014-475-770-713-515; 016-052-929-723-298; 019-123-430-272-496; 020-550-742-896-582; 023-486-208-338-439; 031-579-378-413-334; 031-987-261-230-852; 034-281-941-035-983; 034-452-963-737-55X; 036-259-010-837-779; 037-002-778-558-737; 039-081-329-626-678; 043-940-041-145-856; 051-103-549-479-234; 053-505-331-627-489; 054-035-841-038-29X; 056-822-231-800-190; 056-892-630-404-500; 058-105-561-757-413; 059-371-269-701-410; 061-825-091-176-860; 062-766-280-342-804; 064-717-657-434-648; 064-893-774-544-494; 066-033-171-769-128; 067-639-922-939-929; 068-452-604-669-157; 072-243-200-215-136; 073-332-568-126-247; 076-729-975-056-738; 082-141-530-704-392; 084-932-304-217-75X; 091-355-794-203-313; 093-275-781-286-407; 095-662-270-254-510; 096-497-658-401-644; 098-575-226-696-438; 106-064-719-158-957; 108-360-492-320-399; 114-646-769-502-277; 126-422-348-422-052; 126-939-277-464-686; 133-252-955-828-163; 142-547-556-180-595; 145-523-815-049-35X; 150-761-385-310-830; 156-820-343-234-249; 163-430-104-815-820; 173-731-784-504-55X; 184-170-583-035-963","12","MUHAMMAD ANJUM‐ZUBAIR; MARTIN H.

BREEDING BIRD COMMUNITIES IN HEDGEROWS AND WOODLAND IN LOWLAND ENGLAND AND WALES WERE COMPARED IN TERMS OF SPECIES RICHNESS AND SIMILARITY OF SPECIES COMPOSITION. THE PREFERENCE OF INDIVIDUAL SPECIES FOR HEDGEROWS AND WOODLAND WAS ALSO ASSESSED. THE DATA WERE DRAWN FROM 33 FARMLAND AND 35 WOODLAND COMMON BIRDS CENSUS PLOTS FOR 3 YEARS: 1990, 1993 AND 1996. WOODLAND PLOTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY RICHER IN SPECIES THAN FARMLAND PLOTS. SPECIES NUMBER ON FARMLAND PLOTS INCREASED LINEARLY WITH THE COVER OF FARM WOODLAND AND NON-LINEARLY WITH DENSITY OF TOTAL HEDGEROW. SPECIES NUMBER INCREASED WITH DENSITY OF NON-ROADSIDE HEDGEROWS, BUT NOT WITH DENSITY OF ROADSIDE HEDGEROWS. ALTHOUGH THE FARMLAND AND WOODLAND PLOTS SUPPORTED DISTINCTIVE BIRD COMMUNITIES, THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE OVERLAP BETWEEN THEM IN SPECIES COMPOSITION. THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE SPECIES COMPOSITION ON INDIVIDUAL FARMS AND THAT THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE FOR WOODLAND INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE COVER OF FARM WOODLAND, HEDGEROW DENSITY AND THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF WOODY HABITAT PRESENT WITHIN THE FARMLAND PLOT. CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS AND PREFERENCE INDICES INDICATED THAT SEVEN SPECIES COULD BE REGARDED AS HEDGEROW SPECIALISTS: DUNNOCK PRUNELLA MODULARIS, WHITETHROAT SYLVIA COMMUNIS, LESSER WHITETHROAT S. CURRUCA, LINNET CARDUELIS CANNABINA, GOLDFINCH C. CARDUELIS, GREENFINCH C. CHLORIS AND YELLOWHAMMER EMBERIZA CITRINELLA.

THE HABITAT NEEDS OF THE HEDGEROW SPECIALISTS SHOW CONSIDERABLE VARIATION AND DO NOT ALWAYS COINCIDE WITH THE HEDGEROW STRUCTURES THAT SUPPORT THE GREATEST NUMBERS OF BIRD SPECIES AND HIGHEST DENSITIES OF BIRDS. MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES THAT MAINTAIN A DIVERSITY OF HEDGEROW STRUCTURES ARE, THEREFORE, DESIRABLE.

KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE HYDROLOGICAL ROLE OF HEDGEROWS IS USEFUL IN MANY FIELDS OF STUDY, SUCH AS HYDROLOGICAL MODELLING AND RURAL LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF A HEDGEROW ON RAINFALL DISTRIBUTION, SOIL-WATER POTENTIAL GRADIENT, LATERAL WATER TRANSFER AND WATER BALANCE. A HILLSLOPE WITH A HEDGEROW PERPENDICULAR TO THE SLOPE WAS MONITORED. TO EVALUATE HEDGEROW RAINFALL INTERCEPTION, RAINFALL WAS MEASURED (HOURLY, DAILY, AND BY RAINFALL EVENT) BOTH NEXT TO AND UP TO 16 M UPSLOPE AND 12 M DOWNSLOPE PERPENDICULARLY AWAY FROM THE HEDGEROW. THE STRONGEST CORRELATION BETWEEN RAINFALL NEXT TO THE HEDGEROW AND RAINFALL AT MORE DISTANT POINTS WAS OBTAINED USING DATA MEASURED PER RAINFALL EVENT. THE AVERAGE PERCENTAGE OF RAINFALL INTERCEPTED EQUALLED 28% FOR THE LEAFED PERIOD AND 12% FOR THE LEAFLESS PERIOD. THE IMPACT OF THE HEDGEROW ON SPATIAL RAINFALL DISTRIBUTION WAS RELATED TO DISTANCE FROM THE HEDGEROW AND RAINFALL AMOUNT. ANNUAL DISTRIBUTION OF SOIL-WATER POTENTIAL SHOWED THAT THE HEDGEROW INFLUENCED IT UP TO 9 M UPSLOPE AND 6 M DOWNSLOPE, THE AREA IN WHICH MOST OF THE HEDGEROW'S ROOTS WERE OBSERVED. THE SOIL WAS DRIEST AT THE END OF SUMMER, WHICH DELAYED SOIL REWETTING DURING AUTUMN IN AREAS SURROUNDING THE HEDGEROW. ANNUAL GROUNDWATER DYNAMICS EXHIBITED THREE DISTINCT PERIODS DUE TO TEMPORAL RAINFALL DISTRIBUTION AND, ESPECIALLY AT THE END OF SUMMER, ROOT-WATER UPTAKE. IN ADDITION, THE TOTAL POTENTIAL GRADIENT SHOWED THAT UNSATURATED FLOW WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE HEDGEROW IN SUMMER AND AUTUMN. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT AT THE LOCAL SCALE HEDGEROWS INFLUENCES (1) SPATIAL RAINFALL DISTRIBUTION, (2) SOIL REWETTING, AND (3) GROUNDWATER RECHARGE, OFTEN AT DISTANCES WELL BEYOND THE HEDGEROW'S DRIP LINE. CONSEQUENTLY, THE PROCESSES INVOLVED IN SOIL-WATER DYNAMICS AROUND HEDGEROWS SHOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO RELEVANT HYDROLOGICAL MODELS, ESPECIALLY FOR CATCHMENTS WITH A DENSE HEDGEROW NETWORK.","22","24","4723","4735","HYDROLOGICAL MODELLING; SOIL WATER; GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; WATER POTENTIAL; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; WATER TABLE; INTERCEPTION; WATER BALANCE; HYDROLOGY (AGRICULTURE)","","","","","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.7081 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008HyPr...22.4723G/abstract https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/427849 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01460891","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1002/HYP.7081","","10.1002/hyp.7081","2093924171","","0","000-030-009-645-380; 003-049-089-342-759; 003-391-661-011-410; 007-149-642-585-638; 010-578-199-579-316; 015-988-302-344-181; 016-651-806-548-439; 023-530-930-101-311; 025-296-906-047-191; 027-183-769-733-081; 027-508-322-472-615; 027-948-167-594-24X; 031-371-779-422-482; 031-616-203-019-263; 032-124-344-064-944; 035-621-094-786-173; 036-466-585-417-013; 038-249-246-575-713; 039-187-623-690-051; 039-717-634-771-012; 042-109-862-383-299; 044-936-183-176-484; 046-858-036-681-925; 047-175-308-437-162; 051-948-668-815-530; 057-015-286-235-390; 059-059-326-871-971; 062-590-691-329-894; 065-287-761-831-861; 083-149-726-254-365; 085-526-051-539-277; 094-474-879-444-037; 101-504-801-125-323; 104-404-527-699-287; 106-577-195-165-411; 115-354-687-170-450; 119-707-807-050-266; 121-342-906-721-400; 123-823-859-397-010; 124-228-518-685-882; 125-564-609-352-214; 126-507-210-991-407; 126-973-969-969-908; 130-109-751-983-048; 131-484-409-108-898; 140-466-876-403-682; 154-383-209-000-147; 156-624-196-949-616; 160-494-015-421-129; 161-182-820-450-575; 163-554-538-545-279; 167-898-313-243-880; 168-193-278-954-64X; 169-707-009-361-549; 181-306-809-476-587; 181-521-803-511-646; 182-900-736-824-779; 183-478-831-627-672; 185-528-250-340-53X; 189-080-398-097-428; 197-410-197-111-616; 198-774-640-872-545; 199-216-234-147-970","37","GHOLAMREZA GHAZAVI; ZAHRA THOMAS; Y.

HOWEVER, THE EFFECT OF VBS DESIGNS AND SPECIES COMPOSITION ON REDUCING HERBICIDE AND VETERINARY ANTIBIOTIC TRANSPORT HAS NOT BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED. AN EXPERIMENT CONSISTING OF THREE VBS DESIGNS AND ONE CONTINUOUS CULTIVATED FALLOW CONTROL REPLICATED IN TRIPLICATE WAS CONDUCTED TO ASSESS EFFECTIVENESS IN REDUCING HERBICIDE AND ANTIBIOTIC TRANSPORT FOR CLAYPAN SOILS. THE THREE VBS DESIGNS INCLUDE (I) TALL FESCUE, (II) TALL FESCUE WITH A SWITCHGRASS HEDGE BARRIER, AND (III) NATIVE VEGETATION (LARGELY EASTERN GAMAGRASS). RAINFALL SIMULATION WAS USED TO CREATE UNIFORM ANTECEDENT SOIL MOISTURE CONTENT IN THE PLOTS AND TO GENERATE RUNOFF. OUR RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT ALL VBS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE TRANSPORT OF DISSOLVED AND SEDIMENT-BOUND ATRAZINE, METOLACHLOR, AND GLYPHOSATE IN SURFACE RUNOFF BY 58 TO 72%. FOUR TO 8 M OF ANY TESTED VBS REDUCED DISSOLVED SULFAMETHAZINE TRANSPORT IN THE SURFACE RUNOFF BY MORE THAN 70%.

WE INVESTIGATED THE DENITRIFIER ENZYME ACTIVITY (DEA) TO TEST HOW THE BUFFER STRIP MANAGEMENT MODIFIES THE DENITRIFICATION PROCESS. THE EXPERIMENTAL SITE IS COMPOSED OF A CROP FIELD AND A 11 M WIDE GRASSED BUFFER STRIP AT THE BORDER BETWEEN THE CROP FIELD AND A TRIBUTARY TO THE ATTERT RIVER, SOUTH-EAST BELGIUM. SOIL SAMPLES FROM THE CROP FIELD AND THE BUFFER STRIP HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO DIFFERENT IMPOSED CONDITIONS COMBINING GLUCOSE, NITRATE AND WATER SATURATION TO INVESTIGATE HOW ANTECEDENT WATER REGIME, NITRATE AND CARBON CONTENT AFFECT DENITRIFICATION. THE WORK INCLUDED DEA MEASUREMENTS ON UNDISTURBED SOIL CORES FRESHLY SAMPLED. EXPERIMENTS ON UNDISTURBED SOIL CORES IDENTIFY THE BUFFER STRIP AS MORE EFFECTIVE IN DENITRIFICATION (P < 0.001) THAN THE CROPPED FIELD.

ONE SUCH SUITE OF CRITICAL WATER QUALITY PARAMETERS INCLUDES WATER CLARITY, TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLIDS (TSS), AND TOTAL DISSOLVED SOLIDS (TDS). TO ADDRESS THIS, BEASLEY LAKE, A 25 HA (62 AC) OXBOW LAKE LOCATED IN A 915 HA (2,261 AC) WATERSHED OF INTENSIVE ROW CROP AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY, WAS STUDIED. THE LAKE WAS SEDIMENT IMPAIRED WHEN MONITORING WAS INITIATED IN 1995 AND WAS A CANDIDATE TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WATERSHED-WIDE BMPS ON LAKE WATER CLARITY (AS SECCHI DEPTH), TSS CONCENTRATIONS, AND TDS. A VARIETY OF BMPS WITHIN ROW CROP FIELDS, AT FIELD EDGES THROUGHOUT THE WATERSHED, AND ENROLLMENT OF 112 HA (277 AC) INTO THE CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM (CRP) BETWEEN 1997 TO 2006 FOCUSED ON REDUCING SOIL EROSION AND CONCOMITANT SEDIMENT RUNOFF. SELECTED PARAMETERS WERE MEASURED APPROXIMATELY BIWEEKLY FROM 1996 TO 2009. DURING THIS 14-YEAR PERIOD, CHANGES IN ROW CROP MANAGEMENT AND BMP IMPLEMENTATIONS AND ALTERATIONS WERE OBSERVED AND RECORDED IN CON- JUNCTION WITH TARGETED WATER QUALITY PARAMETERS.

WITH A TOTAL OF 90 ARTHROPOD SPECIES IN THE SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS, FIVE TIMES MORE SPECIES WERE FOUND THAN IN THE ARABLE FIELDS. STAPHYLINIDS, CARABIDS, SPIDERS AND CHILOPODS WERE THE MOST ABUNDANT ARTHROPOD GROUPS. THE DATA SHOWED THAT UNDISTURBED SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS AND EXTENSIVELY MANAGED FIELD MARGINS PLAY A KEY ROLE AS OVERWINTERING SITES FOR MANY PREDATORY ARTHROPODS.","78","3","215","222","ORGANIC FARMING; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; OVERWINTERING; ARTHROPOD; WILDFLOWER; SPECIES DIVERSITY; AGRONOMY; ARABLE LAND; ABUNDANCE (ECOLOGY); BIOLOGY","","","","","http://directory.umm.ac.id/Data%20Elmu/jurnal/A/Agriculture,%20Ecosystems%20and%20Environment/Vol78.Issue3.May2000/1529.pdf https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20001110984 https://orgprints.org/id/eprint/37083/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880999001309","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/S0167-8809(99)00130-9","","10.1016/s0167-8809(99)00130-9","2119592305","","0","010-888-549-334-33X; 013-270-209-241-22X; 015-578-334-267-852; 022-070-333-305-083; 022-526-631-372-455; 025-455-412-229-513; 027-873-912-072-078; 038-100-698-630-781; 051-103-549-479-234; 056-892-041-411-85X; 063-969-916-506-365; 074-904-039-536-547; 077-294-162-803-894; 084-384-881-244-614; 084-942-306-543-822; 087-186-786-234-321; 089-569-101-533-021; 112-148-110-351-322; 120-425-598-977-443; 132-569-724-005-273; 141-759-936-693-745; 192-630-203-699-413; 197-738-457-096-125","241","LUKAS PFIFFNER; HENRYK LUKA","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","","LENS",0,"PFIFFNER L, 2000, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","PFIFFNER L, 2000, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT"

HEDGEROWS PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT HABITAT FOR WILDLIFE INCLUDING INVERTEBRATES, REPRESENTING A LARGE PROPORTION OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT PATCHES IN THE MODERN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES OF THE UK AND EUROPE. AROUND 40% OF HEDGEROW LENGTH IN ENGLAND IS MANAGED UNDER AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEME (AES) OPTIONS, WHICH SPECIFY LESS FREQUENT CUTTING AND ADVISE CUTTING IN WINTER.; 2. HEDGEROW MANAGEMENT CAN ALTER HABITAT STRUCTURE AND QUALITY, POTENTIALLY INFLUENCING INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE. WE ASSESSED THE IMPACTS OF MANAGEMENT TREATMENTS ON MOTH COMMUNITIES AND THEIR PARASITOIDS. TWO TREATMENTS (‘CUTTING FREQUENCY’: ONCE EVERY 1, 2, OR 3 YEARS, AND ‘CUTTING TIME’: AUTUMN VS. WINTER) WERE APPLIED TO A LONG-RUNNING HEDGEROW EXPERIMENT, MIMICKING AES PRESCRIPTIONS. MOTH LARVAE WERE COLLECTED FROM THE HEDGEROWS, IDENTIFIED AND REARED TO DETERMINE PARASITISM. HEDGEROW STRUCTURE AND FOLIAR QUALITY WERE QUANTIFIED AND RELATED TO CHANGES IN MOTH ABUNDANCE, DIVERSITY, SPECIES RICHNESS, AND PARASITISM.; 3. HEDGEROW MANAGEMENT DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OVERALL ABUNDANCE OF MOTH LARVAE, BUT DID AFFECT THE ABUNDANCE OF CERTAIN FEEDING GUILDS AND TROPHIC INTERACTIONS WITH PARASITOIDS. CONCEALED MOTH LARVAE (MINING, TENTIFORM, AND CASE BEARING) WERE MORE ABUNDANT ON HEDGEROWS CUT INFREQUENTLY (EVERY 2 OR 3 YEARS VS. ANNUALLY). PARASITISM RATES WERE HIGHER ON HEDGEROWS CUT LESS OFTEN, WHEN THESE WERE CUT IN AUTUMN. THERE WAS A STRONG TREND TOWARDS GREATER MOTH SPECIES RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY ON WINTER CUT HEDGEROWS.; 4.

RIPARIAN MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN EMBRACED BY WATER AND LAND MANAGERS GLOBALLY TO OFFSET THE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS OF INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL LAND USE ON AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS. HOWEVER, THE DOCUMENTED RESPONSES OF STREAM COMMUNITIES TO RIPARIAN MANAGEMENT HAVE BEEN VARIABLE, PARTICULARLY IN HIGHLY DEGRADED SYSTEMS. 2. WE USED BOOSTED REGRESSION TREES AND STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF RIPARIAN CONDITION AND STREAM SIZE ON THE INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES OF 64 AGRICULTURAL WATERWAYS ON THE CANTERBURY PLAINS, NEW ZEALAND. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT SMALL STREAMS WOULD BE MORE DEGRADED THAN LARGER WATERWAYS BUT WOULD SHOW A GREATER INCREASE IN THE ABUNDANCE OF POLLUTION-SENSITIVE AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES IN RESPONSE TO RIPARIAN MANAGEMENT. WE ALSO PREDICTED THAT LAND-USE LEGACIES OF POOR IN-STREAM HABITAT WOULD REDUCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CURRENT RIPARIAN MANAGEMENT. THE TWO STRONGEST DETERMINANTS OF COMMUNITY STRUCTURE WERE PRIMARILY IN-STREAM HABITAT, WHERE SEDIMENTATION AND LOW WATER VELOCITY HAD NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON STREAM COMMUNITIES, AND STREAM SIZE, WITH SMALLER WATERWAYS GENERALLY MORE IMPACTED THAN LARGE WATERWAYS. NOT SURPRISINGLY, WITH >150 YEARS OF AGRICULTURE AND PATCHY RIPARIAN MANAGEMENT ON THE PLAINS, CURRENT MANAGEMENT HAS NOT GREATLY IMPROVED IN-STREAM HABITAT AND THUS HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON THE ABUNDANCE OF SENSITIVE AQUATIC INSECT (EPT) TAXA. 3. MANAGED STREAMS DID, HOWEVER, HAVE MORE POLLUTION-SENSITIVE COMMUNITIES IN GENERAL. THIS WAS LARGELY MEDIATED BY DECREASED STREAM TEMPERATURE, NARROWER ⁄ DEEPER CHANNELS AND GREATER ORGANIC MATTER RESOURCES IN STREAMS WITH RIPARIAN PLANTING AND RESTRICTED STOCK ACCESS. THUS, IF WATER VELOCITY AND SEDIMENTATION ISSUES CAN BE MITIGATED, THEN RIPARIAN MANAGEMENT SHOULD BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE. 4. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A DEGRADED AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE, WE IDENTIFIED FACTORS LIMITING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RIPARIAN MANAGEMENT FOR STREAM INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES. RIPARIAN MANAGEMENT SHOULD PRIMARILY TARGET AND PROTECT SMALL STREAMS AND THOSE WITHOUT DEGRADED IN-STREAM HABITAT. INTENSIVE MANAGEMENT, SUCH AS IN-STREAM HABITAT OR CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY MODIFICATION, MAY BE NEEDED TO ADDRESS HISTORICAL FACTORS (E.G. LOW VELOCITY AND SEDIMENTATION), WHICH OTHERWISE MAY CONTINUE TO LIMIT COMMUNITY RECOVERY.","49","1","213","222","LAND DEGRADATION; RIPARIAN ZONE; AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; LAND USE; AGRICULTURAL LAND; RESTORATION ECOLOGY; LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","","","","","https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02092.x%4010.1111/%28ISSN%291365-2656.FRESHWATER http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02092.x/abstract https://scholarsmine.mst.edu/biosci_facwork/223/ https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02092.x https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02092.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02092.x%4010.1111/%28ISSN%291365-2435.FRESHWATER https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02092.x","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1365-2664.2011.02092.X","","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02092.x","2112225879","","0","000-302-332-875-297; 001-119-833-238-908; 001-699-479-136-901; 002-239-487-029-857; 004-197-813-891-486; 006-743-390-664-481; 008-276-010-849-381; 010-670-305-123-42X; 013-367-327-282-701; 015-031-207-682-544; 015-256-006-013-114; 018-200-676-614-484; 021-207-457-184-365; 022-479-744-247-184; 022-989-733-515-50X; 024-125-558-121-048; 026-988-011-549-709; 030-718-641-328-198; 033-766-715-903-569; 034-124-984-251-636; 037-060-401-034-007; 041-814-374-999-489; 046-368-918-746-231; 047-825-554-899-487; 052-306-657-152-534; 052-583-140-294-949; 067-367-059-017-184; 069-248-024-101-416; 070-001-765-983-621; 086-685-350-382-999; 095-483-804-128-84X; 096-196-209-039-855; 096-992-699-821-977; 110-273-471-720-293; 121-178-085-490-606; 125-859-662-791-556; 126-051-201-417-566; 128-107-067-690-029; 147-317-912-994-359; 149-520-541-575-986; 154-204-104-510-021; 189-738-474-429-219","52","MICHELLE J.

FOR ALL LAND USES MOST OF THE ROOT BIOMASS WAS WITHIN THE 0–20 CM DEPTH RANGE. TOTAL COARSE ROOT BIOMASS, TO A 60 CM DEPTH, RANGED FROM 8.8-73.7 T/HA IN WOODLOTS, 0.6-1.3 T/HA IN HERBACEOUS BUFFERS, AND 9.2-27.3 T/HA IN POPLARS.

TOTAL ROOT BIOMASS WAS SIMILAR OR HIGHER IN POPLAR BUFFERS COMPARED TO A 27 YEAR-OLD GREY BIRCH FOREST. THIS INDICATES THAT POPLAR BUFFERS ACCELERATED RIPARIAN SOIL COLONISATION BY ROOTS COMPARED TO NATURAL SECONDARY SUCCESSION.

HOWEVER, THESE SCHEMES REQUIRE EVALUATION TO ESTIMATE THEIR EFFICIENCY, FOR FURTHER CONSOLIDATION AND IMPROVEMENT. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GRASSY STRIPS ALONG WATERCOURSES REPRESENTS A MEASURE OF CROSS-COMPLIANCE INTRODUCED IN FRANCE IN 2005. IN THIS STUDY, WE ANALYZED THE BENEFITS OF THESE NEW LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS FOR BIODIVERSITY, BY (I) EXPLORING THE PLANT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OF GRASSY STRIPS IN RELATION TO THEIR LANDSCAPE CONTEXT, (II) ANALYZING THE FAUNAL COMMUNITIES OF THREE MAJOR FUNCTIONAL GROUPS (I.E., SMALL MAMMALS, SYRPHIDS, AND CARABID BEETLES) PRESENT IN GRASSY STRIPS OF AGROECOSYSTEMS, (III) COMPARING THE FAUNAL BIODIVERSITY TO THAT OBSERVED IN OTHER HABITATS OF AGROECOSYSTEMS, SUCH AS FIELDS AND HEDGEROWS, AND (IV) INVESTIGATING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FAUNAL COMMUNITY INDICES AND GRASSY STRIP PROPERTIES. THE RESULTS OF OUR STUDY SHOWED THAT THE PLANT COMMUNITY OF GRASSY STRIPS IS MAINLY INFLUENCED BY SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS THAT ARE PRESENT WITHIN A LANDSCAPE CONTEXT, I.E., AT A SCALE >500 M. WE FOUND THAT GRASSY STRIPS DO NOT NECESSARILY PRESENT AREAS OF PARTICULARLY HIGH ANIMAL BIODIVERSITY COMPARED TO OTHER HABITATS (I.E., FIELDS AND HEDGEROWS). HOWEVER, THE PROPERTIES OF THESE STRIPS (I.E., LENGTH, WIDTH AND PLANT BIODIVERSITY) INFLUENCE THE STRUCTURE OF FAUNAL COMMUNITIES. TWO YEARS AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GRASSY STRIPS, THEIR ROLE AS ECOTONES BETWEEN PREVIOUS FIELD MARGINS (MOSTLY HEDGEROWS IN OUR STUDY SITE) IS ILLUSTRATED THROUGH THE RESPONSE OF THE FAUNA. HENCE, GRASSY STRIPS, BEING MORE STABLE THAN CULTIVATED FIELDS, CONTRIBUTE TO A NEW REFUGE WITHIN THE AGROECOSYSTEM LANDSCAPE.","166","","15","27","FAUNA; BIODIVERSITY; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; ECOTONE; GEOGRAPHY; BENEFICIAL INSECTS; EUROPEAN UNION; PLANT COMMUNITY; AGROFORESTRY; AGROECOSYSTEM","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880912002642 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880912002642","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.AGEE.2012.07.004","","10.1016/j.agee.2012.07.004","2089712263","","0","000-240-239-990-548; 000-706-796-635-17X; 004-022-348-071-073; 006-308-525-460-894; 007-871-326-224-951; 008-225-619-668-580; 008-777-165-646-699; 011-162-095-263-090; 011-672-108-275-761; 011-789-039-750-846; 012-247-538-497-064; 012-357-805-545-268; 013-096-083-292-716; 020-610-220-757-448; 021-456-573-673-200; 023-251-810-309-271; 023-360-149-157-668; 024-744-163-026-022; 027-540-280-426-898; 030-388-440-825-295; 030-453-266-652-445; 031-114-644-626-51X; 034-366-554-328-48X; 036-511-884-406-410; 037-002-778-558-737; 038-618-402-954-434; 039-931-152-932-802; 040-863-991-027-524; 041-469-176-773-812; 042-749-789-102-563; 044-531-648-558-840; 045-806-064-594-473; 046-500-604-745-231; 049-847-857-286-223; 050-224-806-567-10X; 050-229-016-868-066; 051-197-969-663-775; 054-715-078-148-813; 055-054-076-410-76X; 055-083-398-263-398; 056-979-258-730-423; 057-332-914-601-179; 058-011-278-535-092; 061-967-232-577-128; 063-426-464-521-853; 065-985-181-262-074; 070-194-102-378-889; 072-090-852-140-219; 072-170-722-254-058; 073-359-404-037-66X; 074-068-982-114-504; 074-793-529-288-006; 075-336-397-615-388; 075-409-586-145-383; 077-396-195-490-895; 078-960-284-587-139; 080-348-794-816-190; 080-506-366-738-457; 092-228-898-297-400; 095-877-317-702-391; 099-188-994-062-936; 111-085-619-662-631; 111-628-243-264-528; 113-225-847-396-026; 114-646-769-502-277; 119-352-383-206-342; 125-357-678-676-499; 126-903-252-358-903; 127-747-168-852-33X; 130-202-097-914-836; 135-630-136-231-708; 135-883-559-011-411; 141-273-200-926-50X; 144-700-882-404-647; 145-176-906-866-327; 148-789-623-443-683; 150-325-162-873-23X; 153-953-890-806-330; 155-691-175-864-748; 159-118-144-919-455; 169-066-269-448-571; 169-297-520-424-667; 184-257-981-904-628; 186-366-535-751-970; 186-739-979-596-835; 187-603-367-498-373; 188-468-956-254-948; 196-882-208-161-504","25","AUDE ERNOULT; AUDE VIALATTE; ALAIN BUTET; NADIA MICHEL; YANN RANTIER; OLIVIER JAMBON; FRANÇOISE BUREL","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","","LENS",0,"ERNOULT A, 2013, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","ERNOULT A, 2013, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT"

THE MAIN REASON FOR THE LACK OF SUCCESS OF AES IS CONSIDERED TO BE THEIR LOW ECOLOGICAL QUALITY AND INSUFFICIENT AREA. UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ON THE ECOLOGICAL QUALITY OF AES IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT. HERE, WE INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BREEDING BIRD DENSITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS AND THE AGE OF SOWN FIELD MARGINS, A WIDELY USED TYPE OF AES, IN SOUTHWESTERN SWITZERLAND. TERRITORIES OF BREEDING BIRDS WERE MAPPED ON 67 FIELD MARGINS BETWEEN 2004 AND 2011. TERRITORY DENSITIES (FOR EIGHT SPECIES) AND SPECIES RICHNESS WERE ANALYSED IN RELATION TO AGE OF THE FIELD MARGIN. A GENERAL NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN SIZE OF THE FIELD MARGIN AND TERRITORY DENSITY INDICATED THAT TERRITORY DENSITY WAS HIGHER WHEN THE BIRDS COULD FORAGE IN ADJACENT CULTIVATED LAND. TERRITORY DENSITIES AND SPECIES RICHNESS INCREASED UP TO AN AGE OF 4–6 YEARS AFTER SOWING, DEPENDING ON THE SPECIES, AND DECLINED THEREAFTER. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE CO-OCCURRENCE OF NEWLY SOWN MARGINS AND MARGINS OVER 3 YEARS OLD WILL HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON BREEDING BIRD DENSITIES AND SPECIES DIVERSITY.","155","4","779","791","FORAGE (HONEY BEE); FIELD (GEOGRAPHY); SOWING; ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; SET-ASIDE; NEGATIVE CORRELATION; CULTIVATED LAND; SPECIES RICHNESS; SPECIES DIVERSITY","","","","","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ibi.12072/full https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ibi.12072","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/IBI.12072","","10.1111/ibi.12072","2035200474","","0","001-760-813-322-022; 002-845-097-888-509; 004-010-787-386-28X; 004-359-808-503-708; 005-170-676-904-856; 006-545-720-817-552; 007-416-181-403-689; 014-630-972-063-626; 015-532-756-399-78X; 015-691-707-399-917; 016-421-756-148-512; 017-786-901-727-296; 018-028-975-115-624; 018-352-146-661-534; 020-167-621-399-502; 020-652-008-679-636; 022-667-644-785-266; 023-103-648-255-011; 025-173-978-983-077; 026-527-744-858-38X; 031-188-996-161-21X; 031-206-874-111-261; 031-592-787-048-258; 037-002-778-558-737; 044-307-871-990-779; 045-088-035-767-327; 049-771-162-087-705; 059-649-458-440-049; 064-454-510-982-621; 068-452-604-669-157; 070-314-903-562-073; 070-582-747-582-275; 073-356-085-087-083; 075-813-896-905-215; 077-277-772-557-227; 085-668-122-415-751; 086-098-672-045-008; 093-835-124-539-323; 095-014-169-963-827; 097-362-331-074-408; 102-954-311-394-795; 107-532-685-702-969; 108-606-742-009-569; 109-759-036-269-420; 131-060-331-668-772; 145-728-200-767-581; 150-356-700-290-587; 161-300-804-429-199; 167-175-414-731-307; 169-754-255-995-936; 170-860-112-949-62X; 178-411-469-458-660; 194-734-770-739-898; 197-392-866-862-614","14","JEAN-LUC ZOLLINGER; SIMON BIRRER; NIKLAUS ZBINDEN; FRÄNZI KORNER-NIEVERGELT","IBIS","IBIS","","LENS",0,"ZOLLINGER JL, 2013, IBIS","ZOLLINGER JL, 2013, IBIS"

A COMMON BELIEF EXISTS THAT THIS CHANGE HAS ADDED AESTHETIC VALUE TO THE LANDSCAPE; HOWEVER, THIS HAS NOT BEEN SCIENTIFICALLY DOCUMENTED. THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE SCENIC BEAUTY OF SHELTERBELTS. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY WERE TO: (1) DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG SHELTERBELTS, OTHER LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS, AND SCENIC BEAUTY, (2) DETERMINE DIFFERENCES IN SCENIC BEAUTY JUDGMENTS BASED ON BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBSERVERS, AND (3) DETERMINE IF SCENIC BEAUTY JUDGMENTS REMAINED THE SAME OVER TWO SEPARATE VIEWINGS OF THE SAME SCENES BY THE SAME OBSERVERS. ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY STUDENTS VIEWED 60 SLIDES OF PLAINS LANDSCAPES WITH AND WITHOUT SHELTERBELTS. TWENTY-FOUR VIEWERS SAW THE SLIDES TWICE. VIEWERS WERE ASKED TO RATE THE SLIDES FOR SCENIC BEAUTY ON A SCALE OF 0 (LOW) TO 9 (HIGH). THEY ALSO ANSWERED DEMOGRAPHIC AND BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTIC QUESTIONS. THE SCENIC BEAUTY SCORES WERE SCALED TO FORM SCENIC BEAUTY ESTIMATES. SIMPLE CORRELATION AND MULTIPLE REGRESSION WERE USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA.

WE STUDIED THE 15-YR CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF NARROW AND PERENNIAL SWITCHGRASS (PANICUM VIRGATUM L.) BARRIERS ON SOIL ORGANIC C (SOC), TOTAL N, PARTICULATE ORGANIC MATTER (POM), AND ASSOCIATED SOIL STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES AS COMPARED WITH THE CROPPED AREA ON AN AKSARBEN SILTY CLAY LOAM (FINE, SMECTITIC, MESIC TYPIC ARGIUDOLL) WITH 5.4% SLOPE IN EASTERN NEBRASKA. FIVE SWITCHGRASS BARRIERS WERE ESTABLISHED IN 1998 AT ∼38-M INTERVALS PARALLEL TO THE CROP ROWS IN A FIELD UNDER A CONVENTIONAL TILLAGE AND NO-TILL GRAIN SORGHUM [SORGHUM BICOLOR (L.) MOENCH]–SOYBEAN [GLYCINE MAX (L.) MERR.]–CORN (ZEA MAYS L.) ROTATION. COMPARED WITH THE CROPPED AREA, SWITCHGRASS BARRIERS ACCUMULATED ABOUT 0.85 MG HA⁻¹ YR⁻¹ OF SOC AND 80 KG HA⁻¹ YR⁻¹ OF TOTAL SOIL N AT THE 0 TO 15 CM SOIL DEPTH. SWITCHGRASS BARRIERS ALSO INCREASED COARSE POM BY 60%. MEAN WEIGHT DIAMETER OF WATER-STABLE AGGREGATES INCREASED BY 70% AT 0 TO 15 CM AND BY 40% AT 15 TO 60 CM, INDICATING THAT SWITCHGRASS BARRIERS IMPROVED SOIL AGGREGATION AT DEEPER DEPTHS. LARGE (4.75–8 MM) MACROAGGREGATES UNDER SWITCHGRASS BARRIERS CONTAINED 30% MORE SOC THAN THOSE UNDER THE CROPPED AREA. SWITCHGRASS-INDUCED CHANGES IN SOC CONCENTRATION WERE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH AGGREGATE STABILITY (R = 0.89***) AND POROSITY (R = 0.47*).

HOWEVER, HEDGEROWS AND OTHER STRUCTURES CAN ALSO IMPEDE DISPERSAL BY FLYING INSECTS. THE CURRENT WORK USES THE POLLEN OF PHACELIA TANACETIFOLIA IN HOVER FLY GUTS AS A MARKER TO ASSESS HOVER FLY MOVEMENT IN FARM LANDSCAPES. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND NEW ZEALAND, PHACELIA POLLEN WAS FOUND IN THE GUTS OF EPHISYRPHUS BALTEATUS AND METASYRPHUS COROLLAE (UNITED KINGDOM) AND MELANOSTOMA FASCIATUM (NEW ZEALAND) AT DISTANCES UP TO 200 M FROM THE SOURCE, WHEN THERE WERE NO BARRIERS BETWEEN THE FLOWERS AND THE TRAPS USED TO CATCH THE FLIES. THE RATE OF DECLINE OVER DISTANCE IN THE PROPORTION OF FLIES CONTAINING POLLEN WAS SIMILAR FOR THE TWO COUNTRIES. THE EXTENT TO WHICH FOUR REPLICATED FIELD BOUNDARY TYPES IMPEDED HOVER FLY MOVEMENT WAS TESTED USING POST-AND-WIRE FENCES, LINES OF POPLARS (POPULUS SPP.) WITH GAPS, DENSE POPLARS AND CONTROLS (NO POTENTIAL BARRIERS). PHACELIA WAS PLANTED ON ONE SIDE OF EACH BOUNDARY, AND ALONG THE CENTRE OF THE CONTROL PLOTS. THE RELATIVE PRESENCE OF THE POLLEN IN FLIES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BARRIERS SHOWED THAT BOTH TYPES OF POPLAR BOUNDARY RESTRICTED THE MOVEMENT OF THE FLIES, BUT THE FENCE HAD NO EFFECT. IN A SEPARATE EXPERIMENT, GRAVID FEMALES OF M. FASCIATUM WERE CAPTURED AT A GREATER HEIGHT ON A SHADE-CLOTH FENCE THAN WERE NON-GRAVID FEMALES AND MALES. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WORK INCLUDE THE FUNCTIONING AND PERSISTENCE OF METAPOPULATIONS AND THE INFLUENCE OF FIELD BOUNDARIES ON POPULATION RECOVERY OF BENEFICIAL INVERTEBRATES FOLLOWING PESTICIDE-INDUCED MORTALITY. IF FIELD BOUNDARIES CONTRIBUTE TO A TEMPORAL ASYNCHRONY BETWEEN PEST AND NATURAL ENEMY POPULATIONS, THIS NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED ALONG WITH THE WELL-ESTABLISHED ROLES OF BOUNDARIES AS REFUGIA FOR, AND SOURCES OF, BENEFICIAL ARTHROPODS.","134","4","605","611","HABITAT; ECOLOGY; METAPOPULATION; PHACELIA TANACETIFOLIA; PHACELIA; MELANOSTOMA FASCIATUM; POLLEN; POPULATION; BIOLOGICAL DISPERSAL; BIOLOGY","","AGRICULTURE; ANIMALS; DIPTERA; FEMALE; FLIGHT, ANIMAL; FLOWERS; MAGNOLIOPSIDA; MALE; MOVEMENT; POLLEN; POPULATION DYNAMICS; PREGNANCY; REPRODUCTION","","","https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003Oecol.134..605W/abstract https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00442-002-1128-9 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12647134/ https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20033043034 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12647134 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-002-1128-9/fulltext.html","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1007/S00442-002-1128-9","12647134","10.1007/s00442-002-1128-9","2082940274","","0","000-999-762-967-231; 001-837-644-580-145; 006-314-244-124-537; 006-520-018-288-928; 008-608-775-518-291; 008-821-738-651-977; 009-646-332-019-745; 010-888-549-334-33X; 013-394-770-638-112; 013-539-528-365-106; 016-469-617-882-795; 019-658-253-028-863; 020-387-952-708-095; 023-835-862-117-81X; 026-735-761-517-671; 034-739-142-297-866; 037-801-316-449-334; 043-329-639-022-790; 044-341-011-136-23X; 047-130-476-878-70X; 056-892-630-404-500; 057-085-379-637-480; 057-597-475-456-662; 064-113-911-892-525; 066-807-757-722-083; 068-258-337-754-12X; 069-037-640-447-867; 071-263-947-951-344; 075-427-727-587-804; 076-540-943-950-859; 077-628-705-282-51X; 083-215-275-291-118; 086-402-015-642-906; 090-321-355-554-734; 090-682-458-827-532; 095-522-959-685-498; 099-929-944-949-999; 114-314-936-177-491; 132-980-742-169-431; 139-200-896-129-808; 140-931-811-862-053; 144-828-533-015-080; 188-441-039-602-933","146","STEVE D.

WE COMPARED NORTHERN BOBWHITE COVEY DENSITIES ON 1,088 PAIRED ROW-CROP FIELDS WITH AND WITHOUT NATIVE HERBACEOUS BUFFERS IN 13 STATES DURING AUTUMN, 2006-2008. WE USED A 2-STAGE RANDOM EFFECTS MODELING APPROACH THAT INCORPORATES THE EFFECTIVE AREA AS AN OFFSET IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS TO ASSESS REGIONAL RELATIONSHIPS AMONG AUTUMN BOBWHITE COVEY DENSITIES AND COVARIATES OF FIELD TYPE (I.E., FIELDS WITH VS. WITHOUT NATIVE HERBACEOUS BUFFERS), ECOLOGICAL REGION, YEAR, SURVEY WEEK, AND CONTRACTED VEGETATIVE COVER (I.E., PLANTING NATIVE GRASSES AND FORBS VS. ESTABLISHING THROUGH NATURAL REGENERATION). COVEY DENSITY WAS CORRELATED WITH YEAR AND INTERACTION EFFECTS OF FIELD TYPE AND ECOLOGICAL REGION. THE YEAR EFFECT SUGGESTED ANNUAL VARIATION IN COVEY DENSITIES, WHEREAS THE FIELD TYPE BY ECOLOGICAL REGION INTERACTION SUGGESTED COVEY RESPONSE TO BUFFERS WAS DEPENDENT ON SPATIAL LOCATION, LIKELY REFLECTING DIFFERENCES IN BUFFER ESTABLISHMENT, SUCCESSION, AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE AMONG REGIONS. MEAN FITTED COVEY DENSITY ON FIELDS ACROSS ALL SURVEY SITES WAS 0.047 (� 0.008 BOOTSTRAP STANDARD ERROR (BSE)) AND 0.031 COVEYS/HA (� 0.003 BSE) ON ROW-CROP FIELDS WITH AND WITHOUT HERBACEOUS BUFFERS, RESPECTIVELY.

COVEY DENSITY WAS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE GREATER IN THE CENTRAL TEXAS REGION COMPARED TO OTHER REGIONS, BUT EXHIBITED A SMALL RESPONSE TO NATIVE HERBACEOUS BUFFERS, AS DID DENSITY OF COVEYS IN THE EASTERN TALLGRASS PRAIRIE AND CENTRAL HARDWOODS REGIONS. DISPROPORTIONATE RESPONSE TO BUFFERS IN THE MISSISSIPPI ALLUVIAL VALLEY AND SOUTHEASTERN COASTAL PLAIN SUGGESTS NATIVE HERBACEOUS HABITATS MIGHT BE LIMITING DURING AUTUMN IN THESE REGIONS, WHEREAS LACK OF RESPONSE IN THE EASTERN TALLGRASS PRAIRIE, CENTRAL HARDWOODS, AND CENTRAL TEXAS REGIONS SUGGESTS THAT HERBACEOUS HABITAT EITHER WAS NOT LIMITING OR BUFFERS FAILED TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE REQUIREMENTS FOR BOBWHITES DURING AUTUMN.

GRASSED WATERWAYS ARE NATURAL OR CONSTRUCTED CHANNELS THAT HAVE BEEN SHAPED TO TRANSPORT WATER AT NONEROSIVE VELOCITIES FROM AGRICULTURAL FIELDS. WHEN PROPERLY DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED, GRASSED WATERWAYS DO NOT HAVE STANDING WATER. GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND EROSION POTENTIAL DETERMINE THE GRASS SPECIES PLANTED IN THE CHANNEL, BUT GENERALLY, COOL-SEASON GRASSES ARE USED BECAUSE OF THEIR QUICK ESTABLISHMENT AND EVEN, DENSE GROWTH (USSCS 1975). WATERWAYS ALSO WERE PROMOTED FOR THEIR BENEFITS TO WILDLIFE (USSCS 1972). HIGH DENSITIES OF NESTING BIRDS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN LINEAR AGRICULTURAL HABITATS SUCH AS FENCEROWS, ROADSIDE DITCHES, AND TERRACES (E.G., DOW 1969, BASORE ET AL. 1986). THIS RESPONSE ALSO MAY OCCUR IN WATERWAYS. BECAUSE MANY FENCEROWS HAVE BEEN REMOVED (VANCE 1976), GRASSED WATERWAYS MAY BECOME MORE IMPORTANT WILDLIFE HABITAT IN AGRICULTURAL AREAS. HIGH NEST DENSITY, HOWEVER, IS NOT NECESSARILY SYNONYMOUS WITH HIGH REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT (GATES AND GYSEL 1978). DISTURBANCE FROM FARMING PRACTICES CAN DECREASE NESTING SUCCESS BELOW THE LEVEL NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN POPULATIONS (RODENHOUSE AND BEST 1983, FRAWLEY 1989). DEVELOPMENT OF MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES FOR GRASSED WATERWAYS IS IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE 1985 AND 1990 FARM BILLS. BOTH BILLS REQUIRED LANDOWNERS TO IMPLEMENT A CONSERVATION PLAN IF THEY WERE TO CONTINUE FARMING ANNUALLY TILLED CROPS ON HIGHLY ERODIBLE LAND. CONSERVATION TILLAGE, TERRACING, AND GRASSED WATERWAYS COULD BE USED TO MEET THIS REQUIREMENT (U.S. DEP. AGRIC. 1986). OUR OBJECTIVES WERE TO (1) DETERMINE THE SPECIES AND NESTING DENSITIES OF BIRDS IN GRASSED WATERWAYS, (2) DOCUMENT NESTING SUCCESS IN GRASSED WATERWAYS, AND (3) ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF WATERWAY STRUCTURE AND VEGETATION ON NEST DENSITY AND SUCCESS.","","","","","SOIL CONSERVATION; EROSION; TILLAGE; VEGETATION; NEST; HABITAT; CONSERVATION PLAN; WILDLIFE; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; AGROFORESTRY; FORESTRY","","","","","https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/3783083.pdf","HTTPS://WWW.JSTOR.ORG/STABLE/PDFPLUS/3783083.PDF","","","2517826417","","0","001-074-375-407-762; 003-969-255-277-49X; 006-160-602-569-108; 023-723-563-125-522; 025-928-926-460-066; 039-659-322-655-52X; 044-551-205-203-731; 047-000-620-546-182; 059-988-470-375-194; 073-679-047-201-179; 075-649-156-910-746; 076-773-289-720-027; 079-666-057-795-455; 085-060-541-856-759; 086-624-644-945-989; 093-843-626-385-678; 101-181-727-684-317; 107-818-341-854-639; 110-050-807-675-927; 124-876-829-420-596; 126-880-082-484-421; 131-056-779-330-399; 136-396-731-521-906; 141-820-975-724-030; 143-146-474-539-735; 149-594-572-892-345; 179-674-764-408-659","34","GEORGIA G.

THE WIDTHS OF RIPARIAN FOREST BUFFER STRIP ARE AT LEAST 50 METERS IN THESE TWO CASE STUDY SITES. THE COMPOSITION, SPATIAL VARIABILITY AND SEASONAL CHANGES OF CATIONS AND ANIONS IN SOIL SOLUTION COLLECTING FROM ORCHARD, INTERFACE AND RIPARIAN BUFFER ZONES WERE ANALYZED TO CONTROL THE WATER QUALITY IN TWO WATER RESERVOIRS. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE SOIL NUTRIENTS IN THE ORCHARD NEAR TECHI RESERVOIR, ESPECIALLY FOR THE IONS OF PHOSPHATE, K, CA, MG, AND AMMONIUM-N, CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY INTERCEPTED BY A FOREST BUFFER STRIP WITHIN 30 METERS. OWING TO NO ANY APPLICATION OF CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS IN THE ORCHARD NEAR FEITSUI RESERVOIR SINCE 1987, THE NUTRIENT CONCENTRATION OF DIFFERENT IONS IN SOIL SOLUTION IS VERY LOW. THIS LOW CONCENTRATION OF IONS IN SOIL SOLUTION RELEASED FROM ORCHARD REGION NEAR FEITSUI RESERVOIR CAN BE INTERCEPTED IN THE INTERFACE AREA BETWEEN THE ORCHARD REGION AND FOREST BUFFER STRIP. THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT THE WIDTH OF RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIP NEEDS AT LEAST 10 METERS TO INTERCEPT THE SOLUBLE NUTRIENTS UNDER THIS VERY LOW INPUT OF CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS. WE MAKE SURE THAT ENOUGH WIDTH, AT LEAST 30 METERS OF RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIPS FOR THESE TWO CASE STUDIES, CAN BE REGARDED AS A NUTRIENT SINK TO INTERCEPT THE SOIL NUTRIENTS SOLUBLE FROM ORCHARD REGION AND KEEP GOOD WATER QUALITY IN THE RESERVOIRS.","","","","","NUTRIENT; SINK (GEOGRAPHY); RIPARIAN FOREST; RIPARIAN BUFFER; ORCHARD; WATER QUALITY; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; BUFFER STRIP; INTERCEPTION","","","","","http://210.69.150.18:8080/bitstream/345210000/2855/1/publication_no134_10.pdf","HTTP://210.69.150.18:8080/BITSTREAM/345210000/2855/1/PUBLICATION_NO134_10.PDF","","","2261913268","","0","004-842-348-026-444; 013-186-225-354-847; 015-514-563-181-208; 021-187-528-186-865; 043-732-521-013-282; 045-051-399-949-632; 061-964-645-875-912; 069-743-203-039-775; 080-589-148-600-106; 083-258-693-486-102; 087-138-533-405-771; 096-940-340-038-375; 104-993-597-055-071; 107-136-033-727-592; 111-435-647-398-863; 137-894-043-621-258; 141-101-347-131-583; 150-539-908-471-485","0","ZUENG-SANG CHEN; CHANG-FU HSIEH; JEN-CHYI LIU; CHUNG-MING LIN","","","","LENS",0,"CHEN ZS, 2008, ","CHEN ZS, 2008, "

THESE SOLUTIONS ARE GENERALLY EFFICIENT AT REDUCING POLLUTED SURFACE FLOWS, MAINLY BY INFILTRATION OF THE SOIL, RAISING THE QUESTION OF THE FATE OF THE INFILTRATED POLLUTANTS. AN ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION WAS CONDUCTED ON THE EFFICIENCY OF A GRASS STRIP RECEIVING DIURON-CONTAMINATED WATER FROM AN UPHILL VINEYARD IN FRANCE. DURING TWO RUNOFF EVENTS, THE FOLLOWING MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN: SURFACE INFLOW AND OUTFLOW WITH VENTURI FLUMES, VERTICAL PERCOLATED FLOW BELOW THE ROOT LAYER (0–50 CM), AND VARIATIONS IN WATER AND SOLUTE CONTENT OF THE ROOT LAYER. ONE RUNOFF EVENT OCCURRED UNDER NATURAL RAINFALL CONDITIONS, WHILE THE OTHER RUNOFF EVENT WAS ARTIFICIALLY PROVOKED WITH WATER DOPED BY DIURON AND BROMIDE. FOR THE NATURAL RUNOFF EVENT, REPRESENTATIVE OF MEDIUM INTENSITY EVENTS, 94% OF THE DIURON WAS RETAINED IN THE ROOT LAYER, WHEREAS 2% LEFT THE GRASS STRIP BY SURFACE RUNOFF AND 4% LEFT THE GRASS STRIP IN THE WATER PERCOLATING UNDER THE ROOT ZONE. FOR THE ARTIFICIAL EVENT, REPRESENTATIVE OF INTENSE RUNOFF EVENTS, MORE THAN HALF OF THE INCOMING DIURON WAS RETAINED BY THE GRASS STRIP, WHEREAS 24% AND 18% OF IT WERE TRANSFERRED BY SURFACE RUNOFF AND PERCOLATION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE CAPACITY OF THE ROOT LAYER TO RETAIN DIURON WAS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT DESPITE A LARGE PERCOLATION FLUX. HOWEVER, FOR LARGE RUNOFF EVENTS, SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE LOSSES CAN STILL BE CONSIDERABLE, UP TO 40% OF THE PESTICIDE LOAD ENTERING THE STRIP.","22","4","580","592","INFILTRATION (HYDROLOGY); DNS ROOT ZONE; INFLOW; VINEYARD; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; BUFFER STRIP; SURFACE RUNOFF; POLLUTANT; OUTFLOW","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1002016012600435 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1002016012600435","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/S1002-0160(12)60043-5","","10.1016/s1002-0160(12)60043-5","2035807414","","0","002-650-706-842-54X; 006-677-293-260-300; 007-985-273-091-256; 009-742-460-635-737; 010-729-699-684-898; 016-084-115-518-996; 016-986-501-772-549; 021-655-763-861-159; 024-953-196-350-874; 030-388-233-138-126; 042-230-387-909-769; 043-320-672-388-224; 044-401-317-828-273; 051-352-624-252-855; 051-851-638-777-86X; 052-894-240-545-387; 054-857-994-017-150; 055-777-345-712-483; 057-703-038-933-033; 062-646-485-663-090; 064-662-281-730-944; 065-427-966-967-115; 078-834-235-066-428; 082-425-030-497-387; 083-971-752-530-892; 086-496-072-727-834; 094-049-137-663-313; 144-806-415-704-267; 151-942-861-567-530; 178-140-173-536-98X; 181-090-792-931-175; 196-445-208-354-247","12","J.

WE ASSESSED LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE-WIDE EFFECTS OF FLOWER STRIPS ON POLLINATOR ABUNDANCES, USING 18 CAREFULLY SELECTED STUDY LANDSCAPES IN SOUTHERN SWEDEN, DISTRIBUTED ALONG INDEPENDENT GRADIENTS OF LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY AND FARMING INTENSITY. WE FOUND THAT FLOWER STRIPS WERE MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN FIELD BORDERS IN GENERAL TO BUMBLEBEES, WHEREAS HOVERFLIES WERE ONLY ATTRACTED TO FLOWER STRIPS FROM NEARBY FIELD BORDERS. SOLITARY BEES DECLINED WITH INCREASING DISTANCE FROM FLOWER STRIPS, BUT ONLY IN COMPLEX LANDSCAPES. AS ONE OF THE FIRST STUDIES INVESTIGATING EFFECTS OF FLOWER STRIPS ON POLLINATORS ACROSS THE WIDER LANDSCAPE, WE FOUND INCREASED ABUNDANCE OF BUMBLEBEES, BUT NOT SOLITARY BEES, IN FIELD BORDERS OUTSIDE THE FLOWER STRIPS IN FLORISTICALLY ENHANCED LANDSCAPES AS COMPARED WITH CONTROL LANDSCAPES.

RIVERS CAN BE SUBJECTED TO A RANGE OF ANTHROPOGENIC PRESSURES AND AGRICULTURAL LAND USE IS ONE MAJOR CAUSE OF WATER POLLUTION AND HABITAT DEGRADATION IN EUROPEAN RIVERS. THE WATER FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE IS A MAJOR LEGISLATIVE DRIVER FOR GOOD ECOLOGICAL STATUS IN EUROPE'S RIVERS AND IN THE UK; THIS HAS LED TO ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURE ON RIVERS THROUGH AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES (AES). AES ARE FUNDED FROM TAX REVENUE AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY ARE OPTIMIZED TO DELIVER MEASURABLE ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ASSESS THE ECOLOGICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF AES IN A LOWLAND ENGLISH RIVER BASIN. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF DISTANCE FROM RIVER IN OPTIMIZING AES FOR THE BIOLOGICAL HEATH AND CONSERVATION VALUE OF RIVERS. WE USED AQUATIC MACROINVERTEBRATES AS INDICATORS OF RIVER HEALTH AND CONSERVATION VALUE, TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF AES LIKELY TO IMPROVE RIVER HEALTH (HEREAFTER “AES RIVER OPTIONS”). THIS CATCHMENT IN LOWLAND ENGLAND HAD A VERY HIGH (OVER 80%) LEVEL OF UPTAKE OF ENTRY LEVEL AES, AND FACILITATED A COMPARISON BETWEEN SCHEMES THAT DO OR DO NOT CONTAIN AES RIVER OPTIONS. THE CONSERVATION VALUE OF MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES AND THE PROPORTION OF MACROINVERTEBRATES INTOLERANT OF WATER POLLUTION AND SEDIMENTATION INCREASED WITH HIGH PROPORTIONS OF WOODLAND WITHIN 100 M OR 500 M OF THE RIVER THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE UPSTREAM CATCHMENT. HIGH PROPORTIONS OF AES RIVER OPTIONS WITHIN THE SAME DISTANCE WERE CORRELATED WITH HIGHER PROPORTIONS OF SEDIMENT-SENSITIVE MACROINVERTEBRATES. WE CONCLUDE THAT FOR IMPROVING BIOLOGICAL QUALITY OR PROMOTING THE CONSERVATION VALUE OF RIVER COMMUNITIES, AES WILL BE OPTIMIZED BY PRESERVING WOODLAND WITHIN A 100–500 M BUFFER ZONE ALONG THE UPSTREAM LENGTH OF THE RIVER.","181","","157","168","DRAINAGE BASIN; ECOLOGY; WOODLAND; WATER FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE; BUFFER ZONE; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF AGRICULTURE; FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEM; AGRICULTURAL LAND; WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; HABITAT DESTRUCTION","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880913003149 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880913003149","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.AGEE.2013.09.015","","10.1016/j.agee.2013.09.015","2057109610","","0","016-461-892-552-161; 016-631-941-472-90X; 022-323-826-537-379; 023-712-567-399-631; 029-306-965-752-562; 038-659-320-814-260; 041-814-374-999-489; 041-941-668-970-181; 042-230-387-909-769; 044-327-313-877-518; 045-779-063-863-298; 046-030-741-698-909; 047-146-853-638-813; 047-796-888-487-503; 050-600-089-251-861; 051-853-654-321-466; 052-257-572-825-068; 056-588-614-107-307; 073-091-658-288-894; 074-890-248-163-869; 079-151-250-911-152; 080-601-414-471-191; 091-460-586-777-771; 093-987-299-721-330; 096-156-117-631-329; 096-196-209-039-855; 097-410-791-272-206; 104-999-209-744-439; 111-894-632-293-615; 114-209-543-271-546; 120-470-628-394-453; 136-078-117-326-445; 138-643-821-809-522; 155-238-296-972-934; 156-058-644-582-325; 157-618-960-651-205; 161-072-580-272-396; 177-444-187-753-543; 180-092-205-233-202","24","ALISON E.

FIELD MARGINS WERE SUBJECTED TO 10 GRASSLAND MANAGEMENT REGIMES, WHICH INCLUDED THE EFFECTS OF SPRAYING THE HERBICIDE GLYPHOSATE, CUTTING, LEAVING VEGETATION IN SITU AFTER THE CUT, SOWING AND A CONTROL. THESE TREATMENTS WERE RANDOMISED WITHIN SIX COMPLETE BLOCKS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD’S FARM AT WYTHAM. CUTTING VEGETATION HAD AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT ON NUMBER OF L. TENUIS IN BOTH SPRING AND SUMMER. CUTTING MARGINS IN SUMMER HAD A MORE PERSISTENT EFFECT ON POPULATIONS OF L. TENUIS THAN DID CUTTING MARGINS IN SPRING. THE EFFECT OF CUTTING WAS NOT MITIGATED BY LEAVING CUT VEGETATION IN SITU, BUT NO CUTTING ENSURED HIGHER NUMBER OF L. TENUIS IN MARGINS, AN INDICATION THAT HEIGHT AND STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY OF GRASSLAND VEGETATION WERE IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING POPULATION SIZE. SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER SPIDERS WERE FOUND IN JULY AND SEPTEMBER PLOTS WHICH HAD BEEN SPRAYED WITH HERBICIDE IN LATE JUNE/EARLY JULY. HOWEVER, SPIDER NUMBERS WERE NOT AFFECTED BY GLYPHOSATE APPLICATION WHEN SAMPLES WERE TAKEN NEARLY A YEAR LATER.

IN THIS PAPER, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF HEDGEROWS IN CENTRAL SPAIN, AND THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH ADJACENT FIELDS WERE STUDIED IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO MAINTAINING WOODY PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS IN THE CULTURAL LANDSCAPE. THE HEDGEROW TYPOLOGY OF THE REGION WERE FOUND TO RESPOND JOINTLY BOTH TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND LIVESTOCK FARMING-RELATED VARIATIONS IN ADJACENT LAND USES. THE VARIATION IN THE MANAGEMENT INTENSITY OF THE LANDSCAPE IS REFLECTED IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE WOODY PLANT SPECIES OF HEDGEROWS, VARYING FROM SPECIES OF OPEN LANDSCAPE TO WOODLAND SPECIES. MODERATE DEGREES OF GRAZING ALLOW FOR HIGHER VALUES OF WOODY PLANT RICHNESS IN HEDGEROWS COMPARED WITH THOSE HEDGEROWS SEPARATING SYSTEMS SUBJECTED TO A HIGHER LIVESTOCK LOADS OR TO ABANDONMENT PROCESSES. THUS, HEDGEROWS POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THESE CULTURAL LANDSCAPES AND PROVIDE A BASIS OF IMPORTANT ECOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL VALUE IN LANDSCAPE CONSERVATION PLANNING.

HOWEVER, ASSESSMENTS OF THEIR IMPACT ON FIELD-SCALE SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN CROP PERFORMANCE ARE RARE. A CASE OF PRACTICES AFFECTING SPATIAL CROP RESPONSE AT FIELD LEVEL IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY IS THE CONTOUR HEDGEROW SYSTEM, A WIDESPREAD SOIL CONSERVATION TECHNIQUE ON STEEP LANDS IN THE TROPICS. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY WERE TO ASSESS: (I) SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN CROP RESPONSE UNDER CONTOUR HEDGEROW SYSTEMS IN THE ANDES AND (II) IMPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT OF STEEP LAND ALLEY FARMING. IN ORDER TO MEASURE SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN CROP RESPONSE, TRITICUM AESTIVUM WAS SOWN IN ROWS FOLLOWING THE CONTOURS, PLACED EVERY 25 CM ALONG THE SLOPE DIRECTION. GRAIN YIELD WAS MONITORED ON EIGHT ALLEYS, HAVING SLOPES FROM 15 TO 30%, A LENGTH OF 4–8 M AND SOILS RANGING FROM DYSTRI-VERTIC CAMBISOLS TO HAPLIC PHAEOZEM, IN THE ANDES REGION OF ECUADOR. IN ORDER TO RELATE CROP RESPONSE WITH SOIL FERTILITY, SOIL SAMPLING WAS CARRIED OUT IN BANDS FOLLOWING THE CONTOUR. TOP SOIL PROPERTIES, SUCH AS ORGANIC CARBON, N TOTAL , NO 3 − , P, EXCHANGEABLE ALUMINIUM, P FIXATION, EXCHANGEABLE BASES, CEC AND TEXTURE, WERE ANALYSED. THE BARRIER STRIPS OF THE CONTOUR HEDGEROW SYSTEMS WERE COMPOSED OF: (I) PENNISETUM CLANDESTINUM AND LOLIUM MULTIFLORUM OR (II) PHALARIS TUBEROSA . SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN CROP RESPONSE WAS DESCRIBED BY FOURTH-ORDER POLYNOMIAL EQUATIONS, WHERE POSITION IN THE ALLEY WAS THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE AND PLANT CHARACTERISTICS WERE THE DEPENDENT VARIABLES. GRAIN YIELD RANGED FROM 0.8 TO 4.0 T HA −1 (NET AREA). CLEAR AND SIGNIFICANT PATTERNS OF SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN CROP RESPONSE WERE FOUND IN ALL ALLEYS, WITH R 2 VARYING FROM 0.55 TO 0.90. CROP RESPONSE WAS STRONGLY AND POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH NO 3 − , P, EXCHANGEABLE BASES OR ORGANIC CARBON, DEPENDENT ON THE MANAGEMENT, AGE AND SOIL CONDITIONS OF THE ALLEYS. TILLAGE EROSION AND SOIL ACCUMULATION ON RESPECTIVELY THE UPPER AND LOWER ELEVATIONS OF THE ALLEYS WERE THE MAIN CAUSES FOR A TENDENCY TO A SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED CROP RESPONSE ALONG THE SLOPE DIRECTION. HOWEVER, ACCORDING THE TYPE OF GRASS USED IN THE BARRIER STRIP, COMPETITION FOR SOIL FERTILITY AND SOIL MOISTURE OCCURRED AND INFLUENCED IN NEGATIVE WAY CROP PRODUCTIVITY IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS OF THE ALLEYS. AN INDEX IS PROPOSED TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF CONTOUR HEDGEROWS ON CROP RESPONSE. THE PRESENT STUDY SHOWS THAT CONTOUR HEDGEROW SYSTEMS CANNOT ALWAYS BE EVALUATED AS COMPLETELY POSITIVE. SOIL FERTILITY IMPROVEMENT ON THE UPPER PART OF THE ALLEYS AND A BETTER MANAGEMENT OF THE BARRIER STRIP ARE SUGGESTED TO ENHANCE CROP PRODUCTIVITY OF CONTOUR HEDGEROW SYSTEMS.","86","1","15","26","SOIL CONSERVATION; EROSION; SOIL SCIENCE; SOIL WATER; TILLAGE; TOPSOIL; PHAEOZEM; SOIL FERTILITY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; AGRONOMY; SPATIAL VARIABILITY","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167198705000516 http://dspace.ucuenca.edu.ec/bitstream/123456789/22080/1/scopus%20176.pdf http://core.ac.uk/display/34294855 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/2864918 http://dspace.ucuenca.edu.ec/handle/123456789/22080","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.STILL.2005.01.017","","10.1016/j.still.2005.01.017","2020842979","","0","029-657-450-478-01X; 042-636-165-389-067; 043-891-092-451-521; 055-842-500-678-050; 056-469-665-362-162; 059-003-128-993-115; 067-141-650-949-112; 069-331-170-591-756; 070-008-702-916-976; 075-980-342-562-87X; 080-321-243-422-726; 083-863-992-943-057; 095-023-750-794-099; 103-893-186-269-601; 117-140-699-057-358; 120-287-757-796-357; 125-082-642-394-270; 167-915-069-389-889; 187-118-162-708-884; 189-664-585-315-530; 192-341-972-259-42X","55","GERD DERCON; JOZEF DECKERS; JEAN POESEN; GERARD GOVERS; H SANCHEZ; MARCO RAMÍREZ; RAÚL VANEGAS; E TACURI; G LOAIZA","SOIL AND TILLAGE RESEARCH","SOIL AND TILLAGE RESEARCH","","LENS",0,"DERCON G, 2006, SOIL AND TILLAGE RESEARCH","DERCON G, 2006, SOIL AND TILLAGE RESEARCH"

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GRASSY STRIPS AT THE MARGINS OF ARABLE FIELDS IS AN AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEME THAT AIMS TO PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR NATIVE FLORA AND FAUNA AND THUS INCREASE FARMLAND BIODIVERSITY. THESE MARGINS CAN BE MANAGED TO TARGET CERTAIN GROUPS, SUCH AS FARMLAND BIRDS AND POLLINATORS, BUT THE IMPACT OF SUCH MANAGEMENT ON THE SOIL FAUNA HAS BEEN POORLY STUDIED. THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECT OF SEED MIX AND MANAGEMENT ON THE BIODIVERSITY, CONSERVATION AND FUNCTIONAL VALUE OF FIELD MARGINS FOR SOIL MACROFAUNA. 2. EXPERIMENTAL MARGIN PLOTS WERE ESTABLISHED IN 2001 IN A WINTER WHEAT FIELD IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE, UK, USING A FACTORIAL DESIGN OF THREE SEED MIXES AND THREE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES [SPRING CUT, HERBICIDE APPLICATION AND SOIL DISTURBANCE (SCARIFICATION)]. IN SPRING AND AUTUMN 2005, SOIL CORES TAKEN FROM THE MARGIN PLOTS AND THE CROP WERE HAND-SORTED FOR SOIL MACROFAUNA. THE LUMBRICIDAE, ISOPODA, CHILOPODA, DIPLOPODA, CARABIDAE AND STAPHYLINIDAE WERE IDENTIFIED TO SPECIES AND CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO FEEDING TYPE. 3. DIVERSITY IN THE FIELD MARGINS WAS GENERALLY HIGHER THAN IN THE CROP, WITH THE LUMBRICIDAE, ISOPODA AND COLEOPTERA HAVING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SPECIES AND/OR HIGHER ABUNDANCES IN THE MARGINS. WITHIN THE MARGINS, MANAGEMENT HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE SOIL MACROFAUNA, WITH SCARIFIED PLOTS CONTAINING LOWER ABUNDANCES AND FEWER SPECIES OF ISOPODS. THE SPECIES COMPOSITION OF THE SCARIFIED PLOTS WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE CROP. 4. SCARIFICATION ALSO REDUCED SOIL- AND LITTER-FEEDER ABUNDANCES AND PREDATOR SPECIES DENSITIES, ALTHOUGH POPULATIONS APPEARED TO RECOVER BY THE AUTUMN, PROBABLY AS A RESULT OF DISPERSAL FROM NEIGHBOURING PLOTS AND BOUNDARY FEATURES. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE RESPONSES OF THESE FEEDING GROUPS FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ARE DISCUSSED. 5. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THEIR VALUE FOR SOIL MACROFAUNA. IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE THE LITTER-DWELLING INVERTEBRATES THAT TEND TO BE MISSING FROM ARABLE SYSTEMS, AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES SHOULD AIM TO MINIMIZE SOIL CULTIVATION AND DEVELOP A SUBSTANTIAL SURFACE LITTER LAYER. HOWEVER, THIS MAY CONFLICT WITH OTHER AIMS OF THESE SCHEMES, SUCH AS ENHANCING FLORISTIC AND POLLINATOR DIVERSITY.","45","1","269","278","FAUNA; BIODIVERSITY; SOIL WATER; ECOLOGY; LITTER; LUMBRICIDAE; BIOLOGICAL DISPERSAL; SOIL BIOLOGY; ARABLE LAND; BIOLOGY","","","","","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01433.x/full https://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND44005259 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01433.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01433.x https://www.jstor.org/stable/20143973 http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/9185/","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1365-2664.2007.01433.X","","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01433.x","1563004395","","0","001-575-548-525-27X; 012-183-047-887-156; 013-470-213-401-798; 016-232-750-481-776; 017-786-901-727-296; 020-564-612-156-583; 022-526-631-372-455; 026-162-389-848-750; 030-453-266-652-445; 031-579-378-413-334; 035-350-419-524-672; 040-170-064-833-822; 042-303-914-852-499; 043-879-605-645-910; 045-327-551-062-265; 048-888-393-075-616; 050-364-885-261-831; 051-528-883-280-881; 056-099-523-856-735; 056-585-869-238-25X; 056-789-845-462-569; 058-105-561-757-413; 063-617-276-329-073; 064-255-371-732-136; 066-561-161-953-166; 074-793-529-288-006; 077-911-524-409-482; 080-139-567-968-521; 086-797-670-278-652; 089-224-342-698-288; 091-138-428-230-61X; 094-442-752-754-939; 098-719-657-126-04X; 106-051-677-401-185; 110-673-327-117-273; 116-073-484-834-128; 117-037-973-424-857; 117-345-687-903-78X; 118-807-690-083-030; 119-089-019-715-348; 121-691-035-270-645; 121-732-999-502-12X; 122-528-143-728-138; 123-841-301-855-392; 125-305-681-059-534; 125-786-651-769-041; 127-029-369-930-692; 128-760-888-268-265; 134-783-595-645-599; 136-816-007-966-101; 137-193-830-786-041; 142-547-556-180-595; 145-653-851-729-665; 153-093-532-626-009; 160-898-580-838-366; 167-613-411-928-937; 183-044-272-459-669; 190-678-631-976-253","94","JO SMITH; SIMON G.

THESE PROPERTIES ARE PRONE TO CHANGES CAUSED BY NATURAL FORCES AND HUMAN ACTIVITY. THE HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES OF THE SURFACE SOIL GREATLY IMPACT THE GENERATION OF SURFACE RUNOFF AND ACCOMPANIED EROSION, THE MAJOR CONCERN OF AGRICULTURAL WATER PROTECTION.; ; THE GENERAL TARGET OF THIS THESIS WAS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRUCTURAL AND HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES OF BOREAL CLAY SOILS. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF A CLAYEY SURFACE SOIL (0–10 CM, CLAY CONTENT 51%), WITH A MICACEOUS/ILLITIC MINERALOGY SUBJECTED TO THREE DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES OF PERENNIAL VEGETATION, WERE STUDIED. TEE STUDY SITES WERE VEGETATED BUFFER ZONES LOCATED SIDE BY SIDE IN SW FINLAND: 1) NATURAL VEGETATION WITH NO MANAGEMENT, 2) HARVESTED ONCE A YEAR, AND 3) GRAZED BY CATTLE. THE SOIL STRUCTURE, HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES, SHRINKAGE PROPERTIES AND SOIL WATER REPELLENCY WERE DETERMINED AT ALL SITES.; ; TWO DISTINCT FLOW DOMAINS WERE EVIDENT. THE SURFACE SOIL WAS CHARACTERIZED BY SUBANGULAR BLOCKY, ANGULAR BLOCKY AND PLATY AGGREGATES. HENCE, LARGE, PARTIALLY ACCOMMODATED, IRREGULAR ELONGATED PORES DOMINATED THE MACROPORE DOMAIN AT ALL SITES. THE INTRA-AGGREGATE PORE SYSTEM WAS MOSTLY COMPRISED OF PORES SMALLER THAN 30 ΜM, WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WATER STORAGE. MACROPORES AT THE GRAZED SITE, COMPACTED BY HOOF PRESSURE, WERE HORIZONTALLY ORIENTED AND PORE CONNECTIVITY WAS POOREST, WHICH DECREASED WATER AND AIR FLUX COMPARED WITH OTHER SITES.; ; DRYING OF THE SOIL GREATLY ALTERED ITS STRUCTURE. THE DECREASE IN SOIL VOLUME BETWEEN WET AND DRY SOIL WAS 7–10%, MOST OF WHICH OCCURRED IN THE MOISTURE RANGE OF FIELD CONDITIONS. STRUCTURAL CHANGES, INCLUDING IRREVERSIBLE COLLAPSE OF INTERAGGREGATE PORES, BEGAN AT MATRIC POTENTIALS AROUND -6 KPA INDICATING, INSTABILITY OF SOIL STRUCTURE AGAINST INCREASING HYDRAULIC STRESS. WATER SATURATION AND SEVERAL FREEZETHAW CYCLES BETWEEN AUTUMN AND SPRING LIKELY WEAKENED THE SOIL STRUCTURE.; ; SOIL WATER REPELLENCY WAS OBSERVED AT ALL SITES AT THE TIME OF SAMPLING AND WHEN SOIL WAS DRYER THAN ABOUT 40 VOL.%. (MATRIC POTENTIAL < -6 KPA).THEREFORE, WATER REPELLENCY CONTRIBUTES TO WATER ?OW OVER A WIDE MOISTURE RANGE. WATER REPELLENCY WAS ALSO OBSERVED IN SOILS WITH LOW ORGANIC CARBON CONTENT (< 2%), WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THIS PHENOMENON IS COMMON IN AGRICULTURAL SOILS OF FINLAND DUE TO THEIR RELATIVELY HIGH ORGANIC CARBON CONTENT.; ; AGGREGATE-RELATED PEDOFEATURES OF DENSE INFILLINGS DESCRIBED AS CLAY INTRUSIONS WERE FOUND AT ALL SITES. THE FORMATION OF THESE INTRUSIONS WAS ATTRIBUTED TO CLAY DISPERSION AND/OR TRANSLOCATION DURING SPRING THAW AND DRYING OF THE SUSPENSION IN SITU. THESE PROCESSES GENERATE VERY NEW AGGREGATES WHOSE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES ARE MOST PROBABLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE BULK SOIL AGGREGATES. FORMATION OF THE CLAY INFILLINGS SUGGESTED THAT PROLONGED WETNESS IN AUTUMN AND SPRING IMPAIRS SOIL STRUCTURE DUE TO CLAY DISPERSION, WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE PEDOGENESIS OF THE SOIL.; ; THE RESULTS EMPHASIZE THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF CLAY SOILS, ESSENTIALLY DRIVEN BY THEIR MOISTURE STATE. IN A DRY SOIL, FAST PREFERENTIAL FLOW IS FAVOURED BY ABUNDANT MACROPORES INCLUDING SHRINKAGE CRACKS AND IS FURTHER ENHANCED BY WATER REPELLENCY. INCREASE IN SOIL MOISTURE REDUCES WATER REPELLENCY, AND SWELLING OF ACCOMMODATED PORES LOWERS THE SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY.

TWO MAIN ECOLOGICAL GRADIENTS WERE RECOGNIZED ACCORDING TO STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. RELATIONSHIPS OF SPECIES OCCURRENCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS WERE INTERPRETED ACCORDING TO THEIR MAIN LIFE TRAITS. THE FIRST ECOLOGICAL GRADIENT CLEARLY DIFFERENTIATED COMMUNITIES FROM HEDGES TO THOSE OF GRASS-DOMINATED LINEAR BANKS. THIS FIRST GRADIENT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVALENCE OF FOREST VERSUS GRASSLAND RODENT SPECIES. THIS PARTITIONING SEEMS TO REFLECT RATHER ECOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS OF SPECIES THAN COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS. SMALL RODENTS DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE WERE INVERSELY EVOLVING ALONG THIS GRADIENT. THE SECOND FACTOR INFLUENCING SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES WAS ASSOCIATED TO LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY SURROUNDING THE PERMANENT HABITATS. ACCORDING TO THIS SECOND GRADIENT, SPECIES SEEMED TO BE SELECTED IN RELATION TO THEIR ABILITY TO DISPERSE AND TO USE CULTIVATED FIELDS.

FIELDS WERE SPLIT INTO HALVES, ONE BEING SOWN WITH A GMHT CROP AND THE OTHER WITH THE EQUIVALENT CONVENTIONAL NON-GMHT CROP. MARGIN VEGETATION WAS RECORDED IN THREE COMPONENTS OF THE FIELD MARGINS. MOST DIFFERENCES WERE IN THE TILLED AREA, WITH FEWER SMALLER EFFECTS MIRRORING THEM IN THE VERGE AND BOUNDARY. IN SPRING OILSEED RAPE FIELDS, THE COVER, FLOWERING AND SEEDING OF PLANTS WERE 25%, 44% AND 39% LOWER, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE GMHT UNCROPPED TILLED MARGINS. SIMILARLY, FOR BEET, FLOWERING AND SEEDING WERE 34% AND 39% LOWER, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE GMHT MARGINS. FOR MAIZE, THE EFFECT WAS REVERSED, WITH PLANT COVER AND FLOWERING 28% AND 67% GREATER, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE GMHT HALF.

AT 100 M FROM THE FOREST EDGE, VOLES WERE TWICE MORE ABUNDANT THAN AT 50 M, FOUR TIMES MORE THAN AT 25 M AND EIGHT TIMES MORE THAN AT 5 M. IN PERMANENT GRASSLAND, THE EDGE EFFECT WAS SUCH THAT VOLES WERE PRACTICALLY ABSENT UP TO 100 M FROM THE FOREST EDGE. FOR BOTH TYPES OF GRASSLAND, THE EDGE EFFECT WAS MORE PRONOUNCED FOR FOREST HABITAT THAN FOR HEDGEROWS, THAT IS, FOR ELEMENTS WITH A LARGE SURFACE AREA OF WOODED ENVIRONMENT.

IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE OBJECTIVES OF WATER FRAME DIRECTIVE 2000/60/CE THERE HAVE BEEN SEARCHED METHODS FOR MITIGATION THE NUTRIENT POLLUTION FROM SLOPE SOILS. THESE METHODS ARE: - THE USING OF ORGANIC - MINERAL FERTILIZERS (L120) INSTEAD OF SOLUBLE PHOSPHORUS FERTILIZERS (SUPERPHOSPHATES); - BUFFER STRIPS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLOPE;- FILTERING MATERIALS FOR WATER FROM CREEKS. THE APPLYING OF THESE METHODS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REDUCTION OF THE NUTRIENT LOSSES (NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS) FROM SLOPE SOILS WITH VALUES RANGING BETWEEN 38-41% BY APPLYING ORGANIC - MINERAL FERTILIZER AND BY 52-64% WHEN BUFFER STRIPS WERE INSTALLED. THE USING OF STRAW BALLOTS AS FILTERING MATERIALS FOR CREEK WATER HAS DETERMINED THE REDUCTION OF NUTRIENT LOSSES BY 72%. THIS WAY, THE USING OF ORGANIC - MINERAL FERTILIZER ON LIGNITE BASE (L-120) HAS DETERMINED THE DIMINISHING OF PHOSPHORUS LOSSES ON SLOPE SOILS DUE TO BONDING PHOSPHORUS FROM THIS FERTILIZER IN AN ORGANIC - MINERAL MATRIX THAT SPEEDS UP THE RETROGRADATION AND SOLUBILISATION PROCESSES OF PHOSPHORUS. THE USING OF GRASS BUFFER STRIPS OF 10 M WIDE ON LEVEL CURVES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLOPE ALONG PREAJBA CREEK HAS DETERMINED AN OBVIOUS DECREASING OF THE ERODED SOIL QUANTITY, OF HUMUS AND NUTRIENT LOSSES DUE TO BETTER RETENTION BY ROOT SYSTEM AND ITS HIGHER DENSITY. STRAW BALLOTS ACROSS THE COURSE OF A CREEK ARE A GOOD FILTER FOR RUNNING WATERS. THE STRAW ACTION IS SIMILAR WITH SOIL COLLOIDAL COMPLEX, THEY RETAIN CHEMICAL IONS FROM WATER LIKE: NO3, NH4, K, PO4, ETC. BY USING STRAW BALLOTS THERE CAN BE AVOIDED THE EUTROPHICATION PHENOMENON OF THE SURFACE WATERS. THE USING OF CROPS LIKE NATURAL AND SOWN PASTURE AS WELL AS CEREALS COULD BE A METHOD TO MITIGATE NUTRIENT LOSSES ON SLOPES.

WE INVESTIGATED THE SOIL PROPERTIES, NUTRIENT DYNAMICS AND VEGETATION COMPOSITION AT THE RIPARIAN–AGRICULTURE INTERFACE. SOIL PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND VEGETATION PROPERTIES WERE SPATIALLY HETEROGENEOUS ALONG THE TRANSITION FROM THE GRAZED PADDOCK INTO THE UN-GRAZED AND REVEGETATED RIPARIAN ZONE. SOIL C STOCKS VARIED CONSIDERABLY ACROSS THE SITE, WITH VALUES RANGING FROM 2% IN THE PADDOCK TO 5% IN THE RIPARIAN ZONE. USING BAYESIAN MODEL SELECTION, A PREDICTIVE MODEL FOR TOTAL SOIL CARBON WAS DEVELOPED. BY INCLUDING SOIL MOISTURE CONTENT AND CANOPY COVER IN THE MODEL, IT WAS POSSIBLE TO PREDICT TOTAL SOIL CARBON WITH 80% ACCURACY AT THE SITE LEVEL AND 87% AT THE TRANSECT LEVEL. THIS OPENS UP THE POTENTIAL FOR TOTAL SOIL CARBON LEVELS TO BE ESTIMATED BY THE QUANTIFICATION OF EASILY MEASURED ECOSYSTEM PROPERTIES. ANALYSIS OF THE CHEMICAL NATURE OF THE CARBON IN THESES SOILS BY SOLID STATE 13C NMR SPECTROSCOPY, SHOWED THE PRESENCE OF MORE RECALCITRANT FORMS OF CARBON IN THE REVEGETATED RIPARIAN ZONE COMPARED TO THE GRAZED PADDOCK. SPATIAL PATTERNS OF SOIL MINERAL N POOLS WERE HIGHLY VARIABLE ( NO 4 + − N RANGED FROM 1 TO 5 ΜG/G DRY SOIL; NO 3 − − N RANGED FROM 0.4 TO 2.2 ΜG/G DRY SOIL); HOWEVER, CLEAR PATTERNS IN POTENTIALLY MINERALIZABLE N (PMN) WERE OBSERVED, WITH RATES OF PMN IN THE PADDOCK BEING LESS THAN HALF OF THOSE ADJACENT TO THE STREAM IN THE RIPARIAN ZONE. RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF SOIL PROCESSES AT THE AGRICULTURE – RIPARIAN INTERFACE, AND THE POTENTIAL TO DEVELOP MODELS TO PREDICT SOIL CARBON USING EASILY MEASURABLE VEGETATION AND SOIL PROPERTIES.","49","","38","45","ECOSYSTEM; RIPARIAN ZONE; NUTRIENT; SOIL RESPIRATION; SOIL SCIENCE; SOIL WATER; SOIL TYPE; VEGETATION; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SOIL CARBON","","","","SCHOOL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, MONASH UNIVERSITY; MURRAY DARLING BASIN AUTHORITY","https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/spatial-patterns-of-and-environmental-controls-on-soil-properties https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/85276 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071712000594 https://researchprofiles.canberra.edu.au/en/publications/spatial-patterns-of-and-environmental-controls-on-soil-properties https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND44711719","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.SOILBIO.2012.02.007","","10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.02.007","1996038362","","0","000-689-702-074-331; 001-795-263-587-703; 002-275-102-975-34X; 002-509-409-482-215; 003-070-455-950-76X; 004-681-753-085-507; 005-222-102-566-554; 010-721-728-527-802; 011-518-513-609-045; 013-804-069-132-745; 014-424-124-887-035; 015-325-416-202-141; 015-342-032-824-51X; 015-514-563-181-208; 015-663-738-126-876; 016-497-800-437-698; 017-790-054-259-381; 018-777-402-329-391; 019-059-307-571-358; 023-347-970-237-621; 024-654-113-296-068; 026-982-189-141-084; 028-523-723-732-969; 030-978-497-436-303; 031-761-918-218-654; 033-786-985-984-424; 034-937-691-844-161; 037-655-209-344-331; 038-957-837-584-985; 046-884-682-520-13X; 047-944-768-655-674; 050-422-766-249-680; 055-445-976-825-678; 059-115-205-484-223; 059-320-896-313-943; 063-195-664-323-047; 063-431-083-337-274; 063-905-394-853-542; 064-336-761-270-306; 068-295-058-229-480; 069-215-520-224-22X; 072-198-130-972-325; 073-681-033-142-000; 075-207-343-378-670; 077-138-259-642-965; 081-030-794-566-327; 084-585-749-983-736; 084-940-408-826-883; 089-365-869-459-178; 098-936-549-472-982; 098-962-715-174-163; 101-990-703-232-260; 102-215-185-600-703; 102-274-227-250-423; 110-713-293-177-238; 118-128-311-468-279; 119-917-653-547-784; 120-795-373-876-586; 138-125-520-594-759; 145-866-195-493-445; 149-006-883-920-063; 165-628-763-557-921; 169-993-554-881-216; 186-248-770-128-006","31","MERRYN SMITH; PELLEGRINO CONTE; ANNE E.

THROUGH THIS STUDY WE AIMED TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO INCREASE BIODIVERSITY IN BUFFER ZONES. THE STUDY INCLUDED 15 BUFFER ZONES WITHIN A SINGLE LANDSCAPE. MEAN SPECIES RICHNESS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE GROUP OF SITES GRAZED OVER SEVERAL YEARS (21 SPECIES) IN CONTRAST TO EXTENSIVELY CUT SITES (14.8 SPECIES) AND/OR GRAZED SITES (18 SPECIES). SPECIES HETEROGENEITY DID NOT RESPOND TO DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT REGIMES. MANAGEMENT, SLOPE ASPECT AND LITTER WERE SIGNIFICANT EXPLANATORY FACTORS FOR SPECIES COMPOSITION. THE AMOUNT OF SOIL PHOSPHORUS MEASURED AT THREE DIFFERENT DEPTHS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE BUFFER ZONES MANAGED BY CUTTING OR GRAZING FOR A FEW YEARS IN CONTRAST TO THOSE THAT WERE GRAZED FOR SEVERAL YEARS. MANAGEMENT THAT POSITIVELY AFFECTED SPECIES DIVERSITY DID NOT RESULT IN THE EXPECTED DECREASE IN SOIL PHOSPHORUS.

THE VARIATION IN TAXONOMIC COMPOSITION, COMMUNITY ATTRIBUTES AND TROPHIC STRUCTURE OF FISH ASSEMBLAGES FROM STREAMS UNDER DIFFERENT RIPARIAN ZONE PRESERVATION CONDITIONS WERE STUDIED. NINE STREAM REACHES UNDER THE FOLLOWING RIPARIAN VEGETATION CONDITIONS WERE SELECTED: NATIVE FOREST (NF), WITH MOSTLY PRIMARY FOREST; SECONDARY FOREST (SF), WHICH INCLUDED SITES WITH VEGETATION IN AN ADVANCED STAGE OF REGENERATION SURROUNDED BY SUGARCANE PLANTATIONS; AND SUGARCANE SITES (SC), LOCATED IN AREAS WITHOUT RIPARIAN VEGETATION, ADJACENT TO SUGARCANE CROPS. FORTY-ONE SPECIES WERE COLLECTED. THE VARIANCE PARTITIONING AND PARTIAL REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS (PRDA) INDICATED THAT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND TROPHIC STRUCTURE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPLAINED BY RIPARIAN CONDITION AND SPATIAL VARIATIONS, WHILE DIVERSITY, RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE AND BIOMASS WERE ONLY EXPLAINED BY SEASON AND SPACE, WITH HIGHER DIVERSITY AND RICHNESS AT THE SF SITES. ABUNDANCE-BIOMASS CURVES (ABC CURVES) SUGGESTED THAT SUGARCANE PLANTATIONS DESTABILIZED FISH ASSEMBLAGES, ESPECIALLY AT THE MORE INTENSIVELY MANAGED SITES, WHICH SEEM TO INFLUENCE STREAM INTEGRITY AND ASSOCIATED FISH FAUNA. WE CONCLUDED THAT BOTH PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF STREAMS AND SOME ATTRIBUTES OF FISH COMMUNITIES REFLECTED THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PRESERVATION OF THE RIPARIAN BUFFERS, BUT GIVEN THE INFLUENCE OF REGIONAL PROCESSES WHICH HAVE A PERVASIVE ROLE IN SHAPING LOCAL ASSEMBLAGES, LAND USE AT THE WATERSHED SCALE SEEMED TO BE IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY TO EXPLAIN THE HIGHER RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY FOUND AT THE SF SITES.","98","8","1895","1912","BIOMASS (ECOLOGY); RIPARIAN ZONE; OLD-GROWTH FOREST; SECONDARY FOREST; VEGETATION; ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; SPECIES RICHNESS; AGROFORESTRY; SPECIES DIVERSITY; TROPHIC LEVEL","","","","","https://www.bv.fapesp.br/en/publicacao/108664/assessing-the-importance-of-the-riparian-zone-for-stream-fis/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10641-015-0406-4/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10641-015-0406-4 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153285399 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/4394803","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1007/S10641-015-0406-4","","10.1007/s10641-015-0406-4","1981295327","","0","001-119-833-238-908; 001-141-218-793-388; 002-566-488-175-248; 003-171-724-444-914; 003-828-350-015-536; 005-073-055-538-326; 007-751-641-582-496; 008-583-288-343-270; 010-304-324-945-621; 010-897-871-428-494; 013-053-656-704-352; 013-228-412-257-762; 014-247-748-409-336; 015-342-032-824-51X; 015-764-269-828-682; 016-720-816-366-715; 018-797-363-505-484; 019-026-359-992-284; 019-065-946-135-668; 020-424-424-061-013; 020-630-627-088-31X; 022-918-849-279-15X; 023-205-757-860-322; 023-489-529-211-555; 023-650-799-291-696; 024-945-044-153-791; 026-585-485-948-932; 029-264-530-643-997; 029-386-831-957-40X; 032-461-732-375-661; 032-961-767-789-531; 035-093-656-083-327; 036-334-291-932-197; 036-749-081-343-479; 039-172-718-674-79X; 039-251-416-279-052; 042-036-539-281-458; 043-784-111-122-333; 045-304-006-438-587; 045-739-664-884-434; 045-818-830-294-17X; 046-520-504-626-786; 047-089-650-693-822; 047-800-807-474-540; 048-818-224-648-416; 050-813-918-820-312; 052-334-333-625-946; 052-434-564-418-432; 055-386-300-233-43X; 061-359-597-187-246; 062-840-277-915-897; 065-243-399-060-376; 066-318-658-327-89X; 067-256-246-817-599; 068-051-732-934-472; 070-024-067-817-548; 075-310-223-214-175; 080-055-492-305-521; 081-240-152-729-265; 082-121-932-561-402; 085-959-277-823-856; 086-802-354-961-613; 090-176-681-950-734; 090-857-350-394-204; 098-207-542-666-960; 101-972-318-570-424; 104-441-312-226-717; 104-529-546-001-437; 106-097-003-134-387; 108-159-820-046-364; 109-280-597-605-629; 109-645-497-961-115; 112-155-295-547-828; 114-134-813-729-913; 119-139-897-303-411; 120-138-371-686-172; 120-871-791-484-413; 122-154-985-613-384; 122-936-707-834-079; 123-337-490-665-80X; 124-548-416-367-157; 128-373-399-847-303; 128-498-727-256-916; 129-760-874-861-398; 130-522-423-394-518; 135-218-961-934-644; 139-432-224-057-058; 140-201-605-957-524; 148-437-157-711-433; 150-325-162-873-23X; 150-443-926-207-649; 150-913-091-793-742; 155-238-296-972-934; 163-699-856-957-831; 169-358-463-559-157; 174-261-044-357-737; 176-100-710-487-88X; 184-962-236-860-868; 189-006-079-832-653; 197-396-386-762-655; 199-662-893-082-47X","29","FERNANDA BASTOS DOS SANTOS; FABIO COP FERREIRA; KATHARINA EICHBAUM ESTEVES","ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES","ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES","","LENS",0,"SANTOS FB, 2015, ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES","SANTOS FB, 2015, ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES"

IF PROPERLY DESIGNED, THEY CAN PROVIDE MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS BY INCREASING WILDLIFE HABITATS AND BIODIVERSITY. LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE EFFECTS OF BUFFER STRIPS ON SOIL QUALITY. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENT BUFFER DESIGNS ON SOIL BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS AND TO DEFINE RELEVANT QUALITY PARAMETERS FOR SOIL MONITORING. WE COMPARED FOUR BUFFER ARRANGEMENTS: 3 M WIDE GRASS BUFFER; 3 M GRASS WITH ONE TREE ROW; 6 M GRASS WITH ONE TREE ROW; 6 M GRASS WITH TWO TREE ROWS; PLUS TWO CONTROLS: AN ADJACENT MAIZE CROP FIELD AND A PLOT WITHOUT BUFFER. BUFFERS WERE ESTABLISHED 13 YEARS AGO AT THE PADUA UNIVERSITY EXPERIMENTAL FARM IN THE PO VALLEY, NORTH-EAST ITALY. STUDIED PARAMETERS INCLUDED SOIL ORGANIC MATTER COMPOSITION AND SOIL MICROBIAL AND ENZYMATIC ASSAYS. AS EXPECTED, CONTROL PLOTS SHOWED THE LOWEST VALUES FOR ALL THE STUDIED PARAMETERS.

NON-CROP CORRIDORS MAY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE THE CONNECTIVITY FOR ARTHROPOD PREDATORS IN CROPLAND LANDSCAPES, ESPECIALLY FOR SPECIES THAT REQUIRE MULTIPLE HABITATS, SUCH AS CAVITY-NESTING WASPS WHICH USE WOODED HABITAT FOR NESTING AND GRASSLAND HABITAT FOR FORAGING. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF CORRIDORS IN NONEXPERIMENTAL LANDSCAPES HAVE BEEN RARELY EXAMINED. WE STUDIED THE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF CAVITY-NESTING WASPS AND THEIR PARASITOIDS IN STANDARDIZED TRAP NESTS LOCATED IN THREE HABITAT TYPES (FOREST EDGE, HEDGE, GRASS STRIP) AND IN THREE GRASS-STRIP TYPES (CONNECTED TO A FOREST EDGE, SLIGHTLY ISOLATED, HIGHLY ISOLATED FROM A FOREST EDGE). SPECIES RICHNESS AND THE ABUNDANCE OF WASPS (HYMENOPTERA: SPHECIDAE, EUMENIDAE, POMPILIDAE) WERE HIGHEST AT FOREST EDGES, WHICH PROVIDE NATURAL NESTING SITES, AND LOWEST IN GRASS STRIPS, WITH FEW NATURAL NESTING SITES. WASP ABUNDANCE IN GRASS STRIPS CONNECTED TO FOREST EDGES WAS 270% HIGHER THAN IN SLIGHTLY ISOLATED GRASS STRIPS AND 600% HIGHER THAN IN HIGHLY ISOLATED GRASS STRIPS. THE ABUNDANCE OF CATERPILLAR-HUNTING EUMENID WASPS WAS 600% HIGHER IN CONNECTED GRASS STRIPS THAN IN SLIGHTLY AND HIGHLY ISOLATED GRASS STRIPS. SPECIES RICHNESS OF WASPS WAS ENHANCED BY 180% IN CONNECTED GRASS STRIPS COMPARED TO HIGHLY ISOLATED GRASS STRIPS. PARASITISM RATES WERE NOT DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY HABITAT OR GRASS-STRIP TYPE, BUT INCREASED WITH INCREASING PARASITOID DIVERSITY THAT WAS HIGHER AT FOREST EDGES THAN IN GRASS STRIPS. WE CONCLUDE THAT GRASS-STRIP CORRIDORS ENHANCE THE COLONIZATION OF NESTING SITES, PRESUMABLY BY FACILITATING WASP MOVEMENTS. IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES, WHERE NESTING SITES ARE LIMITED AND FOOD AVAILABILITY CHANGES FREQUENTLY, RAPID COLONIZATION OF NESTS MAY ENHANCE POPULATION VIABILITY. HIGHER WASP ABUNDANCE IN CONNECTED NESTING SITES MAY BE DIRECTLY LINKED TO HIGHER BIOCONTROL OF PEST CATERPILLARS WITHIN THE FORAGING RANGE AROUND NESTS. ALTHOUGH GRASS STRIPS CAN REDUCE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION, NON-CROP HABITATS SUCH AS FOREST HABITATS AND HEDGES PROVIDING NESTING SITES ARE REQUIRED WITHIN THE HOME RANGE OF WASPS TO ALLOW REPRODUCTION IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES.","19","1","123","132","HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; FORAGING; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; PARASITOID; SPHECIDAE; HYMENOPTERA; POPULATION; SPECIES RICHNESS; BIOLOGY","","AGRICULTURE/METHODS; ANIMALS; ECOSYSTEM; HOST-PARASITE INTERACTIONS; NESTING BEHAVIOR/PHYSIOLOGY; PEST CONTROL, BIOLOGICAL; POACEAE; PREDATORY BEHAVIOR; TREES; WASPS/PARASITOLOGY","","","https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/08-0384.1 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/2159578 https://eref.uni-bayreuth.de/16299/ http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/08-0384.1/abstract https://europepmc.org/article/MED/19323177 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19323177 http://www.bayceer.uni-bayreuth.de/bayceer/de/pub/pub/68215/EcolAppl2009,19_123-132_Holzschuh_et-al.pdf https://www.jstor.org/stable/27645953 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093076257 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/08-0384.1","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1890/08-0384.1","19323177","10.1890/08-0384.1","1986454600","","0","000-470-717-455-915; 001-246-459-283-910; 001-555-373-960-238; 002-874-438-870-319; 003-164-963-858-748; 004-355-918-923-334; 004-916-984-876-81X; 008-225-619-668-580; 008-291-203-169-732; 009-798-888-154-531; 011-113-313-615-090; 011-886-495-134-718; 012-333-562-833-591; 013-210-533-072-945; 016-220-845-242-163; 018-209-687-890-039; 026-524-247-263-808; 026-735-761-517-671; 027-867-910-497-397; 030-989-751-486-255; 033-622-591-677-498; 034-594-579-129-457; 035-087-499-153-22X; 035-775-229-294-961; 041-616-757-175-973; 043-023-106-534-265; 043-334-181-578-717; 043-354-445-798-712; 043-455-371-359-823; 045-445-063-674-649; 049-091-169-377-597; 049-346-208-924-920; 050-137-130-449-043; 054-328-419-977-493; 054-715-078-148-813; 055-439-916-692-702; 056-064-713-708-207; 057-420-111-160-322; 062-218-780-389-812; 065-357-116-922-518; 066-376-824-715-720; 067-277-473-537-389; 068-452-604-669-157; 072-547-204-496-863; 073-335-262-644-942; 075-182-328-430-399; 075-666-685-673-883; 076-307-235-228-944; 080-348-794-816-190; 089-762-789-750-124; 093-579-516-936-299; 098-312-271-690-700; 099-188-994-062-936; 104-625-941-609-08X; 105-377-085-637-948; 108-617-736-483-655; 113-194-919-014-308; 114-638-686-339-814; 129-559-145-122-865; 146-382-118-408-345; 146-977-228-707-912; 148-510-873-134-137; 154-978-657-665-321; 155-691-175-864-748; 156-547-582-169-232; 166-248-084-772-47X","71","ANDREA HOLZSCHUH; INGOLF STEFFAN-DEWENTER; TEJA TSCHARNTKE","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS : A PUBLICATION OF THE ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS : A PUBLICATION OF THE ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA","","LENS",0,"HOLZSCHUH A, 2009, ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS : A PUBLICATION OF THE ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA","HOLZSCHUH A, 2009, ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS : A PUBLICATION OF THE ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA"

POPULATIONS OF BOTH SPECIES INCREASED MORE FROM SPRING TO AUTUMN IN MORE ISOLATED WOODS. THIS WAS PROBABLY BECAUSE OF REDUCED OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISPERSAL AND THE SHORTAGE OF ALTERNATIVE WOODLAND HABITAT FOR ANIMALS MOVING OFF THE FIELDS AFTER HARVEST. WOODS WELL CONNECTED WITH HEDGES SUPPORTED HIGHER DENSITIES OF BOTH WOOD MICE AND BANK VOLES. 5.

TRANSPORT AND FATE OF DISSOLVED NITROUS OXIDE (N2O) IN GROUNDWATER AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE TO NITROGEN DYNAMICS WITHIN AGRO-ECOSYSTEMS ARE POORLY KNOWN IN SPITE OF SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL OF N2O TO GLOBAL WARMING AND OZONE DEPLETION. INCREASING DENITRIFICATION IN RIPARIAN BUFFERS MAY TRADE A REDUCTION IN NITRATE (NO3−) TRANSPORT TO SURFACE WATERS FOR INCREASED N2O EMISSIONS RESULTING FROM DENITRIFICATION-PRODUCED N2O DISSOLVED IN GROUNDWATER BEING EMITTED INTO THE AIR WHEN GROUNDWATER FLOWS INTO A STREAM OR A RIVER. THIS STUDY QUANTIFIES THE TRANSPORT AND FATE OF NO3− AND DISSOLVED N2O MOVING FROM CROP FIELDS THROUGH RIPARIAN BUFFERS, ASSESSES WHETHER GROUNDWATER EXPORTED FROM CROP FIELDS AND RIPARIAN BUFFERS IS A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF DISSOLVED N2O EMISSIONS, AND EVALUATES THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (IPCC) METHODOLOGY TO ESTIMATE DISSOLVED N2O EMISSION. WE MEASURED CONCENTRATIONS OF NO3−; CHLORIDE (CL−); PH; DISSOLVED N2O, DISSOLVED OXYGEN (DO), AND ORGANIC CARBON (DOC) IN GROUNDWATER UNDER A MULTI-SPECIES RIPARIAN BUFFER, A COOL-SEASON GRASS FILTER, AND ADJACENT CROP FIELDS LOCATED IN THE BEAR CREEK WATERSHED IN CENTRAL IOWA, USA. IN BOTH THE MULTI-SPECIES RIPARIAN BUFFER AND THE COOL-SEASON GRASS FILTER, CONCENTRATIONS OF DISSOLVED N2O IN THE GROUNDWATER DID NOT CHANGE AS IT PASSED THROUGH THE SITES, EVEN WHEN THE CONCENTRATIONS OF GROUNDWATER NO3− WERE DECREASED BY 50% AND 59%, RESPECTIVELY, OVER THE SAME PERIODS. THE FRACTION OF N LOST TO LEACHING AND RUNOFF (0.05) AND THE MODIFIED N2O EMISSION FACTOR, [RATIO OF DISSOLVED N2O FLUX TO N INPUT (0.00002)] DETERMINED FOR THE CROPPED FIELDS INDICATE THAT THE CURRENT IPCC METHODOLOGY OVERESTIMATES DISSOLVED N2O FLUX IN THE SITES. A LOW RATIO BETWEEN DISSOLVED N2O FLUX AND SOIL N2O EMISSION (0.0003) WAS ESTIMATED IN THE CROPPED FIELDS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE RIPARIAN BUFFERS ESTABLISHED ADJACENT TO CROP FIELDS FOR WATER QUALITY FUNCTIONS (ENHANCED DENITRIFICATION) DECREASED NO3− AND WERE NOT A SOURCE OF DISSOLVED N2O. ALSO, THE FLUX OF DISSOLVED N2O FROM THE CROPPED FIELD WAS NEGLIGIBLE IN COMPARISON TO SOIL N2O EMISSION IN THE CROP FIELDS.","6","1","651","685","RIPARIAN ZONE; LEACHING (AGRICULTURE); NITRATE; RIPARIAN BUFFER; WATER QUALITY; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SURFACE RUNOFF; DENITRIFICATION; GROUNDWATER","","","","","https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009BGD.....6..651K/abstract https://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/bgd-2008-0152/ https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/bgd-2008-0152/ https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/6/651/2009/bgd-6-651-2009.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.5194/BGD-6-651-2009","","10.5194/bgd-6-651-2009","1970256697","","0","000-600-406-746-566; 002-465-212-013-00X; 002-937-270-631-538; 005-515-575-341-821; 006-017-352-131-346; 006-114-105-725-512; 007-647-947-577-550; 008-377-081-270-046; 009-076-442-788-383; 015-808-269-554-951; 023-617-712-421-298; 025-154-978-814-00X; 025-644-036-005-817; 027-089-714-082-495; 028-802-252-344-012; 031-641-525-938-443; 036-261-768-137-525; 036-902-840-704-756; 047-804-509-542-726; 062-993-300-408-170; 073-703-019-282-474; 075-015-864-957-620; 075-163-057-989-41X; 075-221-116-412-710; 075-429-883-991-330; 079-196-971-304-319; 082-848-132-695-426; 084-823-042-298-058; 084-919-860-583-172; 085-673-191-155-11X; 088-175-727-127-094; 088-995-521-628-487; 094-220-383-468-828; 096-493-700-003-52X; 103-112-301-998-208; 103-141-730-898-275; 105-027-928-982-484; 106-735-246-652-211; 111-293-161-251-748; 112-714-635-134-623; 113-020-912-348-890; 121-468-243-703-60X; 129-149-313-308-705; 133-007-756-045-351; 133-674-479-125-669; 146-775-070-611-770; 157-539-004-512-082; 158-189-041-348-639; 159-142-227-535-211; 164-321-687-092-049; 166-519-155-744-540; 166-711-528-008-07X; 168-744-837-424-994; 170-939-487-720-479; 176-125-284-590-980; 176-658-844-592-805; 187-367-993-326-489","22","D.

THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1998-2006 AND COVERED FOUR SHELTERBELTS (PLANTED IN 1993-1996) LOCATED IN THE AREA OF THE DEZYDERY CHLAPOWSKI LANDSCAPE PARK (WESTERN PART OF POLAND). THE SHELTERBELTS WERE COLONIZED BY MACROFUNGI JUST AFTER PLANTING. DURING FIRST YEARS OF THEIR GROWTH A TOTAL OF 174 SPECIES WERE RECORDED. SPECIES COMPOSITION CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN INI- TIAL (1998-2000) AND FINAL (2004-2006) PERIOD OF STUDY. SIMILARITY OF MACROFUNGI COMMUNI- TIES (EXPRESSED AS THE SORENSEN'S INDEX) BETWEEN THESE TWO PERIODS IN STUDIED SHELTERBELTS RANGED BETWEEN 37 AND 46%.

FORTY PLANTATIONS, AGED BETWEEN 1 AND 15 YEARS, WERE EXAMINED FOR SOIL NUTRIENTS, GROUND FLORA DEVELOPMENT, TREE SURVIVAL AND NATURAL TREE REGENERATION. PLANTATION SOILS SHOWED AN OVERALL INCREASE IN ACIDITY, TOTAL NITROGEN AND TOTAL ORGANIC CARBON COMPARED WITH ADJACENT FIELDS, BUT THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN TOTAL PHOSPHORUS OR POTASSIUM. TOTAL NITROGEN AND ORGANIC CARBON INCREASED WITH AGE OF PLANTATION. THE OVERALL GROUND FLORA CONSISTED OF 182 SPECIES, BUT MANY OCCURED IN ONLY A FEW PLANTATIONS. THE MAJORITY OF SPECIES WERE COMPETITORS AND RUDERALS. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SPECIES, AND THE NUMBER OF GRASSLAND AND WOODLAND SPECIES, INCREASED WITH PLANTATION AREA. ONLY ARABLE WEED SPECIES NUMBER WAS RELATED TO PLANTATION AGE (NEGATIVELY). CANOPY CLOSURE MARKEDLY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF SPECIES IN PLANTATIONS. THE PRESENCE OF GOOD QUALITY HEDGEROWS ADJACENT TO PLANTATIONS INCREASED THEIR SPECIES RICHNESS, ESPECIALLY OF SHADE-TOLERANT HERBS. PLANTED TREE SURVIVAL IN INDIVIDUAL PLANTATIONS RANGED FROM 32 TO 98% BUT WAS GENERALLY GOOD (MEAN 76%).

THIS STUDY TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE ABSENCE OR PRESENCE OF SHELTER BELTS (ONE OR TWO) IN PADDOCKS DECREASES FENCE-LINE PACING AND ASSOCIATED SOIL AND WATER QUALITY IMPACTS. SOILS NEAR THE FENCE LINE AND IN THE REST OF THE PADDOCK, IN PADDOCKS CONTAINING ZERO, ONE OR TWO SHELTER BELTS, WERE SAMPLED FOR BULK DENSITY AND MACROPOROSITY (PORES > 30 ΜM DIAMETER). LARGE INTACT SAMPLES (1 X 0.2 X 0.1 M 3 ) WERE USED TO GENERATE OVERLAND FLOW VIA RAINFALL SIMULATION. THE FLOW WAS TESTED FOR NUTRIENTS [PHOSPHORUS (P) AND NITROGEN (N) FRACTIONS], SUSPENDED SEDIMENT (SS), AND THE FAECAL INDICATOR BACTERIA, ESCHERICHIA COLI. RESULTS SHOWED THAT BULK DENSITY, VOID VOLUME, SS, PARTICULATE P AND TOTAL P WERE AFFECTED BY LOCATION (FENCE LINE OR REST OF PADDOCK) BUT, ALONG WITH ALL OTHER MEASUREMENTS EXCEPT E. COLI, WERE NOT AFFECTED BY THE NUMBER OF SHELTER BELTS. THUS, THE INCLUSION OF SHELTER HAD NO EFFECT ON THE CONCENTRATION OF CONTAMINANT LOST IN OVERLAND FLOW OR ANY SOIL PHYSICAL OR HYDROLOGICAL PARAMETER, BUT DECREASED THE RUN-OFF OF E. COLI. THE LACK OF CONTRAST BETWEEN THE LOCATION OF SOILS CAN BE PARTLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE SOIL TYPE (BROWN, NZ SOIL CLASSIFICATION, USDA TAXONOMY: TYPIC FRAGIUDALF), WHICH WHEN COMPARED WITH PAST STUDIES WAS LESS EROSIVE AND LOST LESS P INTO SOLUTION. OTHER FACTORS MAY HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT OR THE LESSER IMPACT OF WEANERS COMPARED WITH OLDER HINDS AND STAGS ON SOIL PROPERTIES. ALTHOUGH ONLY E. COLI CONCENTRATIONS WERE DECREASED BY THE INCLUSION OF SHELTER, FACTORS SUCH AS IMPROVED PRODUCTION AND ANIMAL WELFARE WEIGH HEAVILY IN FAVOUR OF INSTALLING AND MAINTAINING SHELTER ON DEER FARMS.

IN THIS FOUR-YEAR FIELD EXPERIMENT, CONDUCTED ON SIX FIELD PARCELS, THE ABILITY OF WILDFLOWER STRIPS TO SIMULTANEOUSLY PROMOTE THE AVAILABILITY OF POLLINATION SERVICES (USING BUMBLEBEE ABUNDANCE AS A PROXY), SPECIES DIVERSITY (TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS OF BUMBLEBEES, BUTTERFLIES AND DIURNAL MOTHS) AND CONSERVATION (ABUNDANCE OF HABITAT SPECIALIST BUTTERFLIES) WAS EVALUATED. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE FIRST TWO INDICATORS INCREASED STRONGLY AND RAPIDLY IN WILDFLOWER STRIPS UNTIL THE THIRD YEAR OF THE EXPERIMENT. THE CONSERVATION INDICATOR INCREASED MORE SLOWLY AND THIS RESPONSE WAS RELATED TO THE FOREST COVER OF THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE. FURTHERMORE, THE BENEFITS OF WILDFLOWER STRIPS WERE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF EXPERIMENTALLY VARIED STRIP PROPERTIES. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT WILDFLOWER STRIPS ARE A FLEXIBLE MITIGATION TOOL TO PROMOTE DIFFERENT BIODIVERSITY TARGETS IN AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS. POLLINATION SERVICES AND SPECIES DIVERSITY CAN BE PROMOTED IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF LANDSCAPES BY ENSURING LOCAL HABITAT QUALITY. IN THE PROMOTION OF HABITAT SPECIALISTS, LANDSCAPE MATRIX QUALITY IS MORE CRITICAL.","179","","18","24","BIODIVERSITY; POLLINATION; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; BUMBLEBEE; WILDFLOWER; SPECIES RICHNESS; AGROFORESTRY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SPECIES DIVERSITY","","","","FINNISH MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY; MAJ AND TOR NESSLING FOUNDATION; EU","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880913002363 https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/publications/can-pollination-services-species-diversity-and-conservation-be-si https://core.ac.uk/display/52248812 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/609440","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.AGEE.2013.07.001","","10.1016/j.agee.2013.07.001","2064164793","","0","004-703-632-577-796; 007-429-738-896-728; 008-225-619-668-580; 009-361-087-991-944; 010-623-745-695-032; 013-029-007-911-298; 015-905-951-111-509; 017-268-881-212-761; 023-890-742-313-519; 024-802-810-540-46X; 025-459-514-490-091; 026-061-345-636-737; 031-862-039-493-29X; 034-503-789-555-538; 044-629-783-838-349; 046-513-869-126-279; 046-907-142-498-727; 048-841-915-674-723; 053-166-160-009-171; 056-323-547-283-971; 058-556-047-140-253; 063-614-772-363-816; 065-687-321-113-981; 068-379-001-737-490; 068-871-937-921-740; 069-559-278-898-558; 071-498-988-090-903; 078-318-665-214-047; 079-068-774-342-74X; 083-042-455-262-135; 083-810-224-480-214; 085-507-496-811-84X; 085-800-668-469-837; 088-723-274-295-38X; 089-535-938-236-007; 090-065-520-860-63X; 095-119-227-316-478; 100-964-811-169-646; 102-366-533-082-155; 108-838-812-821-062; 118-068-275-933-054; 124-319-214-482-940; 131-432-458-569-848; 136-446-153-249-957; 144-915-982-059-308; 145-523-815-049-35X; 146-624-555-178-452; 154-386-144-197-99X; 185-374-982-166-638; 187-902-910-915-854","50","EEVA-LIISA KORPELA; TERHO HYVÖNEN; SAMI LINDGREN; MIKKO KUUSSAARI","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","","LENS",0,"KORPELA EL, 2013, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","KORPELA EL, 2013, AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT"

EIGHT HABITATS WERE STUDIED IN THE FARM: PONDS, DITCHES, A RIPARIAN CORRIDOR, HEDGEROWS, AND FOUR AGRICULTURAL FIELDS (MUSTARD, OATS, FALLOW, AND LEGUMES). THE UNDISTURBED RIPARIAN CORRIDOR HAD HIGHER SOIL $${\TEXT{NO}}_{\TEXT{3}}^ - - {\TEXT{N}}$$;  AND $${\TEXT{NH}}_4^ + - {\TEXT{N}}$$;  CONCENTRATIONS, AND POTENTIALLY MINERALIZABLE N AND HIGHER ABUNDANCES OF BACTERIVORE NEMATODES AND LONGER FOOD WEBS. CANONICAL CORRELATION ANALYSIS SHOWED ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN HABITATS AND NEMATODE TROPHIC GROUPS: PREDATORY AND BACTERIAL-FEEDING NEMATODES IN THE RIPARIAN CORRIDOR AND HEDGEROWS, OMNIVORE NEMATODES IN THE PONDS AND DITCHES, AND FUNGAL-FEEDING NEMATODES IN THE LEGUME FIELD. SOIL CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES MIRRORED THE ABOVEGROUND FARM PATTERNS AND WERE MORE SIMILAR AMONG HABITATS THAT WERE OR HAD BEEN CULTIVATED, COMPARED TO THE RIPARIAN CORRIDOR. SOIL FOOD WEB INDICES, BASED ON FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF NEMATODE FAUNAL COMPOSITION, REFLECTED THE ABOVEGROUND LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY. DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT SOIL FOOD WEB INDICES SEPARATED THE TWO MOST DISTURBED HABITATS (PONDS AND TAILWATER DITCHES) FROM THE TWO LEAST DISTURBED HABITATS (THE RIPARIAN CORRIDOR AND HEDGEROWS). THE INDICES CORRELATED WITH SOIL FUNCTIONING AS INFERRED BY SOIL PROPERTIES. ABUNDANCE OF NEMATODE TAXA WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ABOVEGROUND LANDSCAPE PATTERNS. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SOIL FOOD WEB MAY HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY (1) ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT DIFFERED BETWEEN YEARS, (2) DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS SINCE DISTURBANCE IN THE VARIOUS HABITATS, AND (3) MOVEMENT OF NUTRIENTS AND ORGANISMS BY WATER FLOW BETWEEN HABITATS IN THE FARMSCALE.","44","5","727","744","FOOD WEB; RIPARIAN ZONE; ORGANIC FARMING; BIODIVERSITY; HABITAT; ECOLOGY; WATER FLOW; SOIL FOOD WEB; AGRONOMY; TROPHIC LEVEL; BIOLOGY","","","","","https://ucanr.edu/sites/Jackson_Lab/files/113600.pdf https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00374-007-0256-0.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00374-007-0256-0","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1007/S00374-007-0256-0","","10.1007/s00374-007-0256-0","2055231994","","0","000-689-702-074-331; 003-907-525-480-153; 004-167-559-659-819; 004-492-015-427-63X; 004-635-157-368-378; 006-807-920-329-120; 007-541-372-936-050; 009-436-348-069-514; 009-508-051-127-330; 010-423-042-177-734; 013-291-095-460-522; 015-511-375-964-914; 016-459-795-797-842; 017-506-139-680-393; 017-555-940-460-67X; 026-745-298-292-35X; 027-994-526-345-075; 030-742-593-017-992; 030-978-497-436-303; 031-357-096-031-895; 031-516-924-806-664; 032-807-208-218-884; 035-519-172-134-12X; 037-655-209-344-331; 042-714-677-464-308; 044-338-882-212-755; 044-849-348-883-406; 044-914-564-605-687; 048-051-535-661-406; 050-357-955-949-469; 053-295-226-109-871; 057-720-330-037-206; 058-741-260-042-526; 065-755-128-983-805; 065-819-125-643-354; 067-412-268-380-895; 068-567-042-775-977; 077-899-911-729-09X; 081-640-666-093-914; 084-406-478-777-589; 089-574-681-563-601; 096-960-066-363-762; 097-779-488-783-943; 099-476-479-226-55X; 100-693-323-671-723; 101-934-986-069-937; 104-402-912-397-497; 104-993-739-215-561; 106-444-334-231-337; 109-558-923-762-907; 113-070-276-598-586; 116-049-798-691-473; 118-136-058-560-88X; 120-055-510-842-160; 125-952-059-804-814; 130-428-793-212-186; 138-075-475-467-298; 141-506-598-390-294; 144-039-355-460-541; 162-991-788-256-196; 195-300-106-988-149; 196-937-470-206-70X","42","SARA SÁNCHEZ-MORENO; SEAN SMUKLER; HOWARD FERRIS; ANTHONY T.

HERE, WE INVESTIGATED PLANT–GRASSHOPPER INTERACTIONS IN SOWN MARGIN STRIPS AND THE RESPECTIVE EFFECTS OF PLANT IDENTITY AND DIVERSITY ON GRASSHOPPERS. WE SURVEYED PLANTS AND GRASSHOPPERS IN 44 SOWN MARGIN STRIPS LOCATED IN WESTERN FRANCE WHICH WERE INITIALLY ESTABLISHED WITH THREE SOWING MIXTURES DOMINATED, RESPECTIVELY, BY ALFALFA, FESTUCA RUBRA AND LOLIUM PERENNE AND FESTUCA ARUNDINACEA. GRASSHOPPER SPECIES CONTRASTED IN THEIR RESPONSE TO PLANT DIVERSITY AND TO THE ABUNDANCE OF SOWN AND NON-SOWN PLANT SPECIES. SOME GRASSHOPPER SPECIES WERE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE ABUNDANCE OF GRASS AND ESPECIALLY OF A SINGLE SOWN PLANT SPECIES, F. RUBRA. IN CONTRAST, OTHER GRASSHOPPER SPECIES BENEFITED FROM HIGH PLANT DIVERSITY LIKELY DUE TO THEIR HIGH DEGREE OF POLYPHAGY. AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL, THESE CONTRASTED RESPONSES WERE TRANSLATED INTO A POSITIVE LINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GRASS COVER AND GRASSHOPPER ABUNDANCE AND INTO A QUADRATIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PLANT DIVERSITY AND GRASSHOPPER DIVERSITY OR ABUNDANCE.

MOREOVER, DIFFERENT WAYS OF MITIGATING THE LOSSES IN A BOREAL CLIMATE ARE DISCUSSED. STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED IN 1996-2008 AT JOKIOINEN, TOHMAJARVI, RUUKKI AND TAIVALKOSKI.; ; WATER SAMPLES REPRESENTING SURFACE RUNOFF WERE COLLECTED FROM OPEN DITCHES AND ANALYSED E.G. FOR TOTAL SOLIDS (SEDIMENT) AS WELL AS TOTAL P (TP), DISSOLVED REACTIVE P (DRP) AND TOTAL N (TN) TO ESTIMATE NUTRIENT LOSSES FROM FORESTED FEEDLOTS WITH DIFFERENT STOCKING RATES (ANIMAL UNITS PER HECTARE, AU/HA) AND FROM SLURRY-AMENDED GRASS. SURFACE RUNOFF SAMPLES WERE SIMILARLY ANALYSED TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF 10 M WIDE BUFFER ZONES TO DECREASE AND RETAIN NUTRIENT LOSSES FROM PASTURE AND TILLED SOIL. THE SOIL WAS SAMPLED FOR PLANT-AVAILABLE P AND MINERAL NITROGEN (SMN) ANALYSES.; ; FAIRLY HIGH TP (0,9-1,4 KG/HA/YR) AND TN (4-16 KG/HA/YR) LOSSES OCCURRED IN DITCH WATER FROM FORESTED FEEDLOTS WHERE CATTLE HAS BEEN REARED FOR 1-3 YEARS. THESE AMOUNTS CORRESPOND TO THE ANNUAL LOSSES FROM CROPPED FELDS. THE PLANT-AVAILABLE P (UP TO 20 MG/L) IN SURFACE SOIL AND THE AMOUNT OF SMN (UP TO 100-400 KG/HA) IN THE 60 CM DEEP SOIL LAYER WERE HIGHEST IN PLACES WHERE THE CATTLE GATHERED, SUCH AS BEDDED AND FEEDING AREAS (CALLED HIGH-INPUT AREAS).; ; HIGH LOSSES OF TP AND DRP (4,4 AND 3,6 KG/HA/YR, RESPECTIVELY) ALSO OCCURED IN SURFACE RUNOFF FROM THE GRASS FIELDS WHERE SURFACE APPLICATION OF SLURRY (40 T/HA) IN AUTUMN WAS FOLLOWED BY RAINFALL. INJECTION OF THE SLURRY INTO THE SOIL DECREASED TP AND DRP LOSSES BY 79 AND 86 %, RESPECTIVELY.; ; THE BUFFER ZONES ALONG WATERCOURSES WERE LESS IMPORTANT IN THE GRAZED FIELD THAN IN AUTUMN-TILLED SOIL DUE TO THE SMALLER EROSION AND NUTRIENT LOSSES FROM GRASS THAN FROM TILLED SOIL. THE SURFACE RUNOFF LOSSES OF SEDIMENT, TP AND TN DECREASED BY MORE THAN 50, 30 AND 50 %, RESPECTIVELY, BY BUFFER ZONES ON TILLED SOIL.","","","","","EROSION; TOTAL DISSOLVED SOLIDS; NUTRIENT; PASTURE; DITCH; SEDIMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SURFACE RUNOFF; PHOSPHORUS; AGRONOMY","","","","","http://orgprints.org/16813/1/mtttiede7.pdf https://jukuri.luke.fi/handle/10024/438316 http://www.mtt.fi/mtttiede/pdf/mtttiede7.pdf https://orgprints.org/id/eprint/16813/","HTTPS://JUKURI.LUKE.FI/HANDLE/10024/438316","","","26388856","","0","000-320-672-752-794; 000-714-376-181-669; 005-039-941-602-805; 005-155-501-929-87X; 007-241-106-224-54X; 008-948-130-979-390; 009-169-915-488-894; 009-248-758-733-184; 009-806-097-947-292; 011-288-274-938-632; 012-704-803-641-276; 013-425-576-776-57X; 014-251-633-857-00X; 014-561-967-561-763; 015-215-491-508-16X; 017-271-112-600-695; 018-212-847-539-780; 018-668-638-487-019; 018-890-906-176-709; 024-179-289-996-527; 028-025-519-103-100; 030-682-084-703-597; 031-784-027-504-755; 032-352-602-848-253; 034-139-180-623-07X; 034-748-846-517-673; 035-607-343-413-589; 036-889-236-746-729; 038-659-320-814-260; 039-129-331-213-450; 040-470-082-538-290; 043-839-290-390-354; 049-899-708-907-289; 055-494-363-954-590; 058-092-669-418-747; 063-868-086-799-556; 066-160-305-182-384; 069-915-446-537-208; 070-790-840-870-745; 072-307-357-826-584; 074-156-419-052-56X; 076-826-572-086-275; 077-418-118-294-000; 079-264-187-787-54X; 079-537-139-295-920; 082-797-391-654-568; 086-304-856-594-276; 088-236-621-248-724; 089-511-057-268-117; 090-479-400-395-403; 091-602-863-179-667; 102-307-069-255-349; 102-381-504-494-463; 103-750-378-883-448; 104-538-356-167-561; 110-028-002-619-628; 111-229-567-477-96X; 112-062-796-589-388; 112-840-321-256-22X; 114-691-978-054-143; 116-435-053-348-131; 123-999-809-449-467; 128-195-997-346-382; 134-388-309-968-363; 136-078-117-326-445; 138-453-206-836-337; 139-686-152-452-357; 141-241-435-513-682; 141-828-395-465-227; 146-176-027-911-992; 146-325-237-721-229; 147-749-992-097-760; 148-032-072-732-15X; 148-447-693-552-594; 148-468-520-956-729; 153-882-585-520-437; 155-077-672-111-552; 156-559-662-768-946; 157-378-714-184-189; 165-740-369-689-328; 165-894-637-048-634; 167-013-613-510-038; 175-076-714-727-867; 175-427-840-393-978; 176-737-333-058-307; 180-961-259-537-959; 181-236-947-340-767; 183-493-993-121-67X; 187-118-162-708-884; 195-389-162-764-127; 196-199-326-289-983; 198-140-893-377-564; 198-893-447-208-716","3","JAANA UUSI-KÄMPPÄ","","","","LENS",0,"UUSI-KÄMPPÄ J, 2010, ","UUSI-KÄMPPÄ J, 2010, "

WE PRESENT TWO ORCHARD EXPERIMENTS WHERE THE DENSITIES OF THE ASIAN CITRUS PSYLLID (DIAPHORINA CITRI) WERE COMPARED DEPENDING ON: (1) THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF A WINDBREAK AND (2) IF THE ORCHARDS CONSISTED OF A SOLID SET RE-PLANTING OR AN ORCHARD WITH A MIXTURE OF MATURE AND RESET-REPLACEMENT TREES. PSYLLID ABUNDANCE WAS MEASURED ON THE EDGES OF FIVE ORCHARDS. THE FACTOR INVESTIGATED WAS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF A WINDBREAK. WE OBSERVED SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER PSYLLIDS ON THE EDGES OF ORCHARDS WITH WINDBREAKS AS COMPARED TO THOSE WITHOUT WINDBREAKS. WE FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF NATURAL ENEMIES BETWEEN THE EDGES WITH OR WITHOUT WINDBREAKS, SUGGESTING THAT WINDBREAKS DO NOT AFFECT DENSITIES OF PSYLLID NATURAL ENEMIES. ALSO, DURING TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS, WE COMPARED THE DENSITIES OF PSYLLIDS ON YOUNG TREES LESS THAN 3 YEARS OF AGE IN A SOLID SET RE-PLANTING VERSUS ON RESETS (TREES PLANTED IN REPLACEMENT OF DEAD OR HUANGLONGBING-INFECTED TREES) PRESENT RANDOMLY WITHIN MATURE ORCHARDS. THIS WAS CONDUCTED IN FOUR ORCHARDS AND AMONG THREE CITRUS VARIETIES. MORE PSYLLIDS WERE FOUND IN THE SOLID SET RE-PLANTINGS AS COMPARED WITH ON THE RESETS WITHIN MATURE ORCHARDS. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST REPORT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PLANTING STRATEGY OF NEW TREES IN ORCHARDS MAY IMPACT THE POPULATIONS OF A HORTICULTURAL PEST. OVERALL OUR DATA SUGGEST THAT ESTABLISHMENT AND CONSERVATION OF WINDBREAKS MIGHT BE BENEFICIAL TO PROTECT ORCHARDS FROM D. CITRI. THE DATA ALSO SUGGEST THAT D.

THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEME MANAGEMENT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE NATIONAL-SCALE EFFECTS ON AVIAN POPULATION GROWTH RATES, ALTHOUGH OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SOME COMPONENTS OF THE SCHEME HAVE HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON BIRD POPULATIONS. THEREFORE, WHILST THIS STUDY PROVIDES THE FIRST PROOF-OF-CONCEPT FOR BROAD-AND-SHALLOW SCHEME IMPACTS ON BIODIVERSITY, OUR RESULTS UNDERLINE THE IMPORTANCE OF TARGETING TOWARDS POPULATION-LIMITING FACTORS, HERE WINTER FOOD RESOURCES. A COMBINATION OF LOW UPTAKE OF KEY IN-FIELD OPTIONS THAT PROVIDE WINTER SEED AND A FAILURE TO COVER THE LATE-WINTER PERIOD EFFECTIVELY EXPLAINS THE LACK OF NATIONAL POPULATION RESPONSES. SUCH ISSUES NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE SCHEMES LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP WILL ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS. THIS STUDY SHOWS THE VALUE OF FEEDBACK FROM MONITORING FOR INFORMING SCHEME DESIGN, THROUGH IDENTIFYING PROBLEMS AND TESTING SOLUTIONS.","49","4","871","882","ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; LAND USE, LAND-USE CHANGE AND FORESTRY; BIODIVERSITY; GEOGRAPHY; BREEDING BIRD SURVEY; AGRICULTURAL POLICY; CONTEXT (LANGUAGE USE); ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP; POPULATION; POPULATION GROWTH","","","","","https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/landscape-scale-responses-of-birds-to-agri-environment-management https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02161.x https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND44763547 https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02161.x https://core.ac.uk/display/9697057 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02161.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02161.x/abstract https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02161.x%4010.1111/%28ISSN%291365-2664.AGRO_ECOLOGY https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02161.x https://core.ac.uk/download/9697057.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1365-2664.2012.02161.X","","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02161.x","1856883107","","0","002-262-285-007-84X; 007-194-033-627-161; 010-015-870-849-695; 016-421-756-148-512; 021-419-559-384-303; 036-117-863-979-556; 041-304-068-012-631; 042-082-544-198-293; 043-009-269-441-396; 043-583-117-779-984; 051-685-596-945-405; 055-946-607-021-418; 056-099-523-856-735; 057-720-592-467-337; 057-941-074-733-032; 063-149-977-873-288; 064-643-064-473-458; 068-933-205-872-606; 074-225-773-604-407; 075-491-486-540-39X; 076-278-055-254-459; 085-737-772-585-724; 093-313-315-515-73X; 095-859-455-727-31X; 096-101-436-780-075; 103-573-046-017-776; 111-555-145-816-70X; 124-319-214-482-940; 137-723-310-088-608; 173-341-907-639-996","112","DAVID BAKER; STEPHEN N.

IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE DEVELOPED MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO ENHANCE THE FLORISTIC AND STRUCTURAL DIVERSITY OF THESE EXISTING STRIPS FOR THE BENEFIT OF SPIDERS, A KEY PROVIDER OF NATURAL PEST CONTROL IN CROPS.; ; ; ACROSS THREE UK ARABLE FARMS, WE INVESTIGATED THE BENEFITS OF: (I) SCARIFICATION TO CREATE GERMINATION NICHES INTO WHICH WILDFLOWER SEEDS WERE SOWN AND (II) THE EFFECT OF GRAMINICIDE APPLICATIONS TO SUPPRESS GRASS DOMINANCE. SPIDERS WERE SAMPLED TWICE PER YEAR (JULY AND SEPTEMBER) DURING 2008 AND 2009.; ; ; THE COMBINATION OF SCARIFICATION WITH WILDFLOWER SEEDS, AS WELL AS GRAMINICIDE, RESULTED IN THE GREATEST WILDFLOWER COVER AND LOWEST GRASS COVER, WITH A GENERAL TREND OF INCREASED ABUNDANCE OF ADULT AND JUVENILE SPIDERS. THE ABUNDANCE OF PACHYGNATHA DEGEERI, BATHYPHANTES GRACILIS AND JUVENILE WOLF SPIDERS OF THE GENUS PARDOSA WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH WILDFLOWER COVER, PROBABLY REFLECTING INCREASED PREY AVAILABILITY. SWARD STRUCTURE WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH ERIGONE ATRA, OEDOTHORAX FUSCUS AND JUVENILE PARDOSA ABUNDANCE.; ; ; MANAGEMENT THAT UTILIZES EXISTING COMMONLY ADOPTED AGRI-ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS, SUCH AS GRASS BUFFER STRIPS, REPRESENTS A POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT CONSERVATION TOOL FOR INCREASING THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF INVERTEBRATE HABITATS. THIS CAN MAXIMIZE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PROVISION OF MULTIPLE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, INCLUDING PEST REGULATION BY PREDATORS SUCH AS SPIDERS. THESE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE INCORPORATED INTO EXISTING U.K. AND EUROPEAN AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES.","15","1","77","85","BIODIVERSITY; HABITAT; PREDATION; ECOLOGY; WILDFLOWER; PARDOSA; BUFFER STRIP; PEST CONTROL; AGRONOMY; ARABLE LAND; BIOLOGY","","","","","http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/31514/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1461-9563.2012.00593.x https://eprints.worc.ac.uk/2295/","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1461-9563.2012.00593.X","","10.1111/j.1461-9563.2012.00593.x","2045575037","","0","001-296-166-754-358; 002-133-948-308-90X; 007-827-850-871-938; 008-225-619-668-580; 010-171-254-110-63X; 010-302-492-561-636; 012-357-805-545-268; 025-327-461-520-458; 029-904-475-177-008; 030-015-663-260-664; 030-453-266-652-445; 033-543-257-728-557; 037-325-128-567-400; 042-765-344-128-744; 046-513-869-126-279; 047-928-935-382-520; 054-585-052-877-054; 055-962-856-109-250; 056-391-120-745-502; 056-585-869-238-25X; 057-186-934-575-091; 060-303-879-790-212; 063-737-331-566-677; 064-406-747-850-970; 069-870-646-185-730; 070-360-118-413-221; 070-592-258-198-829; 070-703-492-655-943; 071-245-262-326-969; 071-363-274-178-219; 072-897-670-421-690; 073-359-404-037-66X; 074-793-529-288-006; 080-139-567-968-521; 080-164-660-083-693; 082-226-182-630-392; 090-479-535-234-324; 100-038-531-979-078; 100-964-811-169-646; 109-949-301-670-192; 126-563-773-839-771; 133-048-738-071-733; 133-215-158-664-466; 135-233-059-071-616; 149-200-651-727-319; 153-368-929-556-854; 166-193-746-968-362; 179-048-991-295-983; 187-603-367-498-373; 187-902-910-915-854","12","ROBIN J.

THE QUESTION OF HOW THE LANDSCAPE CONTEXT OF THESE PLANTINGS INFLUENCES THEIR USE HAS NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY RESEARCHED. WE USED MULTIPLE REGRESSION AND AKAIKE'S INFORMATION CRITERIA TO DETERMINE HOW HABITAT WIDTH AND SEVERAL LANDSCAPE-LEVEL FACTORS (I.E., LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION [TOTAL HERBACEOUS COVER, AMOUNT OF DEVELOPED AREA, AND AMOUNT OF WOODED COVER] AND CONFIGURATION [HERBACEOUS EDGE DENSITY]) INFLUENCED THE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF THE BUTTERFLY COMMUNITY USING FILTER STRIPS IN SOUTHWESTERN MINNESOTA, USA. HABITAT-SENSITIVE BUTTERFLY ABUNDANCE AND ALL RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY MEASURES WERE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH FILTER-STRIP WIDTH.

TREATMENTS WERE ROW CROP (RC), GRASS BUFFER (GB), AGROFORESTRY BUFFER (AG), AND GRASS WATERWAYS (GWW). A CORN (ZEA MAYS L.)– SOYBEAN (GLYCINE MAX L.) ROTATION UNDER NO-TILL MANAGEMENT WAS ESTABLISHED IN A WATERSHED IN NORTHEAST MISSOURI IN 1991; GRASS BUFFERS WERE IMPLEMENTED IN 1997. GRASS BUFFERS, 4.5 M WIDE AND 36.5 M APART, CONSISTED OF A MIXTURE OF REDTOP (AGROSTIS GIGANTEA ROTH), BROME GRASS (BROMUS SPP.), AND BIRDSFOOT TREFOIL (LOTUS CORNICULATUS L.) ON CONTOUR WITHIN THE WATERSHED. AGROFORESTRY BUFFERS HAVE PIN OAK (QUERCUS PALUSTRIS MUENCHH.) TREES DISTRIBUTED DOWN THE CENTER OF THE GRASS BUFFERS ON ONE HALF OF THE WATERSHED.

SOIL ENZYMES STUDIED INCLUDE: FLUORESCEIN DIACETATE HYDROLASE, B-GLUCOSIDASE, GLUCOSAMINIDASE, AND DEHYDROGENASE. SOIL DNA CONTENT WAS DETERMINED AS AN ALTERNATIVE FOR MICROBIAL BIOMASS. WSA WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AMONG TREATMENTS AND LANDSCAPE POSITIONS. WSA DECREASED FROM GWW > AG > GB > RC MANAGEMENT TREATMENTS AND ALSO DECREASED FROM LOWER > MIDDLE > SUMMIT LANDSCAPE POSITIONS. SOIL CARBON AND NITROGEN WERE HIGHEST FOR THE GWW TREATMENT AND LOWEST FOR RC. THE LANDSCAPE POSITION EFFECT WAS SIGNIFICANT FOR RC AND AG TREATMENTS. FLUORESCEIN DIACETATE, B-GLUCOSIDASE AND GLUCOSAMINIDASE ENZYME ACTIVITIES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN BUFFERS AND GWW AREAS THAN RC AREAS. DEHYDROGENASE ACTIVITY WAS DIFFERENT BETWEEN GRASS (GB AND GWW) AND CROP AREAS. THE LANDSCAPE EFFECT WAS INSIGNIFICANT FOR ENZYME ACTIVITY. ALTHOUGH SOIL DNA MAY BE A GOOD INDICATOR OF MICROBIAL BIOMASS, IT DID NOT APPEAR TO DIFFERENTIATE AMONG MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AS SELECTIVELY AS OTHER MICROBIAL PARAMETERS.

RECONVERSION OF ANNUAL AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS TO PERENNIAL VEGETATION CAN LEAD TO HYDROLOGIC FUNCTION RESTORATION, BUT ITS EFFECT IS STILL NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. THEREFORE, OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF STRATEGIC INTRODUCTION OF DIFFERENT AMOUNTS AND LOCATION OF NATIVE PRAIRIE VEGETATION (NPV) WITHIN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES ON HYDROLOGICAL REGULATION. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN IOWA (USA), AND CONSISTED OF A FULLY BALANCED, REPLICATED, INCOMPLETE BLOCK DESIGN WHEREBY 12 ZERO-ORDER EPHEMERAL FLOW WATERSHEDS RECEIVED FOUR TREATMENTS CONSISTING OF VARYING PROPORTIONS (0%, 10%, AND 20%) OF PRAIRIE VEGETATION LOCATED IN DIFFERENT WATERSHED POSITIONS (FOOTSLOPE VS. CONTOUR STRIPS). RUNOFF VOLUME AND RATE WERE MEASURED FROM 2008 TO 2010 (APRIL– OCTOBER) WITH AN H-FLUME INSTALLED IN EACH CATCHMENT, AND AUTOMATED ISCO SAMPLERS. OVER THE ENTIRE STUDY PERIOD, WE OBSERVED A TOTAL OF 129 RUNOFF EVENTS WITH AN AVERAGE RUNOFF VOLUME REDUCTION OF 37% BASED ON THE THREE TREATMENTS WITH NPV COMPARED TO WATERSHEDS WITH ROW CROPS. WE OBSERVED A PROGRESSIVELY GREATER REDUCTION ACROSS THE 3 YEARS OF THE STUDY AS THE PERENNIAL STRIPS BECAME ESTABLISHED WITH THE GREATEST DIFFERENCES AMONG TREATMENTS OCCURRING IN 2010. THE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE WATERSHEDS WERE ATTRIBUTED MAINLY TO NPV AMOUNT AND POSITION, WITH THE 10% NPV AT FOOTSLOPE TREATMENT HAVING THE GREATEST RUNOFF REDUCTION PROBABLY BECAUSE THE PORTION OF NPV FILTER STRIP THAT ACTUALLY CONTACTED WATERSHED RUNOFF WAS GREATER WITH THE 10% NPV AT FOOTSLOPE. WE OBSERVED GREATER REDUCTIONS IN RUNOFF IN SPRING AND FALL LIKELY BECAUSE PERENNIAL PRAIRIE PLANTS WERE ACTIVE AND CROPS WERE ABSENT OR NOT FULLY ESTABLISHED. HIGH ANTECEDENT SOIL MOISTURE SOMETIMES LED TO LITTLE BENEFIT OF THE NPV TREATMENTS BUT IN GENERAL THE NPV TREATMENTS WERE EFFECTIVE DURING BOTH SMALL AND LARGE EVENTS. WE CONCLUDE THAT, SMALL AMOUNTS OF NPV STRATEGICALLY INCORPORATED INTO CORN-SOYBEAN WATERSHEDS IN THE MIDWEST US CAN BE USED TO EFFECTIVELY REDUCE RUNOFF.","477","","94","103","CROP YIELD; DRAINAGE BASIN; WATERSHED; VEGETATION; PERENNIAL PLANT; ROW CROP; FILTER STRIP; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SURFACE RUNOFF","","","","","https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1721&context=abe_eng_pubs https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/64970 https://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/47020 https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/47020 https://core.ac.uk/display/36091653 https://www.fs.fed.us/nrs/pubs/jrnl/2013/nrs_2013_Hernandez-Santana_001.pdf https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/abe_eng_pubs/439/ https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013JHyd..477...94H/abstract https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169412009651 https://works.bepress.com/matthew_helmers/83/ https://www.srs.fs.fed.us/pubs/47020 https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/64970/4/Native%20prairie%20filter%20strips%20reduce%20runoff.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/38932890.pdf","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2012.11.013","","10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.11.013","2088105808","","0","000-073-950-100-003; 000-933-635-218-121; 001-869-147-068-585; 002-430-400-638-330; 003-148-094-786-550; 011-962-153-122-815; 012-938-497-872-958; 014-399-584-926-718; 015-404-476-750-989; 019-057-578-554-139; 023-586-411-051-925; 023-818-646-869-756; 024-043-475-626-80X; 025-318-180-360-625; 030-682-084-703-597; 031-302-854-486-488; 034-438-015-172-199; 036-466-585-417-013; 037-537-684-516-668; 038-335-400-539-341; 038-439-180-047-201; 041-606-538-207-737; 042-198-513-831-839; 043-332-678-682-211; 045-412-428-948-577; 045-701-492-592-932; 046-858-036-681-925; 048-126-632-159-980; 048-614-212-390-003; 049-091-169-377-597; 049-773-598-549-535; 057-131-240-501-938; 057-609-524-984-96X; 059-381-194-377-394; 068-406-373-724-27X; 068-997-932-046-194; 071-167-876-727-598; 072-785-749-710-843; 083-149-726-254-365; 083-332-471-417-251; 083-721-851-012-941; 087-680-309-241-290; 088-017-310-971-747; 101-436-533-216-728; 102-299-231-485-20X; 111-323-654-584-502; 113-419-259-532-621; 113-604-919-002-664; 117-534-511-709-388; 121-295-397-898-486; 123-324-136-415-020; 124-154-903-062-906; 127-134-284-709-23X; 128-044-932-510-171; 133-138-314-955-26X; 137-450-452-693-60X; 145-203-559-729-096; 145-772-776-735-820; 146-715-505-404-216; 149-367-063-545-839; 164-811-124-878-023; 166-206-159-722-288; 168-424-180-911-647; 172-475-658-011-870; 176-181-840-447-605; 177-201-206-528-32X; 179-775-405-073-482; 186-314-059-853-436; 187-103-148-209-42X; 197-403-936-641-667; 198-427-699-712-670","55","VIRGINIA HERNANDEZ-SANTANA; XIAOBO ZHOU; MATTHEW J.

THE MOST COMMON SPECIES IN ORCHARDS WERE: OMALIUM CAESUM, DEXIOGYIA CORTICINA, MOCYTA ORBATA, COPROCHARA BIPUSTULATA, SPHENOMA ABDOMINALE, DRUSILLA CANALICULATA, STYLOXYS INSECATUS, PALPORUS NITIDULUS, HETEROTHOPS DISSIMILIS, MOCYTA FUNGI, PELLA LIMBATA, PYCNOTA VICINA AND HEMITROPIA SORDIDA.THE NUMBER OF SPECIES WAS HIGH IN CONTROL PLOTS WITHOUT ANY INSECTICIDE APPLICATION AND LESS IN INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT PLOTS, WHERE SELECTIVE INSECTICIDES WERE USED. IN THE WHEAT FIELDS A TOTAL OF 798 INDIVIDUALS BELONGING TO 20 SPECIES WERE COLLECTED. THE MOST WIDELY OCCURRING SPECIES WERE: STAPHYLINUS CAESAREUS, TACHYPORUS HYPNORUM, PHILONTHUS COGNATUS, ALOCONOTA GREGARIA, TACHYPORUS CHRYSOMELINUS AND T. OBTUSUS. ALTHOUGH SPECIES FROM TACHYPORUS SPP. WERE DOMINANT IN CUMULATIVE SAMPLES, THE ACTIVITY DENSITY DECREASED CONSIDERABLY FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE VEGETATION PERIOD. THE FIELDS' STRUCTURE AND THE TREATMENTS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN FORMING THE DOMINANCE OF SPECIES. ALSO THE DYNAMICS OF EACH SPECIES IS HIGHLY INFLUENCED BY THE DISTURBANCES. THESE COULD BE EXPLAINED WITH DIFFERENT MICROCLIMATIC AND HUMIDITY TOLERANCE OF THE SPECIES. THE GREATER MOBILITY OF STAPHYLINIDS MAY ENABLE THEM TO AVOID PESTICIDE TREATMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL FIELDS. THESE FACTORS (NATURAL WEED COWER, THE PRESENCE OF THE HEDGEROWS AND THE FLYING ABILITY OF THE SPECIES) CAN INTERACT AND OFFER OPTIMAL POSSIBILITIES FOR PREDATION IN AGRICULTURAL FIELDS.","","","","","INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT; PESTICIDE; DOMINANCE (ECOLOGY); PREDATION; ECOLOGY; WEED; PHILONTHUS COGNATUS; TACHYPORUS; COMMON SPECIES; BIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","2133429362","","0","017-328-150-792-979; 021-567-740-197-216; 038-950-105-220-885; 045-347-571-315-037; 052-413-535-546-352; 056-162-613-440-505; 089-015-994-801-809; 107-218-380-077-79X; 108-348-943-905-985; 153-195-377-079-785","9","ADALBERT BALOG; VIKTOR MARKÓ","","","","LENS",0,"BALOG A, 2007, ","BALOG A, 2007, "

DENITRIFICATION WITHIN RIPARIAN BUFFERS MAY TRADE REDUCED NONPOINT SOURCE POLLUTION OF SURFACE WATERS FOR INCREASED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS RESULTING FROM DENITRIFICATION-PRODUCED NITROUS OXIDE (N2O). HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE N2O EMISSION WITHIN CONSERVATION BUFFERS ESTABLISHED FOR WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT OR OF THE IMPORTANCE OF SHORT-TERM N2O PEAK EMISSION FOLLOWING REWETTING DRY SOILS AND THAWING FROZEN SOILS. SUCH ESTIMATES ARE IMPORTANT IN REDUCING UNCERTAINTIES IN CURRENT INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (IPCC) METHODOLOGIES ESTIMATING SOIL N2O EMISSION WHICH ARE BASED ON N INPUTS. THIS STUDY CONTRASTS N2O EMISSION FROM RIPARIAN BUFFER SYSTEMS OF THREE PERENNIAL VEGETATION TYPES AND AN ADJACENT CROP FIELD, AND COMPARES MEASURED N2O EMISSION WITH ESTIMATES BASED ON THE IPCC METHODOLOGY. WE MEASURED SOIL PROPERTIES, N INPUTS, WEATHER CONDITIONS AND N2O FLUXES FROM SOILS IN FORESTED RIPARIAN BUFFERS, WARM-SEASON AND COOL-SEASON GRASS FILTERS, AND A CROP FIELD LOCATED IN THE BEAR CREEK WATERSHED IN CENTRAL IOWA, USA. CUMULATIVE N2O EMISSIONS FROM SOILS IN ALL RIPARIAN BUFFERS (5.8 KG N2O-N HA−1 IN 2006–2007) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THOSE FROM CROP FIELD SOILS (24.0 KG N2O-N HA−1 IN 2006–2007), WITH NO DIFFERENCE AMONG THE BUFFER VEGETATION TYPES. WHILE N2O PEAK EMISSIONS (UP TO 70-FOLD INCREASE) FOLLOWING THE REWETTING OF DRY SOILS AND THAWING OF FROZEN SOILS COMPRISED 46–70% OF THE ANNUAL N2O EMISSIONS FROM SOILS IN THE CROP FIELD, SOILS IN THE RIPARIAN BUFFERS WERE LESS SENSITIVE TO SUCH EVENTS (3 TO 10-FOLD INCREASE). THE RATIO OF N2O EMISSION TO N INPUTS WITHIN RIPARIAN BUFFERS (0.02) WAS SMALLER THAN THOSE OF CROP FIELD (0.07). THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT N2O EMISSION FROM SOILS WITHIN THE RIPARIAN BUFFERS ESTABLISHED FOR WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A MAJOR SOURCE OF N2O EMISSION COMPARED TO CROP FIELD EMISSION. THE OBSERVED LARGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEASURED N2O EMISSIONS AND THOSE ESTIMATED USING THE IPCC'S RECOMMENDED METHODOLOGY (I.E., 87% UNDERESTIMATION) IN THE CROP FIELD SUGGESTS THAT THE IPCC METHODOLOGY MAY UNDERESTIMATE N2O EMISSION IN THE REGIONS WHERE SOIL REWETTING AND THAWING ARE COMMON, AND THAT CONDITIONS PREDICTED BY FUTURE CLIMATE-CHANGE SCENARIOS MAY INCREASE N2O EMISSIONS.","6","1","607","650","RIPARIAN ZONE; RIPARIAN FOREST; SOIL WATER; NONPOINT SOURCE POLLUTION; RIPARIAN BUFFER; WATER QUALITY; HYDROLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; GREENHOUSE GAS; DENITRIFICATION","","","","","http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1218&context=eeob_ag_pubs https://works.bepress.com/thomas_isenhart/58/ https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/6/607/2009/bgd-6-607-2009.pdf https://works.bepress.com/jim_raich/22/download/ https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009BGD.....6..607K/abstract https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/bgd-2008-0147/ https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/eeob_ag_pubs/219/","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.5194/BGD-6-607-2009","","10.5194/bgd-6-607-2009","2064091118","","0","000-439-957-255-861; 000-542-848-030-810; 000-933-635-218-121; 002-199-299-750-774; 002-366-294-773-665; 002-937-270-631-538; 005-515-575-341-821; 007-240-071-601-549; 009-379-307-440-518; 009-895-283-404-897; 012-597-700-992-945; 014-045-448-228-968; 014-560-350-901-997; 014-768-754-999-313; 015-537-977-204-336; 016-140-576-843-357; 016-216-735-430-372; 016-475-292-873-68X; 016-962-712-491-943; 017-709-159-607-177; 018-537-849-154-88X; 019-897-475-251-41X; 023-923-178-342-877; 026-931-122-861-538; 027-386-920-294-895; 027-823-972-181-107; 028-716-688-385-439; 028-802-252-344-012; 031-521-973-430-153; 031-540-953-436-703; 031-911-929-410-650; 032-420-479-586-623; 032-799-798-113-881; 036-902-840-704-756; 038-439-180-047-201; 039-010-174-687-899; 040-229-676-588-390; 045-483-901-061-196; 046-729-998-989-866; 046-838-665-978-125; 048-148-537-416-261; 048-948-865-364-355; 051-830-014-198-867; 053-980-181-429-956; 063-932-709-526-882; 064-240-859-714-503; 069-685-977-197-15X; 070-171-023-805-414; 074-088-259-080-980; 075-015-864-957-620; 076-049-038-650-311; 078-026-432-837-556; 078-885-838-695-135; 079-196-971-304-319; 080-268-439-482-149; 081-382-108-138-592; 082-848-132-695-426; 084-253-680-547-061; 087-972-727-088-705; 088-175-727-127-094; 088-236-621-248-724; 090-235-500-995-608; 091-507-667-867-467; 092-043-536-126-478; 094-220-383-468-828; 095-263-397-244-602; 097-400-866-532-844; 097-783-604-729-760; 098-638-478-619-258; 099-431-463-200-284; 101-012-916-569-644; 103-112-301-998-208; 103-141-730-898-275; 103-343-401-486-232; 103-989-366-241-549; 105-027-928-982-484; 106-735-246-652-211; 108-531-822-357-682; 109-130-999-939-986; 111-293-161-251-748; 115-642-860-718-878; 118-690-527-436-688; 120-075-843-630-244; 122-193-974-026-944; 125-401-076-290-201; 125-587-605-251-178; 127-785-284-544-120; 130-084-777-945-13X; 130-819-612-827-412; 131-350-616-096-363; 131-436-496-230-413; 134-216-684-686-244; 135-184-421-404-164; 141-101-347-131-583; 147-602-317-956-860; 148-805-925-269-964; 153-985-431-075-897; 161-939-014-674-55X; 163-021-586-740-587; 166-519-155-744-540; 167-952-558-294-226; 168-228-690-607-508; 170-327-959-504-92X; 176-658-844-592-805; 177-075-230-799-424; 179-668-787-180-887; 180-524-585-737-168; 186-231-509-533-744; 188-210-692-322-91X; 189-818-900-851-958; 191-760-728-152-874","25","D.

GOVERNMENT SPONSORED PROGRAMS LIKE THE CROPLAND RESERVE PROGRAM GENERALLY REQUIRE THE PLANTING OF SPECIFI C VEGETATIVE SPE- CIES DURING BUFFER RESTORATION, ALTHOUGH THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUCH AN APPROACH WHEN COMPARED TO RESTORATION BY VOLUNTEER SPECIES IS UNKNOWN. WE STUDIED THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENCES IN VEGETATION STRUCTURE ON AVIAN HABITAT IN RIPARIAN BUFFER ZONES. A 25 M (82 FT) WIDE PLANTED WOODLAND BUFFER, 30 M (98 FT) WIDE GRASS, SHRUB, AND WOODLAND THREE-ZONE BUFFER, AND A 9 M (30 FT) WIDE SHRUB BUFFER WERE EVALUATED FOR HABITAT POTENTIAL USING BREEDING-BIRD COUNTS AND VEGETATION SURVEYS. BIRD DENSITY AND SPE- CIES RICHNESS VARIED WITH THE STRUCTURE OF THE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITIES PRESENT AT THE THREE SITES.

PRIOR TO CREP IMPLEMENTATION, THE NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION SERVICE (NRCS) DEVELOPED A REGIONALLY TAILORED FISH INDEX OF BIOTIC INTEGRITY (IBI) FOR USE AS A WATERSHED ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUE IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA. USING THIS REGIONAL IBI FRAMEWORK, WE EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF RECENTLY ESTABLISHED RIPARIAN BUFFERS ON AQUATIC CONDITION. WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF THE REGIONAL IBI, WE EVALUATED ALL BUFFER SEGMENTS PLANNED BETWEEN 2000 AND 2003. CUMULATIVELY DURING THIS PERIOD, WE ASSESSED STREAM PHYSICAL CONDITION ON 36 BUFFER SITES AND 12 REFERENCE SITES USING THE NRCS STREAM VISUAL ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL (SVAP); WE ALSO ASSESSED THE AQUATIC COMMUNITY AT THESE SITES USING THE IBI. IMPROVEMENTS IN STREAM CONDITION WERE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED AT CERTAIN SITES WITHIN ONE YEAR OF BUFFER ESTABLISHMENT. ALTHOUGH NOT ALL BUFFER PROJECTS RESPONDED WITH POSITIVE TRENDS, MEAN SVAP AND IBI SCORES FOR BUFFERED SITES INCREASED OVER THE COURSE OF THE STUDY, WHEREAS THE TREND ON REFERENCE SITES WAS LEVEL OR SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD. WE OBSERVED POSITIVE IBI RESPONSE AT SITES WITH HIGHLY DISTURBED LOCAL CONDITIONS PRIOR TO BUFFER ESTABLISHMENT COMBINED WITH SMALL, RELATIVELY UNDISTURBED WATERSHEDS ABOVE. SIMPLE SOLUTIONS SUCH AS BUFFER ESTABLISHMENT ALONE CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO PROTECT STREAMS FROM ADVERSE HUMAN IMPACTS THAT OCCUR AT A BROADER SCALE.

HOWEVER, STUDIES ARE LIMITED THAT HAVE EXAMINED BUFFER EFFECTS ON THE QUALITY OF WATER FROM GRAZED PASTURES. SIX TREATMENT AREAS, TWO WITH AGROFORESTRY BUFFERS, TWO WITH GRASS BUFFERS, AND TWO CONTROL TREATMENTS WERE USED TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT AGROFORESTRY AND GRASS BUFFERS CAN BE USED TO EFFECTIVELY REDUCE NPSP FROM PASTURED WATERSHEDS. VEGETATION IN GRASS BUFFER AND PASTURE AREAS INCLUDES RED CLOVER (TRIFOLIUM PRETENSE L.) AND LESPEDEZA (KUMMEROWIA STIPULACEA MAXIM.) PLANTED INTO FESCUE (FESTUCA ARUNDINACEA SCHREB.). EASTERN COTTONWOOD TREES (POPULUS DELTOIDES BORTR. EX MARSH.) WERE PLANTED INTO FESCUE IN AGROFORESTRY BUFFERS.

TREATMENTS WERE INSTRUMENTED WITH TWO-FOOT H FLUMES, WATER SAMPLERS, AND FLOW MEASURING DEVICES IN 2001. COMPOSITE WATER SAMPLES WERE ANALYZED FOR SEDIMENT AND TOTAL NITROGEN AFTER EACH RUNOFF EVENT TO COMPARE TREATMENT DIFFERENCES. TREATMENTS WITH AGROFORESTRY AND GRASS BUFFERS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RUNOFF VOLUMES AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL. THE LOSS OF SEDIMENT AND TOTAL NITROGEN WERE SMALLER FOR THE BUFFERED TREATMENTS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT ESTABLISHMENT OF AGROFORESTRY AND GRASS BUFFERS HELP REDUCE NPSP POLLUTION FROM PASTURED WATERSHEDS.

THE EU ‘NITRATES DIRECTIVE’ (DIRECTIVE 91 ⁄ 676 ⁄ EEC) AND THE WFD (WATER FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE 2000 ⁄ 60 ⁄ EEC) INTRODUCED A SERIES OF MEASURES DESIGNED TO REDUCE AND PREVENT WATER POLLUTION CAUSED OR INDUCED BY NITRATES FROM AGRICULTURAL SOURCES. THEREFORE, THERE IS AN URGENT REQUIREMENT TO CONTROL THE NITRATE CONCENTRATION IN FRESHWATER. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER WAS TO VERIFY THE POTENTIAL CAPACITY OF A SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED AFFORESTED RIPARIAN ZONE IN REMOVING THE EXCESS OF NITROGEN FROM RIVER WATER. 2. A BUFFER ZONE WAS SET WITH IRRIGATION DITCHES, TO PRODUCE A SUBSURFACE WATER FLOW CARRYING WATER FROM THE STUDY RIVER THROUGH THE BUFFER STRIP TO DRAINAGE DITCHES. THIS EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM ENABLES THE CO-OCCURRENCE OF TWO MAIN PROCESSES: VEGETATION ⁄ MICROBIAL NITROGEN UPTAKE AND DENITRIFICATION. BOTH IN SITU DENITRIFICATION AND DENITRIFICATION POTENTIAL WERE MEASURED AT DIFFERENT SOIL DEPTHS, AND NITROGEN REMOVAL OF WATER PASSING THROUGH THE BUFFER SYSTEM WAS MEASURED. 3. AFTER THE FIRST YEAR, HIGH REMOVAL RATES (63–64%) OF TOTAL NITROGEN IN WATER WERE RECORDED. THE LOWEST RATE OF DENITRIFICATION TOOK PLACE IN THE UPPER SOIL LAYER, WHILE MAXIMUM DENITRIFICATION OCCURRED IN THE MEDIUM LAYER (40–55 CM). DENITRIFICATION OCCURRED MAINLY IN THE FIRST FEW METRES OF THE IRRIGATION DITCHES LEADING AWAY FROM THE RIVER. THE DENITRIFICATION RATES CLEARLY INCREASED FROM THE SECOND TO THE THIRD YEAR, WITH HIGHEST RATES IN SUMMER AND AUTUMN. DENITRIFICATION POTENTIAL INDICATED THAT CARBON AVAILABILITY WAS THE MOST LIMITING FACTOR. 4. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. THIS STUDY HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT NITROGEN LEVELS CAN BE REDUCED IN RIVERS BY FORCING WATER TO CIRCULATE THROUGH AFFORESTED BUFFERS. NITROGEN WAS REMOVED BOTH BY PLANTS AND BY MICROBIAL DENITRIFICATION. SUCH ACTIVITY CAN BE SUPPORTED BY PROMOTING ANOXIC CONDITIONS THROUGH APPROPRIATE WATER FLOW MANAGEMENT. THIS COULD BE ACHIEVED BY CREATING SEMI-NATURAL FLOODPLAINS WHERE WATER FLOWS CAN BE EFFICIENTLY MANAGED AS IN A DRAINED WETLAND.","48","5","1135","1144","SUBSURFACE FLOW; RIPARIAN ZONE; EUTROPHICATION; ECOLOGY; WATER QUALITY; WATER FLOW; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; BUFFER STRIP; DENITRIFICATION; ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING; WATER POLLUTION","","","","","https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02025.x https://www.acquerisorgive.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Journal-of-Applied-Ecology.pdf http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02025.x/abstract https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02025.x https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02025.x http://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND44760255 https://core.ac.uk/display/53451678","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1111/J.1365-2664.2011.02025.X","","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02025.x","2117386056","","0","002-366-294-773-665; 002-570-479-419-484; 004-564-524-148-882; 007-260-832-996-388; 008-422-030-312-12X; 015-075-787-498-325; 015-514-563-181-208; 017-917-296-565-694; 018-800-193-760-785; 019-956-026-948-622; 020-162-258-114-150; 021-264-049-632-756; 029-294-447-653-235; 037-869-723-647-435; 039-860-735-667-734; 040-665-244-257-257; 044-456-125-092-896; 047-857-691-947-082; 051-607-714-466-701; 060-696-157-887-32X; 061-912-798-524-529; 076-551-861-300-215; 088-526-158-902-16X; 088-590-628-546-902; 092-370-833-437-326; 093-184-946-875-581; 100-845-850-323-114; 102-006-996-908-647; 103-848-538-051-911; 104-993-597-055-071; 105-505-394-565-996; 110-480-586-717-651; 114-392-766-318-899; 125-765-250-241-518; 130-113-631-399-199; 141-101-347-131-583; 168-228-690-607-508; 176-961-483-594-048; 179-792-835-023-017; 186-231-509-533-744","25","BRUNA GUMIERO; BRUNO BOZ; PAOLO CORNELIO; SERGIO CASELLA","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","","LENS",0,"GUMIERO B, 2011, JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","GUMIERO B, 2011, JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY"

HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THEIR PROXIMITY TO AGRICULTURAL SITES, FIELD MARGINS CAN BE AFFECTED BY INPUTS OF PESTICIDES AND FERTILIZERS. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE ASSESSED THE USE OF FIELD MARGINS BY CATERPILLARS AS HABITAT. FURTHERMORE, THE EFFECTS OF REALISTIC FIELD MARGIN INPUT RATES OF VARIOUS AGROCHEMICALS ON MOTHS, ESPECIALLY ON THEIR CATERPILLAR STAGES, WERE STUDIED IN FIELD, SEMI-FIELD, AND LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS. OUR MONITORING RESULTS INDICATE THAT, ALTHOUGH CATERPILLARS WERE FOUND IN FIELD MARGINS, THEIR MEAN ABUNDANCE WAS 35–60% LOWER COMPARED TO MEADOWS. IN A FIELD EXPERIMENT, THE INSECTICIDE TREATMENT (PYRETHROID, LAMBDA-CYHALOTHRIN) SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF CATERPILLARS AND ONLY 15% OF THE SAMPLED CATERPILLARS OCCURRED IN THE INSECTICIDE-TREATED PLOTS. FURTHERMORE, THE INSECTICIDE AFFECTED THE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OF THE CATERPILLARS, WHEREAS THE FERTILIZER TREATMENT SLIGHTLY INCREASED THE CATERPILLAR ABUNDANCE. IN LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS, MAMESTRA BRASSICAE CATERPILLARS WERE SHOWN TO BE VERY SENSITIVE WHEN EXPOSED TO INSECTICIDE-TREATED LEAVES (RATE THAT KILLS 50% OF THE TEST CATERPILLARS (LR50) AFTER 48 H: 0.78% OF THE RECOMMENDED FIELD RATE; THIS RATE CORRESPONDS TO THE ARABLE SPRAY DRIFT INPUT IN FIELD MARGINS AT A DISTANCE OF 3–4 M FROM THE CROP), AND THE CATERPILLARS ALSO APPEARED TO AVOID FEEDING ON THE TREATED LEAVES. IN ADDITION, IN A SEMI-FIELD STUDY, 40% FEWER EGGS OF HADENA BICRURIS MOTHS WERE FOUND ON SILENE LATIFOLIA PLANTS SPRAYED WITH THE INSECTICIDE COMPARED TO CONTROL PLANTS AND THE FLOWERS OF INSECTICIDE-TREATED PLANTS WERE LESS LIKELY TO BE POLLINATED BY MOTHS. OVERALL, THESE STUDIES ILLUSTRATE THAT MOTHS USE FIELD MARGINS AS HABITATS AND THAT THEY CAN BE AFFECTED BY REALISTIC INPUT RATES OF AGROCHEMICALS. AS CATERPILLARS ARE IMPORTANT PREY ORGANISMS AND ADULT MOTHS CAN ACT AS POLLINATORS, INPUTS OF AGROCHEMICALS IN FIELD MARGINS SHOULD BE REDUCED TO MAINTAIN BIODIVERSITY IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES.","207","","153","162","POLLINATOR; CROP; PESTICIDE; POLLINATION; LEPIDOPTERA GENITALIA; PREDATION; CATERPILLAR; AGRONOMY; FIELD EXPERIMENT; BIOLOGY","","","","","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Melanie_Hahn5/publication/275218785_The_effects_of_agrochemicals_on_Lepidoptera_with_a_focus_on_moths_and_their_pollination_service_in_field_margin_habitats/links/553a1b5c0cf245bdd7623639.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880915001346","HTTP://DX.DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.AGEE.2015.04.002","","10.1016/j.agee.2015.04.002","2048634258","","0","003-079-703-747-674; 005-119-127-982-532; 010-777-820-136-567; 010-871-531-175-560; 011-726-790-203-306; 012-531-996-361-584; 015-452-961-176-032; 016-479-451-858-996; 017-617-892-949-438; 018-860-777-046-547; 019-792-723-425-474; 020-550-742-896-582; 022-418-213-259-750; 022-438-869-235-426; 023-896-277-403-275; 024-176-803-210-82X; 033-729-706-192-459; 034-281-941-035-983; 034-650-492-697-500; 035-232-166-827-095; 037-908-404-608-059; 038-305-195-221-272; 043-213-251-246-857; 045-341-621-939-351; 045-628-056-763-549; 045-845-890-255-360; 046-513-869-126-279; 048-164-819-953-006; 048-550-347-828-56X; 050-907-802-597-89X; 052-363-993-930-092; 054-190-974-057-937; 056-244-188-471-763; 056-789-845-462-569; 058-652-902-995-042; 059-106-092-531-26X; 059-502-071-789-055; 059-591-995-881-051; 061-266-379-556-653; 061-515-851-860-160; 063-003-550-683-547; 064-314-121-953-160; 066-173-478-189-114; 072-410-559-402-62X; 073-703-689-720-592; 074-793-529-288-006; 075-222-492-546-135; 084-932-304-217-75X; 087-403-027-064-454; 090-918-892-557-975; 096-986-804-938-077; 097-108-057-805-779; 098-863-802-212-865; 100-194-169-502-836; 104-519-739-211-685; 110-883-392-022-284; 114-480-653-531-829; 117-345-687-903-78X; 125-995-631-935-63X; 136-377-088-150-806; 137-057-794-081-178; 140-373-290-241-230; 140-804-099-486-389; 140-908-676-431-836; 142-624-071-999-929; 150-260-537-510-335; 153-513-858-008-911; 157-398-673-150-430; 162-199-054-878-245; 165-804-108-473-473; 190-423-081-433-021","18","MELANIE HAHN; ANNALENA SCHOTTHÖFER; JULIANE SCHMITZ; LEA FRANKE; CARSTEN A.

TO BETTER UNDERSTAND; THESE PROCESSES, A RUNOFF STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE VEGETATED BUFFER STRIPS PERFORMANCE IN REDUCING ATRAZINE,; METOLACHLOR, AND CHLORPYRIFOS TRANSPORT AS AFFECTED BY THE DRAINAGE AREA TO BUFFER STRIP AREA RATIO. THE SIMULATED RUNOFF WATER; MIXED WITH PESTICIDE–TREATED SOIL WAS DISTRIBUTED ONTO SIX VEGETATED BUFFER STRIPS, EACH 1.52 M WIDE . 20.12 M LONG, LOCATED; DOWNSLOPE OF THE INFLOW DISTRIBUTION TANK IN A WELL ESTABLISHED VEGETATED GRASSED WATERWAY. THESE STRIPS PROVIDED FOR THREE; REPLICATIONS OF TWO INFLOW RATES DESIGNATED AS “DRAINAGE AREA/BUFFER STRIP AREA RATIO TREATMENTS” OF 15:1 AND 30:1. INFILTRATION; FOR THE 15:1 TREATMENT AVERAGED 38.8% OF THE INFLOW VOLUME, WHEREAS IT AVERAGED 30.4% FOR THE 30:1 TREATMENT. SEDIMENT; RETENTION EFFICIENCIES AVERAGED 90.1% AND 86.8% FOR THE 15:1 AND 30:1 TREATMENTS, RESPECTIVELY. CONCENTRATIONS OF ATRAZINE; AND METOLACHLOR ASSOCIATED WITH SEDIMENT OUTFLOWS FROM THE STRIPS WERE LARGER THAN THEIR RESPECTIVE INFLOW CONCENTRATIONS,; WHILE THE RESULTS WERE OPPOSITE FOR CHLORPYRIFOS. CONCENTRATIONS IN RUNOFF WATER FOR BOTH ATRAZINE AND METOLACHLOR IN OUTFLOW; FROM THE STRIPS WERE SMALLER THAN THE INFLOW CONCENTRATIONS; AGAIN, THE RESULTS WERE OPPOSITE FOR CHLORPYRIFOS. THE 15:1; TREATMENT RETAINED AN AVERAGE OF 52.5% OF THE TOTAL INPUT OF ATRAZINE, 54.4% OF METOLACHLOR, AND 83.1% OF CHLORPYRIFOS.; CORRESPONDING NUMBERS FOR THE 30:1 TREATMENT WERE 46.8% FOR ATRAZINE, 48.1% FOR METOLACHLOR, AND 76.9% FOR CHLORPYRIFOS.; ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE USING THE RANDOMIZED BLOCK DESIGN SHOWED THAT DIFFERENCES OF PERCENT RETENTION OF PESTICIDE BETWEEN; TREATMENTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR ANY OF THE THREE PESTICIDES AT THE 10% SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL. A LACK OF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE; INDICATES EITHER A NEED FOR MORE THAN THREE REPLICATIONS AND/OR LARGER AREA RATIO TREATMENTS TO BE STUDIED. THE RESULTS OF THIS; STUDY INDICATE THAT A 30:1 AREA RATIO BUFFER STRIP COULD PERFORM EQUALLY AS WELL AS A 15:1 AREA RATIO BUFFER STRIP.

BIRD DENSITY WAS ESTIMATED BY MAPPING METHOD IN SUCCESSIVE YEARS 1996–2001 AND THE DATA WERE COMBINED AND ANALYSED IN RESPECT TO AGE OF SHELTERBELTS. EIGHTEEN BREEDING SPECIES WERE FOUND (5–8 PAIRS KM–1), AMONG THEM MOST ABUNDANT WERE CORN BUNTING (MILIARIA CALANDRA) (WITH DOMINANCE OF 33%), YELLOW WAGTAIL (MOTACILLA FLAVA) (19%) AND WHITETHROAT (SYLVIA COMMUNIS) (12%). NO TREND IN THE CHANGES OF SPECIES RICHNESS AND TOTAL DENSITY WAS RECORDED. THE DENSITY OF SPECIES PREFERRING BUILDING NESTS AND/OR FEEDING IN HERB LAYER (LIKE YELLOW WAGTAIL, SKYLARK ALAUDA ARVENSIS AND WHINCHAT SAXICOLA RUBETRA) DECREASED DURING STUDY PERIOD WHILE THE DENSITY OF SPECIES ASSOCIATED TO HIGHER LAYERS OF VEGETATION LIKE YELLOWHAMMER (EMBERIZA CITRINELLA), RED-BACKED SHRIKE (LANIUS COLLURIO) INCREASED. ACCORDING TO EARLIER STUDY, BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE IN STUDIED YOUNG SHELTERBELTS WERE LOWER THAN IN SEVERAL DOZENS YEARS OLD ONES. HOWEVER, IN RELATION TO SPECIES COLONIZATION BOTH CLASSES OF SHELTERBELTS (SPECIES BUILDING THEIR NESTS ON THE GROUND OR IN LOW SHRUBS), YOUNG SHELTERBELTS WERE AS IMPORTANT AS OLD ONES.","52","4","433","443","ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; CORN BUNTING; ALAUDA; SHRIKE; LANIUS COLLURIO; YELLOWHAMMER; EMBERIZA CITRINELLA; SAXICOLA RUBETRA; SPECIES RICHNESS","","","","","http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-article-6f93dbc4-c278-488f-927f-6b8fc104bf64","HTTP://YADDA.ICM.EDU.PL/YADDA/ELEMENT/BWMETA1.ELEMENT.AGRO-ARTICLE-6F93DBC4-C278-488F-927F-6B8FC104BF64","","","2047088526","","0","003-493-278-314-619; 029-904-475-177-008","7","K.

HOWEVER, PSEUDO- SCORPIONS WERE MOST NUMEROUS ON TREATMENTS WHICH INVOLVED NO MANAGEMENT BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE IN LEAF LITTER WHICH MAY REPLICATE A WOODLAND ENVIRONMENT. ADJACENT HEDGES APPEAR TO BUFFER THE EFFECTS OF MANAGEMENT: MARGINS WITH ADJACENT HEDGES (RATHER THAN DITCHES OR TRACKS) HAVING MORE INDIVIDUALS. IN CONTRAST TO RESULTS FOR OTHER INVERTEBRATE GROUPS, SOWING WILDFLOWER SEED DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE ABUNDANCE OF PSEUDOSCORPIONS.

GRASS HEDGES MAY REDUCE RUNOFF LOSSES OF NUTRIENTS AND SEDIMENT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF NARROW SWITCHGRASS (PANICUM VIRGATUM L.) HEDGES (−0.75 M WIDE) ON THE TRANSPORT OF P AND N FROM A FIELD RECEIVING BEEF CATTLE FEEDLOT MANURE UNDER TILLED AND NO-TILL CONDITIONS. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON A STEEP (12 % AVERAGE SLOPE) MONONA SILT LOAM (FINE-SILTY, MIXED, SUPERACTIVE, MESIC TYPIC HAPLUDOLLS) SOIL NEAR TREYNOR, IOWA. THE EXPERIMENT WAS A SPLIT-PLOT WITH NO-TILL AND DISKED SYSTEMS AS MAIN PLOTS AND SUBPLOTS OF MANURE, FERTILIZER, AND CHECK WITH OR WITHOUT A GRASS HEDGE. A RAINFALL SIMULATOR WAS USED AND RUNOFF WAS COLLECTED FROM BOTH THE INITIAL AND THE FOLLOWING WET SIMULATIONS. ONLY 38% OF THE NO-TILL PLOTS AND 63% OF DISKED PLOTS HAD ANY RUNOFF DURING THE INITIAL 6.4 CM HR−1 WATER APPLICATION. A SINGLE NARROW GRASS HEDGE REDUCED RUNOFF CONCENTRATIONS OF DISSOLVED P (DP) BY 47%, BIOAVAILABLE P (BAP) BY 48%, PARTICULATE P (PP) BY 38%, TOTAL P (TP) BY 40%, AND NH4-N BY 60% DURING THE WET SIMULATION ON THE NO-TILL PLOTS RECEIVING MANURE, COMPARED WITH SIMILAR PLOTS WITH NO HEDGES. THE CORRESPONDING REDUCTIONS IN CONCENTRATIONS AS A RESULT OF A GRASS HEDGE FOR DP, BAP, PP, TP, AND NH4-N ON THE DISKED PLOTS WERE 21, 29, 43, 38, AND 52%, RESPECTIVELY. RUNOFF NH4-N CONCENTRATION FROM FERTILIZER APPLIED TO THE DISKED PLOTS WAS REDUCED BY 61%, NO3-N BY 21%, AND TOTAL N (TN) BY 27% DURING THE WET SIMULATION WHEN GRASS HEDGES WERE USED. GRASS HEDGES ALSO REDUCED TOTAL QUANTITIES OF DP, BAP, TP, AND NH4-N DURING THE WET SIMULATION. THE TP LOSS WAS 3.3% OF APPLIED P FERTILIZER AND WAS 0.3% OF APPLIED MANURE P. NARROW GRASS HEDGES WERE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING P AND N LOSSES IN RUNOFF FROM BOTH MANURE AND FERTILIZER APPLICATION.","55","2","172","176","LOAM; SOIL WATER; EUTROPHICATION; PANICUM VIRGATUM; FERTILIZER; MANURE; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE; SURFACE RUNOFF; AGRONOMY; MOLLISOL","","","","","https://www.jswconline.org/content/55/2/172 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/17111 https://www.jswconline.org/content/55/2/172.full.pdf https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/biosysengfacpub/128/ https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20001915647 http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1127&context=biosysengfacpub https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=707765","HTTPS://WWW.JSWCONLINE.ORG/CONTENT/55/2/172","","","1888844715","","0","029-227-515-568-324; 057-131-240-501-938; 065-179-468-781-895; 076-826-572-086-275; 089-389-691-942-205; 144-279-645-115-466","78","BAHMAN EGHBALL; JOHN E.

PROXIMITY OF A HEDGEROW HAD A MAJOR IMPACT UPON POPULATION DYNAMICS, WITH MORE SPECIES AND A GREATER OVER ALL ABUNDANCE NEAR FIELD EDGES. IT WAS THE MAJOR FACTOR GOVERNING THE ABUNDANCE OF ISOTOMURUS PALUSTRIS AND BOURLETIELLA HORTENSIS, WHEREAS CROP TYPE WAS MOST IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING NUMBERS OF JEANNENOTIA STACHI, SMINTHURUS VIRIDIS, SMINTHURINUS ELEGANS AND LEPIDOCYRUS SPP. TEMPORAL VARIATION IN SPECIES ABUNDANCE WAS ALSO CLEAR: ABUNDANCES OF J. STACHI, B. HORTENSIS, I. PALUSTRIS AND LEPIDOCYRTUS SPP. DECREASED THROUGH THE SAMPLING PERIOD WHILE THOSE OF S.
